[{"comment":"This is a solid 32gb card.  I have used it in a Galaxy 3 Note, and it will capture HD video without a hiccup.  Using it with the adapter, I get about 25-30mb\/second transfer rates when using it in a USB 2.0 port to transfer media files of around 10-30mb in size.My only qualm is with the USB adapter.  The metal was not machined well and would not plug in to many USB ports without significant effort.  It was too tight.  But the adapter is a bit of an extra here.Samsung makes good memory, and this card is no exception.  Highly recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"This Samsung 16 GB micro SD card is great.I've been using SanDisks exclusively for years, never knowing of any other \"better\" brands than Kingston which is a couple of dollars more for the same specs.There IS a difference with the Samsung cards.  And, I first noticed this when I upgraded my tablet to a Galaxy Note 10.1  in June, then I bought a Samsung 64 GB micro SD for it.  The tablet's functions, from going from app to app and from video to streaming to the Kindle reading app is pronounced.Although the 16 GB is great for most purposes, I would only recommend this for the higher-end phones where you'll see a noticeable difference than on a budget phone.  I'd also recommend the 64 for the better tablets-- I don't think you'll see a performance difference if you went with a SanDisk or a Kingston if you have an average phone or tablet to work with.","rating":5},{"comment":"My wife is using the card as an expansion in her Samsung Galaxy 5S, and it is working very well.  I have had experience with these cards before and they are quite fast at 48MB\/s.  The very small USB 2.0 reader is great for ease-of-use data transfer, essentially converting SDHCs to a thumb drive format.  No more looking for full-size card adapters and an external card reader.  We leave it plugged into my wife's home laptop and it is available whenever we need ti to read the supplied card and any other SDHCs,  Highly recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"I'm using this as a memory expansion for my Galaxy Note 3.

I own several of their TVs, which are very reliable and awesome, so I was happy to get the chance to review this product. The business end of this reader, the USB 2.0 plug that holds the Micro SDHC card, is sleek and small. The card itself is your standard-size micro SDHC (of course), but of the highest class, so data transfer is fast. You can't go wrong with Samsung or with this product.","rating":5},{"comment":"Very nice USB reader.  It's compact and attractive, and easily attached to a keychain.  You could use this as a flash drive without much risk of the card ejecting, because the loop for a keyring string extends just far enough out to avoid accidental ejection.The microSD card is extremely fast in my phone, and I've noticed a remarkable loading speed gain over my Class 4 card when paying GTA San Andreas or taking multiple photos on my Galaxy S3.The card is robustly made, which is rarely a consideration for microSD cards, but it is worth noting.There's nothing earth shaking about this product, yet it is thoughtfully designed and well made, and for that reason I think it's definitely worth the price.  I've had half a dozen SD and microSD card readers, and all of them have been poorly built and failed quickly.  This one is simply far better built.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a high-speed microSD card with a USB reader. This microSD card is rated at SD class 10 and UHS 1. SD class 10 means that the card can perform sequential read\/write operations, the kind needed for video or picture recording, at speeds of at least 10Mb\/second. The USH 1 rating means that the card is suitable for 1080p video recording. Compared to other microSD cards, this one has very fast random access read\/write speeds, which makes it an exceptionally good choice for data storage on phones or tablets. The card is quite durable, rated for temperatures -18F to +185F, waterproof, magnet proof, and X-ray proof, and it comes with a 10 year warranty. The included USB (2) reader for microSD cards enables you to transfer data easily between the card and any computer or device with a USB slot.I got this card for my Sony video camera, and I've been quite pleased at the card's performance so far. It is plenty speedy for HD video recording, and the USB reader makes it a snap to transfer the video files onto my computer. Overall, this is a fast card suitable for video camera usage or data storage on handheld devices such as phones or tablets. And the included USB reader for microSD cards is very handy.","rating":5},{"comment":"This microSD card can add 16GB to your Android smartphone or tablet. Not  a lot of space these day, consider you can get 64GB for around $35. The USB adaptor is compact, and could be used for other higher cpacity microSD card.

The reason I selected this item is for use in my DSLR camera which takes standard SD cards.I liked the idea that I could put this microSD card in an SD adapter and insert it into my camera. With the card being rated class 10 it should be good enough for that application. Then I could remove the card and put it into my Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone so I could view my photos on that large screen.The USB adapter is a bonus which would allow me to view the photos on my laptop or desktop computer. However, for me, an SD adapter would be even more practical than the USB adapter. I made sure my new laptop had an SD card reader. For those who's laptop doesn't have an SD card reader the USB adapter would be more practical.I tried the card in my camera right away and it performed flawlessly. I can store a bit over 1,900 jpg photos from my camera, which has a 24MB sensor, on the card. That would be enough for a week long vacation.I rated it 4 stars because there are other, even faster, 16GB micro SD cards available (with an SD adapter) for $12 on Amazon while this one is listed at $19 so a bit expensive relative to other products.","rating":4},{"comment":"This Micro SDHC card with USB 2.0 Reader works great.  I needed a Micro USB for my Lumia 520 phone and this did the trick.  It is fast and with the USB reader, I was able to move my music over very easily and quickly from my computer to my phone.  Since my computer doesn't have an SD card port, I was unable to do this before so I am pretty excited to be able to take advantage of the USB ports on my computer to make the transfers.  Overall, this is a great product.","rating":5},{"comment":"I am a huge user of memory cards. From my phone to my table to my e-reader, I have a memory card for just about every gadget.

Go for USB 3.0Otherwise, works great.","rating":5},{"comment":"For a class 10, this is a little slower than my SD cards that I normally use, but for a micro it is pretty fast. If you are used to using really fast SD cards, don't expect the same performance. However, if you have used other microsd cards, and you are not using a sandisk extreme pro card, you will love this. I love that it comes with a USB reader, so I don't have to look through my SD cards looking for the one that is actually the adapter (especially because it's always the last one).  I also love that it is not &#34;micro&#34; sized. While I understand the need and usefulness of micro-sized things, I also understand my own propensity to lose things, so I love this because it is big enough that I know I won't lose it. It is almost everything proof.....water, x-ray, temperature, and magnet proof. Pretty cool.In comparing this to a SanDisk Extreme Pro micro sd card, it is not as fast, as I mentioned. HOWEVER, it is MUCH cheaper! Unless you are doing a lot of images in burst mode, I don't think you willnotice the difference. This is a great value folks. You can certainly find cheaper, but they will be SLOW....for the price difference, get this, it is totally worth it!","rating":5},{"comment":"So I was smart enough to buck the I-Phone trend and get a Samsung phone.  One of the main deciding factors was that while I Phones are limited to whatever memory you bought preinstalled, a Samsung phone has a micro SD expansion slot to upgrade as needed.  So I popped this card in, the phone immediately recognized it as the place to save all my pictures, and I'm ready to go, with more storage capacity than I'll ever need on a phone.  I especially like that this card is resistant to extreme conditions.  Heaven forbid I should drop my phone into the ocean or lose it in a snowbank overnight,  but anything stored on the card would be safe for up to 24 hours of exposure.  That would be some nice insurance for a waterproof camera too, in case the seals failed.  Also it is Class 10 rated for high performance read\/write speeds.The little keychain card reader is a nice touch too.  It has a nice long connector so it won't be bothered by whatever is in the next USB port.  In summation, this card does everything you'd want out of a micro SD card and at a comparable price point to other brands with the same features.  I highly recommend it.","rating":5},{"comment":"I got this 16GB microSD card from Samsung to add additional memory to my new Samsung Galaxy Tab S.

It also has the capability of working in electronics that use UHS-Class 1. It wasn't all that long ago that an UHS-Class 1 card was very expensive so that if you weren't shooting HD commercially it made more sense to buy a slower card for casual use.  Now, however, with the reduction in price and with the improvement in equipment it's doesn't make any sense to buy a slower card.Comes with a card reader\/USB 2.0 reader\/adaptor that lets you plug it into your computer and copy media file from video to photos and then plug it into your table or phone (or vice versa).","rating":4},{"comment":"If you are looking to add 16 GB (or 32 or 64) of storage space to a phone that can use a MicroSD card, or want to add storage to a Surface Pro tablet, the Samsung EVO series is a good choice.

If your device doesn't have the UHS-1 logo, it will still work but not at the fastest speed advertised here.The included USB adapter seems to work at UHS-1 speeds just fine, as I was tapping out between 30 MB\/s on average on copying files.Not sure what else to say about this card. It's portable, it works well and the included adapter works a charm as well.Recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"Vine offered me this Samsung 16GB EVO Micro SDHC for an honest review. Here&#8217;s my take on it.I only recently joined the ranks of the smartphone users, mainly because I live in a cell dead zone and didn&#8217;t see the need for an upgrade. However, since I do a number of arts and crafts shows and learned the Samsung Galaxy Centaura can be used for credit card transactions, I decided to spring for it. Next I discovered the added enhancements of WiFi, even in my cell dead area, the ability to text, play Pandora and store music, movies and more on my phone. Okay, now I&#8217;m ex-cited. But the phone only came with a 4GB micro SDHC, so getting the new one was a no-brainer.It&#8217;s nice that the USB 2.0 reader is included, but I&#8217;m especially interested in the (up to) 48MB\/s transfer speed and that it&#8217;s designed for the latest smartphones and tablets. I want fast speed when moving memory-intensive files and this does a very nice job in that category, plus I trust the Samsung name and reputation. Additionally, I can capture shots twice as fast as with conventional microSD cards (This card is a Class 10 where my 4GB card was only a Class 2). The 16GB capacity allows up to 9,300 8-megapixel photos, 270 minutes of HD video or 3,740 songs, way more than I will ever need. And while I don&#8217;t envision dropping my phone in the ocean or a snowbank, it&#8217;s reassuring to know the card can withstand up to 24 hours in seawater or temperatures from -13 to 185 degrees.I don&#8217;t see the need to remove the card from my phone, but should I need it for another use, the included USB 2.0 reader (with keychain) allows me to use it in any device with a USB 2.0 port.While this isn&#8217;t the cheapest 16GB card on the market, I feel the Samsung quality negates the price difference. In short, I&#8217;m very satisfied with the card and performance.","rating":5},{"comment":"I purchased this micro SDHC card for my Samsung Galaxy S5.

You can charge the tablet with the case closed and it has the right cutouts for the camera.The corners of the case are plastic and the tablet fits into them securely. I like it much better than the elasticized corners that are in some covers as they detract from the screen and the beauty of the tablet. The cover folds out to prop up the tablet although it's not very secure and the tablet can topple. I prefer to hold it in my hand most of the time due to it's shape and the cover makes it easier to hold.Overall I recommend the case for it's simplicity and construction.

Thus far, I absolutely love the case's durability.  I have been able to keep my tablet protected after dropping it once (or twice).

It would be a great adjustment to add an opening.Final Rating: 4 stars","rating":4},{"comment":"I bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 about months ago and have been using an Icon 10\" case.  The Icon case is great because it has thin elastic straps that hold the tablet in but there's no side protection to the ports.This Belkin has a rubber housing with all of the port openings including the opening for the \"S\" pen.This case can also bend to act as a stand.The top cover is a vinyl sheet and the interior is a felt cloth.The case feels durable and it's an exact cut, maybe an 1\/8 exceeding the tablet all the way around.  Not much protection from a fall but a great form factor.","rating":5},{"comment":"I really like this Belkin Samsung Galaxy Pro 8.4 cover. Its made from real leather, is thicker than the OEM one I received when I got my Galaxy Pro 8.4 as a gift from my wife. This cover I believe offers better protection than the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer = Made by and for this product). I was all set to use this and get rid of the cover my wife had selected until.... until I closed the cover and my 8.4 Pro remained turned on. Oh No, not a good thing. The OEM cover, like her Kindle, turns off or goes into sleep mode as soon as the cover is closed, then upon opening the cover, it turns right back on again. However, this Belkin does not do this. What does this mean, well once you close the flap, it stays on running down your battery. I am sorry but I can't have that after being spoiled by the OEM cover that turns on & off all by itself just by opening or closing the lid. I give it 4-stars because of the quality. I was going to give it only 3-stars, but it is a really nice case.","rating":4},{"comment":"The Belkin Tri-Fold case is 3 stars because there is no real innovation - just a cover that has good cut outs for a specific product. The case fits the 10.1 Galaxy Tab Pro perfectly and works well as a cover but (1) is a little bulky, and (2 is really designed for the 45 degree viewing angle rather than the lower angle shown in the picture.The purple color is more plum than deep purple, and is a pleasant color.  The closure is an elastic band that slips over the front flap (old style).  Closing of the flap does not put the tablet in sleep mode.  The cover has cut outs for headphones, back camera, and the charging plug when in the 45 degree angle.  When lower, the cutouts do not match because you have to turn the Galaxy Tab Pro around to achieve the lower viewing angle.Overall, the Belkin cover is reminiscent of the old style covers - a bit bulky and limited. The fit, however, it perfect.","rating":3},{"comment":"I've used this cover for a while now and find it ok.  It is soft to the touch, covers the screen and adds some protection, though not a lot.  It fits the table well and takes a little effort remove.  My main complaint, with the tri-fold, I can never get the angle that's comfortable for viewing.  Maybe it's just me, but I'm constantly trying to prop it up a little more than I get with just the cover.I feel this is a decent cover and I can recommend it.  If you have a chance I would suggest trying it first to see if the tri-angle support works for you.","rating":4},{"comment":"Having seen and tried my son-in-law's MoKo case, I'm compelled to do a comparative review. The Belkin and MoKo are the same price. The similarities end there.The Belkin will protect your tablet. The fit is excellent for the Tab Pro 10.1 (NOT the Tab 3 10.1), and all the holes for speakers and plugs are in the right place. That said, I expected the tri-fold to stand better. Instead, my tablet in landscape mode tends to fall backward no matter which fold I use. The tri-fold does nothing for portrait mode, but I will say that the case is comfortable to hold just reading an ebook.The leather doesn't feel like leather, and seems to be of a lesser quality than the MoKo.The most disappointing thing is that the case does not have an auto-on\/auto-off &#34;switch;&#34; i.e., this is not a magnetic close case which turns your tablet off when you close it. While I received this for review, I must say that an auto-off should be included for the retail price.Three stars is perhaps too low, and four is too high.","rating":3},{"comment":"I must admit I don't have the Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro, but a competitor's 10.1&#34; tablet.

Though the long edges extend a bit on both sides, it covers the screen surface, which is what needs the protecting during travel. I do love the vibrant color, as it's easy to find in the carry-on bag or large purse. Had I the proper model, I'm sure I would have given it 5 stars.","rating":4},{"comment":"The corner fasteners are plastic corners rather than elastic binders. I don't know exactly how snug the tablet would fit (I have a Galaxy Note 10.1 rather than a Tab Pro) My Note tablet does not fit, which I thought it would because they are both supposed to be the same size.The whole case feels cheap, and there is very little cushioning. The tri-fold does work well to prop up the tablet, but if you were to accidentally drop your tablet in this case, I feel sure it would fall out. I don't have much confidence that it would protect the tablet very well at all.It is definitely NOT worth $49!!! Do not waste your money.","rating":1},{"comment":"The Belkin smooth tri-fold folio case is very lightweight, offers good protection and is extremely flexible allowing me to use the tablet in a variety of positions.  My favorite is sitting up an angle so I can use my bluetooth keyboard with exceptional ease.  It's a great case and appears to be made with quality construction. Highly recommend!","rating":5},{"comment":"This case has a nice grippy feel to it when closed and it allows you to stand the tablet in landscape mode.  The case also has a strap to hold it closed as well.  It has 3 tilt positions for comfortable viewing and they all grip very well.  I haven't had the tablet fall at all when using it as a stand.  When you fold the case over backward to use the table handheld in portrait mode, the case cover slides around making it harder to hold but you can slide the cover so it sticks out to the left about a half inch and grab it to the left and that seems to grip well and the cover doesn't slide around but it is difficult to type on it that way.  I'm concerned that the case may not provide adequate protection if the tablet were dropped because of how the corners are designed.  They are open.  But, because the case is grippy, it is less likely that you will drop it.  Last, this case does not have a magnet to turn the display on automatically when you open the cover or turn it off when you close it.  If they fixed those two things, I'd give the case 5 stars.Update: 6\/2\/2014I made a modification to the case to allow it to turn the display on when you open the cover or off when you close it.  The mod involves installing a small magnet in the cover.  With the cover open, measure 4\" from the left edge of the inside front cover and 2\" up from the bottom edge.  Where those two point intersect, you must install a small magnet.  You need a very thin magnet; 1\/32\" is ideal.  The diameter is not important but I used a 1\/4\" diameter magnet.  Carefully cut 3 sides of a square into the fabric with a razor blade or other sharp knife.  Carefully peel back the fabric.  I used a Dremel to cut an indent into the plastic mid layer then I used contact cement to glue the magnet in place and glue the fabric back down over the magnet.  When you are done, you want the cover to be perfectly flat again.  If the magnet protrudes, it can cause pressure on the display which can crack the display if the case is dropped.  That is the last thing you want to happen with your expensive tablet.  Again, I feel this is a feature Belkin should have included in a case at this price point but you can add it yourself with a little patience.  NOTE**  Measurements are for the 8.4\" Sambung Tab Pro, which is what I have.  They may be different for other size or model tablets.","rating":4},{"comment":"At first glance, the Belkin Cinema Stripe Folio Case with Stand for Samsung Galaxy Note and Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro 12.2 models makes a good impression.  Upon closer examination and touching it, the materials of the case are extremely disappointing, regardless of the Belkin as expected great design.  PU leather is not leather, but usually has a split leather backing which is coated with polyurethane, a technique that gives the appearance of leather.  It is faux leather and unfortunately, when the PU coating wears or is nicked, the fake nature becomes blatantly obvious.  Another negative of PU leather products is that they often have an unpleasant odor, as did this case.  The interior material is neither soft nor rough, but has a grip to it which makes for an advantage in protecting the tablet when in the trifold configuration.  The gray color of the interior complements the black exterior and is a shade darker than the gray stripe on the front of the case exterior.  That stripe has pinpoint perforations as an accent, this is absent in the interior.  My tablet snaps easily into the hard plastic shell which is securely fastened to the rear of the tablet and all functions are perfectly accessible with open spaces in the shell.  The folio can be used by folding the front of the case back, or it can be used as a stand, with four grooves in the case for placement of the tablet.  This is a design that is typical of Belkin.  I very much like the rounded corners of the case because this follows the tablet design and the fit is perfect.  The strong magnetic closure does work well and fulfills its function.  Were it not for the materials which I find unappealing and the high cost for this case, it would be great and not just average.  It's not my favorite.","rating":3},{"comment":"We have two brands of tablet cases to compare--this Belkin Folio case and an Ionic Stand Leather Case. My wife and I are split on which we prefer. I prefer the design of the Ionic Stand, and she prefers this Belkin Case. The Belkin case looks great and is well stitched, has flexible plastic clips to hold the corners of your tablet securely, and an elastic band to hold it closed. I don't care so much for the tri-fold design, because it seems stable mostly in the low-incline position. If you reverse it and have it standing at the angle of a lap top screen, I don't think its very stable. That's why I prefer the Ionic stand case, which has a rotating holder that allows you to view your table in portrait or landscape, and a more rigid cover that has three channels or ridges to position the bottom of the tablet in. It seems more stable and allows both positions. My wife doesn't like that one so much, but either will protect your screen from scratches, etc. I don't think these cases are very protective for accidental drops (best just to avoid those), though they are better for nothing. Overall I can't fault the Belkin case much, and it's well made, so four stars.","rating":4},{"comment":"This cover from Belkin utilizes the 'tri-fold' front cover design, meaning that the front cover bends back to form a triangle, which you then use to stand your tablet in a horizontal\/landscape position on a hard surface.  There are two positions--one with a more upright slant that serves as a good angle for typing (I have a Bluetooth keyboard and find this angle is pretty good) or watching movies, and the second if you flip it around, at a lower angled slant.My tablet is held in place by four rubbery-plasticy corners that work really well securing the cover to it.  The corners have enough flex in them that they are easy to bend in the event I want to remove my tablet.  They also have enough rubbery feel to them that I feel they would serve as bumpers in the event I drop my tablet.Other features include an elastic strap that can be snapped over from its place on the back to hold the front cover closed.  There is no magnetic closure, just this elastic strap.  As you would expect, there are precise cutouts for the back-facing camera and the charge\/USB port at the bottom.  Because this cover is made to fold and stand in a horizontal position, when holding the tablet in portrait mode, it seems backwards to me. The top edge of the tablet is on the right, and the bottom is on the left. This means that when in portrait mode, if I tuck the front of the cover behind, my left thumb is constantly hitting the 'back,' 'home' and 'close all' buttons along the left side while I am using my right hand to navigate the touchscreen.  I guess I'll have to learn to be a southpaw.Two minor complaints:  I find tri-fold covers by design make for a 'bouncy' stand. This one is no exception.  If you're viewing a movie this is not a problem, but if you're constantly touching the screen then it bounces all over the place.  My other complaint with this design is that it is the inside felt of the cover that touches the standing surface, so when you unfold it and close it, all that dust and grit goes onto your tablet's screen.  So remember to clean the desk or table before using.I'm not sure what this cover is made from--it has a soft leathery feel but I don't think it is real leather.  I could not find anywhere on the box where it told me, only that it's Made in China.  Overall, this is a pretty decent cover for my Galaxy Tab Pro, nice quality and of a simple design.  It's a bit pricy though, for being so plain, so it gets three-average-stars from me.","rating":3},{"comment":"I have loved Belkin products from phone cases to chargers, and this is no exception.  This case fits the Galaxy Tab perfectly with accessibility where you need it for charging, etc.  The tri-fold also works very well as you might expect from numerous tri-fold cases out there.  There's no substantial game changer here, but there's no reason to knock this down.  I would recommend this for use with your Galaxy Tab!","rating":5},{"comment":"I have had multiple Belkin cases over the years. Some are great and some are &#34;functional&#34;.  I  have already switched back to my Pellem. The build quality of the case is good.  The multiple position stand is great for having your tablet at different angles.  The reason for three stars is the case adds large amount of extra bulk versus the Pellem that I am using now.  Additionally, Belkin to not include a magnet to auto turn the screen off and on.  Sure your tablet screen times out and goes into a idle state but having the magnet makes it that much quicker.If you are looking for a case that is a good stand and do not mind the extra bulk then this case will fill your need.  I would recommend  looking at all other cases available for the Tab Pro 8.4 that may also fill your need at a lower cost","rating":3},{"comment":"This review is for the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4 case (I notice Amazon mixes various sizes into the same product page).  If you insist on a real leather case, then this one is fine but it's on the expensive side for me.The good points: The case offers good protection for the tablet and has a nice feel to it. The interior in particular is soft and won't do any damage to the glass on the tablet. There's a sturdy strap that keeps the case closed. The cutouts are placed properly. I like the way you can adjust the viewing angle and the tablet does a good job at maintaining that angle and providing a good base when you tap the screen.Not as good points: The four corner tabs that hold the tablet in place don't look particularly good. The color and texture don't really match the rest of the case.  The case also has somewhat of a flimsy feel when you open and close it because the spine or hinge part is not solid; you can shift the cover up and down when it is closed without the strap on.Personally, I prefer my Pellem SC2014.  It isn't leather, but it is sturdy, slimmer, looks better and is much less expensive. It also uses a magnet for closure.  The only thing it lacks is the ability to adjust the viewing angle.  That said, the Belkin is a nice case if you insist on leather.","rating":4},{"comment":"I want to emphasize that this review is for the Galaxy Note 12.2 cover...apparently the other sizes have different features, and the reviews for the various sizes are all lumped together here.As a point of note, I have purchased quite a few tablet covers over the years..for Kindle e-readers, a Kindle Fire HDX (8.9\"), a Toshiba Thrive, and three HP Touchpads I bought for my sons during the great \"fire sale\" a while back, each of which has a different cover design.  So, I've learned how to be picky when it comes to tablet covers.Here are the features I look for when I shop for a tablet cover:Keep the tablet thin and light so I can easily and safely slip it into and out of my briefcaseProvide good protectionHave a \"snap-in\" holder for itClose securelyHave the wake\/sleep functionThis Belkin for the Tab Pro 12.2 case does all of the above. The tablet fits into the snap-in plastic holder perfectly and once in, it is definitely secure. I've tried case covers before that have the corner bendy things to hold the tablet in, and another bendy thing on the center of the front cover to grasp the tablet body when you close it (hope you know what I mean). I've found that over time they become too flexible and don't work very well, which is why I prefer a snap-in holder instead.Also, all of the cut-out sections are perfectly placed for the camera, volume control, on\/off button, etc.  The sides are fairly open, whereby you can easily access the USB port, the micro SD card slot, and which also allows the speakers on the sides to remain unobstructed.You can easily use the tablet in the portrait mode by folding the cover back like a book.  The landscape mode, for watching movies, surfing the internet, etc. offers four slotted viewing positions...but you can really bypass these and put it at any angle you choose.  There is enough friction to hold the tablet in place no matter how you slant it, although the slots provided do add further stability (better, for example, for a bumpy airplane ride).The stripe on the cover is merely decorative (when viewing the photo I thought it might be a strap to hold the cover shut....it's not). I think it does give the case a nice touch of style.  The cover also has a soft, felt-like material on the inside to protect the screen, and the look and feel of the outside material is certainly not disappointing.  It is soft to the touch, and has a fairly rich feel to it.The case has a magnetic closure, and it does wake the tablet up when you open it and puts it to sleep when you close it.  Thus far, this has worked perfectly for me.  It fits against the tablet completely flat and secure...no warps or open areas.My only real area of negativity is the price.  As of this writing, it is selling for around $70, which I think is excessive.  I was fortunate enough to get it via the Vine program; I would not have shelled out $70 for it by any means.  I think it is worth more around the $30 to $40 range. I did not lower my rating for that reason though, since IMO the quality is excellent, the features are everything I would look for, and prices do tend to fluctuate.If things change as I use it more, I will update this review.  If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will try to answer.Thanks for reading and I hope this helps you in your buying decision!","rating":5},{"comment":"I carry my tablet with me everywhere and use it a lot thereby, the case is very important to me. I love it the Belkin Folio Case. Sleek, stylish and convenient. This case fits like a glove. Not bulky and super light weight. I couldn't ask for better.","rating":5},{"comment":"This case is very nice.  If you're looking for a professional looking case, this is it.  The cover is made from a suede-like fabric that is washable.  The box that it comes in is open so you can see exactly what the case looks and feels like, but there's no plastic to cover it.  Mine had greasy finger prints on it.  It looked like someone was snacking on chips while stocking.  I used a damp cloth to scrub the grease off, then buffed it with a soft chamois cloth.  It looks perfect now.  I can't even tell there were ever prints on it.Inside there's a plastic stand that you put your tablet into.  However, the case does not fold easily to obtain the various angles it shows on the back of the box. It is very easy to position in the other direction, like that shown on the front.There a magnetic closure that wakes when opened.","rating":4},{"comment":"If you need a case for a kid's tablet or for someone with butterfingers, Belkin's smooth tri-fold folio case for Samsung Galaxy Tab Pro probably isn't a good idea. Though superior in construction, the case is good and skinny, which is great if you are in the market for light weightiness, but a drawback if chances are the tablet will be banged around or dropped hard. The soft-lined case, however, is more than adequate if you are looking to prevent scratches and minor mishaps. Good too, is that the case fits my tablet like a glove, so there shouldn't be any tab fumbles. Plus the opening in the case precisely fits the camera and the stylus, so there's no added guesswork or room for added scuffles, when it comes to using those features.What I think really makes the case distinct is the simple but nice look.  In fact, my first impression was summed up in one word, \"Nice!\" The purple color is not only super attractive, but also easy to find, especially if the tablet always seems to be on route all over the house--like mine!Nice too is the folding, versatile cover that allows a multiple table view from a variety of angles as well as a comfortable typing position, plus the tablet secures well in place.Considering the strong points, Belkin's smooth tri-fold folio case is a good bang for the buck as long as you don't bang the contents too hard!Stacy Lytwyn, Marketing Guru\/Motivational Speaker\/JournalistAuthor: CONSUMMATE CONNECTICUT: DAY TRIPS WITH PANACHEAce Blogger: WTF: Where's the Faith, wtfwheresthefaith.wordpress.com","rating":4},{"comment":"This case fits the Galaxy Tab Pro 10.1 inch as a glove.

Provides good protection for the tablet and the case itself seems to hold up well also.  Magnetic closure and multiple viewing angles are both nice features.The only potential negative is that this case is slightly bulkier than some others, but personally I think it is worth it for the extra protection it provides. Given that the 12&#34; tablets are pretty heavy, the added protective border on this case seems necessary to prevent the tablet from breaking if it is dropped.","rating":5},{"comment":"Love the vibrant color, only this would not fit my Samsung Galaxy Note should have noted that this was for the Galaxy Tab Pro, but very nice item.","rating":4},{"comment":"I rated Belkin Cinema stripe folio 4 stars because it is an adequate cover for Samsung Gala6 Note. Initially when it first arrived, it felt cheap and I didn't like the overall feel of the product. Some of my other Belkin cases are built better.Although I like the Magnetic closure, I would prefer an extra tab or elastic band closure for added protection when kids handle the Samsung.Overall, this is a fine cover but not sturdy enough for young kids handling it. This Cinema stripe folio is not my favorite and look forward to the next replacement.","rating":4},{"comment":"I've had the chance to try out a lot of speakers in this price range.  This one is above any of the others I've tried so far.I like this one and will be using it a lot, unlike the rest of the small inexpensive Bluetooth speakers I've tried and here are the reasons:* A pleasant voice tells you when the Bluetooth is connected and when the speaker is turned on and off.  I find this very helpful.* This has greater volume and better sound than any of the others.*This is better looking than any of the others.*This holds a charge longer than the others.*This is easier to connect to Bluetooth than any of the others.Most of these small inexpensive Bluetooth speakers are not worth bothering with.  This one stands out above the rest for the above reasons.  It won't rival a $300 Bluetooth speaker, but for the price this one is definitely a lot better than most of the others like it I've tried.  This is the one I would recommend for anyone looking for a small inexpensive Bluetooth Speaker, out of the hundreds that are available.[Sample provided.]","rating":5},{"comment":"The Mocreo Mosound Speaker is a nice, good-looking and capable speaker for your computer, phone, e-book device, or anything else that allows you to connect through a wire or Bluetooth. And, as it is wireless, it's an easy speaker unit to accompany you at the beach, picnic spot, campground, or any other place you'd like to hear projected sound almost effortlessly.Where it does its best is how easy it is to connect...in almost no time I had it Bluetooth connected and playing. It was a breeze. Though it has its eccentricities when it comes to connecting it to my other devices through wires (two are supplied), these were relatively simple, too...more on that in a second.The sound is good for a small speaker unit...about what you'd expect from the two small-ish stereo speakers contained within. While the sound is fine, I would not expect it to be able to \"blast\" sound without a lot of distortion or, worse yet, damage to its speakers.As to bass and treble, one would not expect great sound at the upper and especially lower ends of the aural spectrum, but it certainly works decently at the middle, more typical portion. Where sound becomes tinny or \"drops out\" is at the extremes, especially the lower end. But Mocreo is to be credited here: whereas the human ear is able to hear 20Hz at the lower, bass end, all the way to 20,000 Hz at the upper, treble end, this speaker is claimed to be capable of producing sound from 120 Hz to 18,000. In other words, Mocreo states from the start that the extremes are not to be expected. That's honesty, and it's why I'm giving it five stars.As for those connectors, as well as doing almost anything else important with this speaker (like connecting, charging the battery, or turning it on and off, or changing methods of connecting--like using wires vs. Bluetooth) it's important to wait for the device's (decidedly Asian and female) voice to command you and\/or signal the change.For instance, when I first tried to turn the device on and then connect the wires to my laptop--which is not Bluetooth--I ran into trouble: nothing worked. What had happened was that I had \"confused\" the issue: trying too much at one time. When I tried things step my step, letting the speaker \"inform\" me of each change, things went fine.The speaker will tell you when it is turned on, and will also inform you when the connection is Bluetooth, or if you are using a wire connection, and so on. The instructions also help in this regard. NOTE: I did have to turn off my Kindle to use my Samsung's Bluetooth phone connection. My phone would neither connect nor recognize the speaker until my Kindle was completely turned off (or, I suppose, removed to a room far enough away from the speaker), at which point it did fine.Once the speaker is place so that the + and - signs are showing on the top, its little rubber feet will supply enough soft friction that it will be difficult to move it. This is most likely good enough to keep it stable in most situations, but I would not expect it to stay in one place, say, on the console of a boat bouncing on waves, or other situations where greater stability is required.But this brings up one of its most important features: it's IPx4 waterproof , which means it's protected against splashing and spraying water from all sides--certainly capable of bringing it to the beach and surviving the day.NOTE: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.","rating":5},{"comment":"The sound on this unit is pretty good. Not as good as my battery powered Bose unit, but then again the Bose cost almost $200 more. We use this for outdoor gatherings with some friends and the volume is adequate enough to clearly hear the music and still enjoy conversation.The unit pairs quickly with an IPhone and has buttons for volume control and previous and next song. I like the fact that it has a microphone to allow use for incoming or outgoing phone calls. The phone sound quality is very good and there is no feedback like some of the cheaper phone\/speakerphone units. I tested it out at work for a conference call and it was more than adequate for that purpose.","rating":4},{"comment":".- - - Audio Delay Spoils Video - - -This speaker has a 0.48 second audio delay, which is not good for watching movies, TV, YouTube, or any type of video. Lips and words are too far removed. Most Bluetooth speakers and headphones I've tested have a .08 to .13 second delay, which your brain will find acceptable when watching video (see Note 1).- - - The Sound - - -I'm not a sound geek, but I notice good and bad sound. I listened to two challenging tunes and a podcast on this and 4 other small speakers many times over.Mocreo's top bullet, \"superior bass performance for those low tones that help ensure rich, high-quality sound\" is misleading. The sound in the upper-mid range and highs is very good, but rich lower tones are about like other speakers of this size. Bass and lower-mid range is less prominent than on the $19 to $25PLEMO Magic Cube, for example (or its many clones...search Bluetooth Magic Cube on amazon). I'm talking about the warmth you hope for when listening to violins or a male voice on a podcast.The sound is way better than my laptop speakers (MacBook Pro 13\" Retina 2012), and it's even a notch warmer than our 24\" iMac speakers (circa 2009).PROs:- Nice upper-mid and high range stereo sound- Very nice build quality...appearance, ruggedness, fit and finish.- Volume is very impressive (see Note 2)- Works for phone calls- Water resistant- 3.5mm jack for wired input- MicroSD card slot (aka TF card slot) (did not test)- Thoughtful details, like a well positioned hole for hanging the speaker on a cord.OKs:- Voice announcement of \"Bluetooth connected,\" etc. (Could be annoying -- See Note 3.)- Dual function + and - buttons (must hold buttons to adjust volume...could be annoying)- Bluetooth pairing and range are flawless- User Guide is very clear and helpful- Note that speakers are 45mm with 3-inches of separation- Warranty: 1 yearCONs:* Audio delay (0.48 sec) is way more than other Bluetooth speakers.

I believe my review is impartial.- - - Notes - - -Note 1: Audio Delay - All tested speakers have zero delay when connected with a cable. There are YouTube videos which help you see and measure audio delay. Search \"audio sync test.\"Note 2: Volume - Max volume works nicely in a large living room, even with some voices and distractions. It even works outdoors quite well. It's louder than thePLEMO Magic Cube. Impressive. From your computer, remember to check both your system volume and the app (for example, iTunes) volume.Note 3: Voice announcement is a good idea. You might find Mocreo's version kind of tacky. \"Hi, I'm ready...waiting for a connection\" is in an accented Asian voice. \"Bluetooth connected\" is in an American voice, and \"power off\" is chopped: \"..ower off.\"~~~ Comments & questions welcome ~~~","rating":3},{"comment":"This Bluetooth speaker comes with USB charging cable, 3.5 mm audio cable and user manual. I have had the pleasure of testing this speaker and really getting some use out of it. Now this is a well designed Bluetooth speaker and it has so many good things about it that I don't know where to start. First of all this Bluetooth speaker is small in size but has an awesome sound quality to it. It can play pretty loud for it's size as well. The vocals are crisp and clear and it's very enjoyable to listen to my favorite music with this speaker. It sounds the absolute best from the front of the speaker but it sounds good from any angle.This speaker is rechargeable so there is no wasting money on expensive alkaline batteries. When the battery is fully depleted it will take about four hours to charge and you will get about six hours of play time on a full charge. It has a blue light on the left that indicates when it's on and it will remind you to turn it off when you are finished listening to music.On the top you will find a large plus and minus button that is used to move forward and back through tracks. You can stream music from any Bluetooth enabled device is you can insert a TF memory card and play directly from it. If you look around you can find TF memory card for very low cost. You can use a TF memory card up to 16 GB in size. I have tested both ways and it works perfectly. I had no problem syncing this speaker to my iPad for streaming music or syncing it to my phone for making calls. Yes this speaker has a microphone and can be used for making hands free calls. I'm telling you they thought of everything with this speaker. Calls are clear as long as you have good cell reception.I love the exterior of this speaker. The front and back are a metal mesh that is painted black it looks nice and provides a strong layer of protection for the speaker. The top, bottom and sides all have the feel of soft silicone. It's super smooth and feels great to the touch. It has two big feet on the bottom to make it stable with setting on a table. On one side you will find a power button, and a play\/pause\/call button. Below that you will find a USB port, Aux 3.5 mm audio input and a place to insert your TF memory card. There is a silicone cover that snaps in place over these inputs. In fact the entire speaker is waterproof which is pretty sweet. I don't know if I would take it to the bottom of the pool but it is totally capable of withstanding a hard rain.If you are looking for the perfect Bluetooth speaker than it really doesn't get much better than this in my opinion. The combination of great sound quality, features and price make this speaker an incredible value.Sample provided for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a really nice Bluetooth speaker.

As an audio snob I have tried out a bunch of similar products and usually they come up short with too little volume, absolutely no bass or are lacking in clarity.  This little speaker does an excellent job of projecting both loud and clear sound with an acceptable amount of bass for such a small enclosure.The first thing I did after I fully charged the unit was pick up my phone and open up the Amazon Prime Music app and stream a few songs to the device as it sat on my desk.  I was very impressed with the quality of the sound and the ability to control the volume from either my iPhone or the device itself.The device is well built and sturdy and the rubberized feet on the bottom really do keep the speaker in place even at full volume.  This may not sound like a big deal but I have had portable speakers walk themselves right off the desk so it is definitely a plus to have that stability.Where I've found I really like this device is pairing it with my laptop to watch streaming video, especially when exercising.  The volume and clarity of this device are better than the speakers in my old MacBook Pro and I can hear it clearly over the noise the bike or treadmill make.  One thing for watching videos, if you use the bluetooth connection you may lose synch and you'll notice that the audio and what you're seeing on the screen don't exactly match up.  Using the included audio cable corrected that issue so I am happy.I am pleased with the batter life as the unit lasts at least the six hours that the manufacturer claims and even longer for me, perhaps because I'm using it wired and not using the bluetooth.The bottom line is this is a good sounding speaker that works equally well for music and for television \/ movies and talk radio applications.

This thing seems pretty solidly built (rugged) even though it's small- I liked the +\/- button which you can use to skip songs- Very Easy to sync. I synced it with a few different things including my tablet, laptop and mobile phone (S4).CONS:- I would've liked there to be a Volume UP\/Down  Physical Button on the speaker.  I found myself wanting to adjust the volume on the speaker itself (in the shower)  but you have to adjust on the item to which it has synced to.Conclusion :Overall, I really like this Mobile Bluetooth (water-proof) speaker system. It sounds great, it's portable, and it's built very well. It has so many great things going for it that I would happily recommend it to anyone looking for a system like this.

I like the stylish, over-sized buttons, which make controlling it a breeze compared to other Bluetooth speakers I have whose buttons are much smaller and harder to push. Out of the three colors, I'd definitely go with the black or red (which is mostly black) because the white gets dirty easily and even out of the box I don't think it looks as nice.Overall, this is a great option if you want to bring your sounds on the go. And, because it's water resistant, you can bring it in areas that might get a splash here and there, like the beach or pool.","rating":5},{"comment":"It is hard to hear the stereo sound in this two-speakers-in-one-unit MOSOUND Bar. But, putting aside the lack of stereo, the sound that comes through is rich and well-balanced. The bass is adequate. The balanced sound is detailed, full and articulate. I'm plenty happy with the way my music comes through! I do prefer a true stereo effect, though, and I really don't hear that in this speaker.BT range is adequate, but not the longest range I have seen in this price range. I am getting about 40-45 feet, before the BT disconnects. It does not sputter and skip when too far away from the device, like other BT speakers I've tried. This one actually disconnects, then re-connects when you walk it back into range.The battery will definitely get you through 6 hours, and in most cases that is long enough. Then re-charging is about half that time.I don't really like that the volume buttons are also the forward\/back buttons. I find it difficult to hit the button for just the right short amount of time so that I turn down\/up the volume slightly, and don't backtrack or go forward. In other words: It is a very, very fine tune to get the slight volume change instead of changing tracks.It does have a mic, where some other speakers in this price range do not. So, its almost a toss up: In my mind there are a variety of 3.5- to 4-star BT speakers: You get some features that you like, compromise on others. I love a true stereo sound, but I like the bass and fullness of this speaker. I don't like the doubling-up of the control buttons, and I don't need a mic. I'd like to show a 3.5 star rating on this speaker, but it's rounded up to a four.*I received a sample product from MOCREO.","rating":4},{"comment":"It's been a pleasure using and evaluating the MOCREO MOSOUND Bar.

This is really handy because I don't need to fumble around when playing music to take calls. The battery lasted about 7 hours consistently in 3 different tries. Something that is important to be said here when purchasing these speakers and having expectations about play time is that the louder you use the speaker, the more battery it takes. My 7 hours is at mid\/medium volume. If I were to play it at top volume I suspect it would last in the 4.5 to 5 hour range. That is a guess as I do not enjoy my music that loud. The unit fully charges in about 3 hours. You can, of course, charge while still using the unit.This is a great unit that is also water resistant. It has very secure rubber placement over the ports and is all around very sturdy.  I highly recommend.","rating":5},{"comment":"Very good sound quality. I own at least five Bluetooth speakers and this ranks among the best-- with the bonus that it's waterproof (well, splash resistant, really). I have yet to find one of these speakers that actually works properly for phone calls, however. I got all excited because at first, it seemed that this one would. I called my aunt and she said she could hear me clearly and I could hear her clearly... for about a minute. Then she went silent. I spent 10 seconds or so going, &#34;Hello? Are you there?&#34; Then she came back. Then she cut out. Then she came back. Volume was inconsistent and sometimes nonexistent.So my search continues for a speaker that really functions properly as a speakerphone as well, but for music purposes, this is a powerful speaker with good bass that's plenty adequate for home and backyard\/beach environments.","rating":4},{"comment":"The Mocreo Mosound bluetooth speaker is my fourth portable bluetooth speaker, all in the $40 price range. The other bluetooth speakers, Sabrent SP-BYTA, Ivation Bullet, and AYL BSPR300, provide a good comparison when examining build quality, sound, and functionality. The Mosound fits in nicely with those other bluetooth speakers. There are aspects of the Mosound that shine, like the build quality and IPx4 waterproof certification, and other aspects, like the noise level from the speakers and microphone quality, which disappoint.FEATURES \/ IPX4 CERTIFICATIONThe Mosound features an internal Li-ion rechargeable battery, a pair of 45mm speakers, 3.5W x2 of power, and a frequency response of 120Hz-18kHz. Music can be played by connecting a device via bluetooth, a 3.5mm audio cable, and microSD card up to 16GB. Perhaps the best feature is the Mosound's IPx4 certification, meaning it is splash resistant. It has been splashed from all angles for at least 5 minutes at water pressure of 80-100 kN\/m2. Basically, it can be rained on but if you drop it in a stream there is a good chance the speaker will be permanently damaged. It is perfect for the shower which is where I use it.SOUND:The sound quality is appropriate for a bluetooth speaker at its price with the exception of the amount of noise that comes out of the Mosound even at very low volumes. The Mosound has very good mids and highs but is lacking a bit in bass. Given its size, I was expecting a little better bass. The bass is not as good as the similarly sized Sabrent or AYL speakers.The worst thing about the sound though is the amount of noise that comes through the speakers at all volume levels. The noise is clearly audible from a few feet away and makes listening to music at low volumes undesirable. The noise is audible whenever the Mosound is receiving an audio signal. If not receiving any audio signal after a couple seconds, the Mosound turns off the speakers and the noise stops.PLAY TIME AND CHARGE TIME TESTS:Upon receiving the Mosound I fully charged it and then began playing music to test how much play time a full charge provided. On the box it states up to 6 hours of play time at medium volume. Having tested the other bluetooth speakers, I thought the estimate was likely low. At medium volume the Mosound provided almost exactly 16 hours of play time before the battery died and the speaker shut off.The instruction manual states a full charge takes about 4 hours. With a completely dead battery, I fully charged the Mosound. It took 3 hours and 45 minutes to fully charge. This means the Mosound has a play time to charge ratio of 4.27 to 1. This is on the lower end of the other bluetooth speakers I've tested. Still, I'm happy with the 16 hours of play time on a full charge the Mosound provides.BLUETOOTH RANGE TESTED:The specifications state a bluetooth range of 10 meters (32.8'). Playing music from my iPhone with line of sight of the Mosound so the signal wasn't going through any walls or objects, the range at which I didn't experience any connectivity problems when within was 35'. Beyond 35', the music would increasing cut out the closer I got to 50'. Beyond 50', the music would constantly cut out.BUILD:The Mosound features a metal grill on the front and back, plastic sides, and rubberized top and bottom. The rubberized bottom and feet give the Mosound a nice grip even on wet surfaces. Using the speaker in the shower I haven't experienced it slipping around when pushing the volume\/next\/previous buttons on the top. Of the bluetooth speakers I have, the Mosound by far has the best build quality and is the most attractively designed. It is a very cool looking bluetooth speaker!PROS:1. Build quality and attractively designed.2. IPx4 waterproof certification making it perfect for the shower.3. 16 hours of play time at medium volume on a full charge from my test.4. Rubberized feet keep it from slipping on surfaces.5. Can play music from microSD cards up to 16GB.NEUTRAL:1. I find the voice notifications increasing annoying but will put it in neutral since some people may like them. When you turn on the speaker it says, \"Hi, I'm ready. Waiting for connection.\" After it connects to the device it then says, \"Bluetooth connected.\" When turning off it says, \"Power off.\" The voice notifications are very loud and at the same loudness regardless of the volume level you are listening to music. This is bad if listening to music at low volumes so as not to disturb others. At some point, like when turning the speaker on and off, the speaker is going to blast out a voice notification. Worst part, you can't turn the voice notifications off. The first couple of times using the Mosound the voice notifications are handy but after using the Mosound a few times the notifications to me become completely unnecessary and an annoyance.CONS:1. Noise clearly audible from a few feet away at all volume levels. Makes listening to music at low volumes undesirable.2. Microphone on Mosound functions very poorly making it unusable. If I talk to someone through the microphone they say my voice continually goes loud\/soft\/loud\/soft. I even tried recording a voice memo using the microphone on the Mosound and it sounded like my voice was constantly cutting out. When talking into the microphone, I'm within 12-18\" of the Mosound so distance isn't the issue.3. Volume and Previous\/Next Track should have separate buttons. \"+\" button for previous track or long press for volume increase. \"-\" for next track or long press for volume decrease. The volume on the Mosound is incremental and doesn't have a lot of increments. It makes fine tuning the volume on the Mosound difficult without going to the next or previous track. I end up having to use a combination of volume on the Mosound and device to get it right. Even after a long press either increasing or decreasing volume the Mosound will commonly go to the previous or next track anyway.SUMMARY:There are aspects of the Mosound that shine like its build quality, styling, IPx4 waterproof certification, and 16 hours of play time on a full charge. If you buy the Mosound, do so for those reasons. However, there are things with the Mosound which should be better like the microphone and amount of noise coming out of the speakers even at very low volumes. I understand that the voice notifications may be a personal preference but I find them annoying and wish there was at least an option provided to turn them off. The Mosound would also be better if Volume and Previous\/Next Track had separate buttons, however, if you typically keep the speaker at the same volume you will likely not be bothered by this. In spite of its deficiencies I still like the Mosound and feel it deserves 4 stars. It is perfect for the shower!Note: A product sample was provided by the seller in exchange for a fair, unbiased review.","rating":4},{"comment":"I've listened to a lot of Bluetooth speakers and this is probably one of the best I've listened to. When it comes to sound all things being equal, the bigger the speakers and more of them you have the better. In this case, this speaker bar has 2 speakers and the sound is very decent indeed. A sample product was provided for review purposes.The other things that I like about this speaker bar include:- Water resistance, no need to worry about getting water on it. It will make a very good poolside or bathroom speaker.- Pairing was very easy. Also has speaker phone function.- Has TF card function so you don't need other audio device to play music.- Bluetooth or other MP3 player with 3.5mm audio jack.- Great design.Overall, an excellent speaker bar with good sound.","rating":5},{"comment":"The water-resistance and build quality are key selling points for this Mocreo Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker. While the limits of my laptop drive at the moment prevent a updated Bluetooth drive from installing and syncing (I've tried!), with the 3.5 mm mini cord if of standard mini length provided, it works fine. It charges easily on a red light and turns to blue when charged. Simple to set up and get going.The booklet tells what you need to know, and the best feature not found in other speakers I have been asked to try out is the TF\/micro card slot up to 16 mb. This is behind a rubber panel with the audio jack and the charger port. Like any such product, the door must be used with care as it is attached by only one connection to the housing, but it protects it from the elements. Likewise, the housing is tough. It has been knocked over already a few times and it holds up well. It is rubber and easily gripped.A small hole allows this to be hooked to another cord, while the large +\/- signs work for volume. There is also a speakerphone option I have not been able to test out. It rests on small legs but can be tilted up on its side, a useful design. A Bluetooth and power buttons on the side. The most notable feature is its voice: it turns on, informs you of the syncing in progress, and then tells you in a throaty Asian accented English &#34;enjoy [ox?] music&#34;; it also shuts off when not in use for a short time, a wise addition.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have tried many different Bluetooth speakers and can definitely give my approval on this one. It usually seems a little trickier to find one of these that supports Bluetooth for better Android compatibility that isn't solely compatible with Apple devices.Pros:[+] Love that it has a built-in rechargeable battery. My other Bluetooth speakers around the house have to be next to an outlet.[+] Compact and very easy to move around the house.[+] I don't usually listen to anything for more than an hour or so at a time, but the battery seems to last a pretty decent amount of time before needing to be recharged.[+] Very easy to recharge, just uses a standard micro USB cable that I already have 999 of in addition to the one included with the product.[+] Seemed to hold up just fine in the shower, so while I didn't try (and don't recommend) immersing it in water, it does seem to be resilient to light splashing.[+] While not the best audio in the world, I am very surprised at the quality it has for how small and light it is.Cons:[-] The voice. I'd much rather it just give me a quick beep or bloop to communicate. It's comical but also gets annoying very quick having to hear the woman say \"Hi, I'm ready, waiting for a connection\" in a thick Asian accent. But then right after, you'll hear \"Bluetooth connected\" in a different woman's American accent. It's all kind of strange, and I don't think any voice output is really necessary.[-] If you are very close to the speaker, there is a small amount of white noise at any given time regardless of my phone's volume or the unit's volume. Not noticeable from more than a few feet away, but it did make it hard to use with it right next to my bed. I ended up moving it into the kitchen where I haven't noticed that problem anymore.So other than a couple minor complaints, it's a very fun and capable device that is very easy to pick up and travel with.

It has a humorous voice that comes on and says, &#34;Hey, I'm ready, waiting for a connection.&#34; It makes me smile every time. It works great with my smartphone but can also connect to any MP3 device using an audio cable. It charges using the USB to micro USB cable (provided) and holds the charge for quite awhile.The sound is great. Solid, clear, and loud enough. There are big volume buttons on the top that also act as forward\/backward track controls. It can be used as a call receiver as well.

It has two 3.5 W drivers for clear and loud stereo sound.  The 1,400 mAh battery provides six hours of listening at reasonable volumes and recharges in about four hours by USB cable, which is included.The Bluetooth pairing is quite painless or there is an audio cable with 3.5 mm plugs included for a wired connection.

That means you can take it anywhere without fear of ruining it with water.  It is not completely waterproof meaning, do not immerse it in water, but you can use it in the shower with a full blast of water going on.The sound coming from the twin stereo speakers is surprisingly good for its small size (it's about 2.5&#34; X 2.5&#34; X 7&#34;) and weighs a little over a pound (just enough to keep it in place with its silicone base for non-slip).The dimpled screen speaker cover is attractive and the top has BIG red PLUS and NEGATIVE signs that make it easy to control the volume and\/or cut to the next song or the previous song.On the side is s tight fitting rubber cover that hides three features.  One is the Micro USB port used for charging (a charging cord with a Micro USB on one end and a regular USB on the other comes with the speaker).  Another is a 3.5mm input plug for other sources of music than your Bluetooth device (note that this will make your unit more susceptible to water as the rubber cover will need to be open).  The other hidden port is for a TF Card, so you can play music without Bluetooth or the 3.5mm plug.  You are covered on three fronts.It takes (when it first arrives) about two hours to fully charge and will last up to six hours (this depends on how loud you play the music).  The sound is truly good.  For its size it produces a good clean treble, a firm mid-range and a solid (but not too heavy) a bass.  It&#8217;s a three-way balanced sound without distortion even at the loudest volume attainable.  The price is very comparable to most Bluetooth speakers in this range and for the aesthetics and sound, along with the extra little features; this is one competitive Bluetooth speaker.","rating":5},{"comment":"Compact size but big sound, the speaker measures approximately seven inches long, two and a half inches wide, two and a half inches tall and weighs 82 of a pound. Included with the speaker are a clearly written User Guide and a twenty-two inch USB-A to USB micro cable for charging the speaker. A twelve inch cable with 3.5mm plugs on both ends can be used to directly connect the speaker to a device (MP3 player, laptop, iPod, iPad, etc.) and there is also a slot on the side of the unit to plug in a maximum 16 GB micro SDHC or TF card to play music, both of these options can be used without enabling the Bluetooth capabilities.To operate the speaker press the power button and a disembodied voice states \"power on\" and press again and the same voice announces \"power off.\" When the cable is plugged in for charging the lithium battery, the same voice announces \"charging\" and a steady red light appears. The light disappears when the unit is fully charged and the voice announces \"charge complete.\" Charging from fully depleted takes four hours and fully charged the speaker will play for six hours at medium volume.Pairing with a Bluetooth enabled device presented no issues. Maximum transmission distance between the speaker and music device is 32 feet. The built in microphone and call answer button permits the music to be paused, so incoming call from the paired phone may be answered.  Press again to resume the music. A large plus and minus sign serve a dual purpose with a quick press mirroring whatever app is being used, for previous or next, and with a long press as volume adjustments. A sound indicates when maximum volume is reached.IPX water resistance levels are assigned to outdoor equipment and range from IPX 0 - no water resistance - to IPX 8 - submergible. This device has a IPX 4 water resistance classification so the speaker can be splashed with water for five minutes without damage.I encountered absolutely no problems with this speaker, it is straightforward to operate and the sound at maximum volume is distortion-free and well balanced without any range overwhelming the others.

What I will do is provide some reasons why I awarded this five stars. I received mine as a review sample, which I normally donate after evaluating. This one so impressed me that it's a keeper.The main thing I love is the sound. This one is a bit biased towards the low end, but does an excellent job with the high and mid range frequencies too. It passed my critical listening test by faithfully reproducing every note and nuance of Miles Davis'Kind Of Blue.It's also loud. Most speakers in this price range are made for nearby listening (desk, nightstand, etc.) This can be heard across a room. It can actually be heard from over thirty feet away when I was testing the bluetooth streaming limit. It passed that test, too, by the way, by streaming music crystal clear with no breaking up or hiccups.Ease of use is superb. As soon as you power it up it announces (in a female voice) that it is ready to pair. Do a scan from your phone or tablet and it shows up. Pair, connect and play. Beats the old style bluetooth speakers where you had to hold down a button for a specific number of seconds and pray.Another thing I love is it's sturdy. At my age I tend to drop things more than I care to admit, and this sustained a fall from waist high with no problem. Plus it's waterproof. I tested it in the shower and not only did it work, but it was loud enough to cut through the water noise. That is impressive in itself.For me this is perfect because I can take it practically anywhere and not worry about it. But the sound is the thing and that is why I am keeping it.","rating":5},{"comment":"I've tried lots of bluetooth speakers, and for the size this one is pretty good.It packs more sound than I'd expect for its size.

Turn it on and a voice will say its ready to pair, then go into your bluetooth settings and select the \"mosound bar\" device, and it will say that it's connected. Then play your music as you like and it booms through the speaker.You can add a micro SD card with songs on it. I haven't bothered to try that, since I really only use this to stream music from my phone.It takes several hours to charge and their claim that the battery lasts 6 hours seems about right to me.If you get a call while you're listening to music from your phone, the music pauses to let you take the call.It's a good, weatherproof, rugged and portable way to deliver sound wherever you like.

The packaging is very attractive, efficient, and by it's precise sizing very environmentally friendly.  Included in the package is the speaker, detailed easy to understand instructions,  a USB charging cable and a 3.5mm male to male plug for connecting your tablet or phone directly to the speaker.The speaker itself is very well constructed with a combination of a metal grill, hard plastic, rubberized feeling sides and bottom.  The design is sleek in black with red and white accents.  The speaker feels substantial, yet will easily fit in a pocketbook or backpack.Using the enclosed instructions, I had the speaker working with my Bluetooth enabled laptop in less than 2 minutes.  The sound was loud, clear with surprisingly deep bass for such a small speaker system, even making the Mocreo vibrate a bit from the bass.  The volume can be adjusted from the large red + and - signs on the top of the speaker.I also tested the speaker by linking it with my Bluetooth enabled phone, and it was easy to do, and worked perfectly.  The speaker has a microphone, so hands free phone calls are possible and perhaps would work well in a car.The Mocreo speaker has a rechargeable lithium battery, charged by USB, so purchasing replaceable batteries are not necessary.  I really enjoyed the voice announcements, which are in a pleasant female voice when turned on or connected to Bluetooth.  Just an extra touch making the speaker a little more special.Bluetooth speakers are available for as little as $5.00 and as much as $200+.  At this price point, this high quality Mocreo speaker is well worth the money.","rating":5},{"comment":"I received one of these to test and review.  The size and rugged feel impressed me off the bat.  For a waterproof speaker intended for outdoor use, this is a good choice.  There are a lot of features for the price.  Some notes:** Audio Quality **I use this primarily for streaming Spotify music.  I tried it on a Google Nexus 7 and on an iPhone 4S.  On both, the music quality was decent.  Not great.  Just decent.  From the moment the speaker is turned on, there is a quiet hiss that doesn't go away when the music is playing, but becomes much less noticeable when music plays a little louder.  It's not enough to bother me, but I do notice it.  For a small get-together outdoors, this provides decent audio quality.** Connectivity **When I first turned the speaker on, a friendly voice from the speaker said it was &#34;ready to connect&#34;.  I had absolutely no trouble connecting to my iPhone or Nexus 7.  There were times I used it with the Nexus 7 when the audio would drop out for a second or so.  It immediately came back each time. I'm not sure what the cause was.  The Nexus and the speaker were just a couple inches from each other.  Is this a connectivity issue?** Using it for phone calls **When using this to answer phone calls, I found that I need to stand quite close to the speaker when talking.  When I stand on one side of my kitchen, with the speaker on the other side, the caller has trouble hearing me when I speak in a normal conversational tone.  I do like the convenience of being able to handle calls with this speaker, but I just have to get used to being right next to it.** Functionality **I like the oversized buttons on the top.  It's interesting that the same buttons are used both for volume control and for skipping songs.  This took some getting used to.  A couple times, when I wanted to increase the volume, I accidentally pressed the big &#34;+&#34; button a few times to increase the volume a few notches.  But that's not how the button works...instead of increasing the volume, it skipped 3 tracks ahead on my Spotify playlist.  The solution?  Hold down the big &#34;+&#34; button when I want to change the volume.Note also that MOCREO says this comes with &#34;TF card&#34; support.  This is equivalent to &#34;Micro SD&#34; support.  There is a card slot which, I suppose, could be used if you had a card full of songs.  Then, you could listen to music without needing to connect to a separate device.All in all, for the price, this is a good speaker.  If it cost much more, I would expect a bit more in terms of audio quality.  But it is easy to recommend if you are looking for an outdoor speaker at a reasonable price.","rating":4},{"comment":"The Mocreo speaker is one nice speaker.

There are other brands with what seems to be an identical speaker.  This Mocreo stands out because it offers the speaker in multiple color choices, it also has it name badge on the speaker grill.  The only major knock of this type of speaker, is it takes longer to charge and the sound doesnt get much louder than single speaker designs I have tested.

A pleasant female voice announces Bluetooth or Aux connection, implied disconnection (\"Hi, I'm ready for a connection.\"), or auto \"Power off\". The device also accepts a 16GB TF\/Micro-USB card for playing music without Bluetooth.

Both activities involved a garden hose and the possibility of inadvertent splashes, or a watery mist.  It worked and sounded great.Then I thought, hey - IPX4 rating (the description also states IP54 rating - whatever that is.)  This standard states &#34;Water splashing against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effect.&#34;  So I took it in the shower and put it in the corner shelf.  The most water it would receive here is the occasional splash.It died.  The volume became erratic, music started skipping and it started making a popping sound.An hour later it started making a loud (full volume) popping sound. I had to put it in the garage.  Eventually the battery drained. I'm waiting a few days before I try and charge it again. When I opened the rubber gasket that covers the ports, water came out.  For IPX4 that should not have happened.So, on the deck or a drizzle - it's fine. In the shower - nope. I don't know why they picture it sitting in a puddle - that would kill it.It has decent bass, nice separation (I keep it perpendicular so I have decent stereo.) For example, in bed at night I don't have the speakers facing me - they point left and right. It sounds fantastic. You only need the volume at around 10%!I'll update the review in a few days after I see if it can be revived after the shower.","rating":4},{"comment":"I had tried another MOCREO product before and was very impressed, so when offered to review this speaker for a honest review, I jumped on it. As per my expectations, this speaker far exceeded. The moment you take this out, the rugged rubberized design makes it pop out. I see this as great for outdoor parties, camping, driving as well as bathroom use while shaving\/brushing teeth and so on. Setup is very wasy with Bluetooth pairing. The sound is great and I definitely loved it.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a really nice speaker. It is just the right size for taking with you but big enough to produce a nice loud sound. It is clear and I had no noise when I had the bass up on my phone. The sound for answering or placing a phone call was clear for both me and the caller. I have speakers that cost twice what this one does that do not sound as good as this one. It is a good looking speaker too. I love the large buttons on the top. They are very easy to see or feel. I love that it remembers my phone and reconnects when I turn it on. I was able to get over 80 feet away from the speaker before the sound started to falter. The real kicker is that it is waterproof. I love being able to control it without worrying that my hands are wet or that the kids have their drinks beside it. All in all it is a great quality for the cost. I received this product for a fair and honest review.","rating":5},{"comment":"Mocreo is proving itself in the new, and ever-expanding field of audio electronics. This wireless waterproof portable speaker is a good example of the high quality and constantly improving line-up of Mocreo products.It is a brick-shaped, sturdy and compact unit, 18 cm x 6.8cm x 6.8cm (7.1&#8221; x 2.7&#8221; x 2.7&#8221;). Easily portable at 375 grams (0.82 lbs). Nicely built, rugged elegant design and finish. Has two non-slip rubberized bands on the bottom. Large + and - volume touch buttons with a mike plug in between. A slot for MicroSD\/TF card, a micro USB port and a 3.5mm Auxiliary &#34;in&#34; jack, all protected under a silicone cover strip. A clearly marked &#8220;Play\/Pause\/Receive a call&#8221; and a &#8220;Power&#8221; button are on the same side of the device. A hole in a corner is provided for hanging the device (in the shower?)A USB-MicroUSB charging cable, a 3.5mm Audio cable and an illustrated clearly written manual are included.The two speakers are 45mm (2.75&#8221;) each, about 7.5cm (3&#8221;) apart and face in opposite directions. Output per speaker is 3.5 W and the unit charges at DC5V through a Li-ion battery 3.7V\/1400mAh. It took an average of four hours to fully charge and lasted 5 hours of play. A red LED is on when charging.Sound:- Highs and upper range are very good to excellent. Bass, midrange and lower tones average. Best for listening to music but annoyingly slow (with Bluetooth) when watching a video; there is a half a second delay between image and sound reminiscent of old, dubbed foreign movies. No delay when connected to source by cables.Volume:- Amazingly high for a speaker of this size. Sound fills a large room, a large backyard, around the pool etc. Best resonance from TF card, and mobile phone, computer or tablet in close proximity.PROS: Pairing by Bluetooth is easy and intuitive.Water resistant - light sprinkle etc.Good Bluetooth range.Powerful volume.One year warranty.CONS: Audio Range uneven (good highs, poor bass\/lows)Not waterproof.Audio delay during video.Voice prompts\/announcements - can become annoying.Use as phone speaker is haphazard with frequent cut-offs.Overall, the speaker bar is much better than expected for its size and price.A complimentary sample was provided for evaluation and review.","rating":4},{"comment":"I have tested at least 10 bluetooth speakers in the past year, and this MOCREO is easily in the top five based on ease of use and sound quality. Not being a member of the current generation who can pick up any electronic device and get it working instantly and intuitively, I approach most electronic devices with some misgiving.  I needn't have worried about the MOCREO.  Set up with my Android phone was child's play. Before taking the plunge, I simply connected the speaker to my phone with the supplied cable to listen to the speaker.For the impatient charging does take a few hours, so start that chore right away with the included cable. I attached the USB cord to an adapter I had handy and charged the speaker with AC, quicker that way.Aesthetics - I like the design, appearance, and materials used for this speaker. Volume controls and microphone are right on top. A button for answering the phone is on the side and is easy to find just by running a finger across the surface. My speaker is white though I would have preferred a darker color.  It's kind of unusual but quaint to hear the female voice announcing that the speaker is ready for pairing or is turning off now.Sound - To test the speaker I blasted it to the max to listen for vibration or distortion. Even the voices of Roy Orbison and Chris Isaac didn't tax the little speakers. Songs by ZZ Top with plenty of percussion also passed the sound and endurance  test. You won't confuse the MOCREO with Bose speakers, but I know I wasn't disappointed. Those who like intense bass might be.Phone function -  A lot depends on the phone quality on the other end. My first test was disappointing, but subsequent phone conversations were more than satisfactory. Voices are clear and distinct on the MOCREO and plenty loud.Portability - This is a real plus. I can play music from my phone or listen to a Netflix video over the speaker when it's placed many feet away. On the bathroom windowsill it fills the room with sound that even overcomes the competition of the shower's running water.Bottom line - The MOCREO is a good, portable bluetooth speaker with plenty of applications.","rating":5},{"comment":"This bar-style, Bluetooth speaker by MOCREO is packed with features and delivers impressive sound quality and volume. I have a number of portable Bluetooth speakers which I use constantly to boost the volume from my laptop, tablets and iPhone so I'm very familiar with them. This one stands out for its sound quality and the fact that it is waterproof, allowing me to use it in the shower, at poolside or on the beach. (MOCREO cautions that this speaker can be used in wet locations but should not be submerged in water.)This speaker measures 7\" x 2 1\/2\" x 2 1\/2\". It has rubberized feet to keep it stable on whatever surface you place it. On top there are two huge buttons to control the volume and an external mic. On the side you'll find a micro USB charging port, headphone jack and micro SD card slot underneath a rubberized port cover and a power button and Bluetooth pairing button.There is also a small loop on one side for hanging. I ran a cord through it so I could wear it around my neck while unloading the car and setting up for a day on the beach. I also use it to hang my speaker from a hook in the shower.This speaker connected easily and quickly via Bluetooth to my iPhone, iPod, iPad, my Surface Pro and my laptop. That's when I discovered that it also speaks to me! No guessing or watching to see if it has paired or if it has detected the micro SD card - it tells me in a lovely, female voice with a vaguely Asian accent that is enchanting.If you are playing music from your phone and a call comes in, MOCREO says it pauses the music so you can answer the call and resumes when you are finished. On my iPhone, it did pause the music but I had to hit the answer button on my phone and select the sound bar as the speaker for the call. On my husband's Windows phone, it paired easily and played music flawlessly but it did not pause the music for an incoming call. This isn't particularly disappointing or surprising because very few devices work properly with Windows phones yet.The sound is really impressive and I'm especially surprised at the sound quality of voices. Music is crisp and clear with no muddiness. I can hardly believe the volume that comes out of this speaker. It's definitely loud enough to overcome the sounds of the waves and wind crashing at the beach. And that's where I really appreciate the micro SD card slot. I loaded a 32GB card with my favorite music and enjoyed it all day on the beach without having to expose my phone to the salty, damp sea breezes.Note: the card slot is referred to as a TF card slot but that seems to be another term for micro SD card. My regular Kingston micro SD card fit perfectly and the music on it played flawlessly.This speaker is a little larger than most portable Bluetooth speakers because it delivers a lot more sound. The price is very attractive and surprising considering the great features. If you're looking for a Bluetooth speaker, this one should definitely be on your list for consideration.NOTE: I was given a sample for reviewing purposes but a positive review was neither promised or implied.","rating":5},{"comment":"I purchased this speaker to use at the beach and while paddle boarding, and it works well for both.  I'm not sure I would submerge this under water for an extended period of time, but I have used it on my paddle board, bungeed right to the deck and it handles the water just fine.  I also use this at the beach with no problems.  I seems to keep sand out well too.As for the quality of the sound, this is not a home system replacement speaker.  It is not on par with my logitech bluetooth stereo speaker.  It is a decent sound quality, however, and it is loud enough for what I need it for.  It has more power than it can effectively translate into sound, however.  Cranked all the way up, there is a lot of distortion and it wrecks the sound.  On the range between moderately loud and soft levels, however, this is adequate.Pairing has been very easy with an iPhone 5s, the only device I've paired it with.  It picks right up and finds the signal.  The large buttons on top are good for both changing the song and for changing the volume (press and hold for volume).  I have not had any trouble losing signal, or with any kind of static or choppiness during playback.  I have used it mainly outdoors when the phone was not far away.  Indoors for testing, it seems to be decent range, but again, not quite as good as my logitech speaker.I am impressed with this speaker for the price.  It has made it easy and affordable to take music with me to some outdoor places I haven't had music for awhile.  I recommend the Mocreo speaker if that's the sort of thing you're looking for.","rating":5},{"comment":"This puppy has some boom-bah!  I only have two issues of note, both of which combine to lose a star.Sound Performance: On classic rock and roll, streaming from iHeartRadio, there was actually a kind of tinny output in the upper range, and the bass seemed... lackluster  (Beatles and Cream).  However, with SD card stored classical (Bach) and iHeartRadio streaming New Age (Kitaro), performance was excellent both in highs and lows.  But in all cases, I actually had quite a bit of distortion with both spectrum ends at max volume, getting the best overall result at approximately 2\/3rds of maximum volume.  Nevertheless, even at 2\/3rds, this has room filling presence.  It is certainly louder and has wider presence than my Anker cube speaker, which is at the same price point as this speaker.  And for listening to YouTube blogs and other &#34;talk&#34; streaming, these are the best for that I have experienced to date.Volume Control:  In order to control volume on the sound bar, you LONG press the [+] and [-] buttons.  Pushing them once, as would be intuitive to me, changes tracks.  This results in a lack of &#34;fine tuning&#34; sound control as the volume adjustment is continuous up or down, making hitting that sweet spot more difficult than it should be.  Frankly, changing the setup to control tracks with an LONG press and volume with a single push would seem to have been a better choice.Having said all that, this is still a rather magnificent speaker.  The added flexibility of using a TF\/MicroSD card (maximum of 16 gigs) is a nice touch.  I weighed the unit itself at 13.36 ozs, so it has some heft withstand poolside breezes without rolling merrily off a table.  And that is exactly where it is going, my backyard pool deck.  I had been using a pair of Hercules computer speakers connected through a netbook, but its overall volume just didn't really carry.  Mocreo's speaker surprisingly out performs those twin Hercules (which were not cheap speakers :P ).And on a far minor note, the included 3.5mm cord and USB charging cable are of a decent length, and not the usual chintzy, mere inches long, impractical freebies I often get and throw away.-- I received this product as a complimentary review sample.  If you have any questions about performance or otherwise, feel free to post a comment!  I'll be happy to find out what I can and even post results here or on my YouTube channel.  Call it a remote floor demonstration.  Heh.","rating":4},{"comment":"I am SO impressed with this speaker!  I wanted something to take out to the garden with me, and this waterproof speaker is perfect.  I can keep my iPod in my pocket while I work, and if I get the speaker wet while sprinkling, it's no big deal.But the waterproof quality really isn't the thing that sells me on this.  I like the sound quality very much.  I'm not a high tech audiophile, I just want something that plays music that's not distorted, and that has a reasonable dynamic range.  The MOCREO speaker does just that.  Also, setup is really simple.  You turn it on, pair it with a Bluetooth device and you're good to go.  If the pairing doesn't take place in a minute or two, the speaker powers off.  The charge lasts for hours.  I've been playing for the last three days on one charge.  A full charge takes a couple of hours, and it can be charged with a stand-alone USB charger.The only problem I had with pairing was on my laptop, using a Bluetooth dongle, but it wasn't the speaker's fault, and I can use an Aux In cord to listen to music via my laptop so it's all good.  I'm listening to Spotify right now, and it makes me very happy.If you're looking for a good, solid Bluetooth speaker, and you don't care that it doesn't pound out bass that sounds like the hounds of Hell are coming to get you, this is a good, reasonably priced option.","rating":5},{"comment":"This Bluetooth enabled external speaker by Mocreo, delivers good sound quality, with a nice amount of low end, for its size.  Powered by rechargeable batteries, the rated life is six hours.  The speaker can be connected via Bluetooth, or hard wired using a standard 1\/8\" audio connection.  There is also a micro SD card slot, so you can also play preselected audio files.Controls are relatively simple, with a set of \"+\" (plus) and \"-\" (minus) buttons, on the top of the unit.  Volume is raised or lowered, by holding down the corresponding button.  Pressing the plus button skips to the next track, while pressing the minus button skips back on track.  The speakers can also be linked to a Bluetooth enabled phone, and has a microphone to answer calls.With a rubber base, and some rubber panels, the speaker enclosure is weather resistant, but not waterproof.  The connector ports are protected by a removable rubber strip.  The speakers are capable of reaching some pretty high volumes, without distorting too much.  There is a metal grill on the front and back panels, which gives the unit a very solid feel.Once turned on, the speaker pairs quickly with any previously paired Bluetooth device that may be available.  Bluetooth connectivity has priority, so if a micro SD card is inserted, you may have to pop it out, and then back in again, for it to be recognized.  For the SD card, the speakers will remember the last track that was played, and resume playing there.  This is very convenient, although the volume does come on at a preset level, which is quite loud.The device has a number of prerecorded spoken notifications, which are in a female voice with a slight Asian accent.  They include \"Hey, I'm ready, waiting for a connection\", \"Charge complete\", \"Enjoy card music\", and \"Power off\".  Kind of quirky, but you get used to it.The nice people at Mocreo provided a sample for evaluation.  I have a number of portable Bluetooth speakers, and this one is definitely one of the better ones.  Sound quality is quite rich and full, and build quality is very solid.  The micro SD slot is a cool feature, and the memory function is really convenient.  Color options are black or white.  The price is competitive, making it a nice option for those looking for a portable Bluetooth speaker.","rating":5},{"comment":"If you're like me, you have a small bathroom that steams up pretty quickly. This makes life a bit difficult when you want music in there. Well, thank you MOCREO for creating the Waterproof Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker (mouthful!).I tested this with my iPhone 5S. Pairing via Bluetooth was a simple process, taking just a few seconds. After that, I immediately played some music from my iPhone, and was quite surprised at the sound this little box can put out. Given that it's \"waterproof,\" I figured there would be some muffled or distorted audio, but there wasn't. The sound is a little... low-end, but it's definitely good enough for a bathroom or small outside area background speaker.Bass is pretty tightly controlled, and while the unit itself you can feel vibrating if you put your hand on it, there's no indication of the vibration carried through to the actual audio you hear. Good stuff.The giant + and - on the top of the unit changes the track with a quick press, and changes volume on a long press.One funny thing is the, \"Waiting for connection,\" voice is spoken in rather broken English, the next voice, \"Bluetooth Connected,\" is spoken in American English, and then the \"Power off\" voice is spoken - \"Ower off,\" because the \"P\" got cut off. Oops! Definitely a little rough around edges.Overall, though, this is a decent speaker if you need the waterproof ability it offers. While I'd hesitate to dunk it in the sink, it's more than happy sitting on your steamy bathroom counter, or getting splashed by the sink.4 stars out of 5. A solid purchase.*Sample provided for review*","rating":4},{"comment":"Until the hybrid drive were created, storage was a choice of solid state (fast and expensive) or a spinning hard disk (slower and cheaper).If you are not familiar with &#8220;Hybrid Drives&#8221; they are storage devices that combine NAND flash solid-state drive (SSD) with hard disk drive (HDD) technology, with the intent of adding some of the speed of SSDs to the cost-effective storage capacity of traditional HDDs. The purpose of the SSD in a hybrid drive is to act as a cache for the data stored on the HDD, by keeping copies of the most frequently used data on the SSD for improved overall performance.This Toshiba hybrid has 930GB of actual storage on the disk; with a rotational speed of 5,400 RPM, a Cache \/ Data Buffer of 32MB and a NAND Flash size 8 GB.The instructions suggest professional installation, but it is really simple to do yourself with only a couple of small Phillips screws to remove.  The old drive just unplugs and the new one plugs right in. Be sure to back up your old drive before removing it.The first thing I have noticed is the start up is faster. Boot time went from an average of 56 seconds to 38 seconds (also 5400-rpm drive) using Windows 7.  This was after a &#34;break-in period&#34; while the software learns which data to cache.  Accessing data is faster as well, although I haven&#8217;t measured the time.The extra storage space was a nice upgrade.  It is not much more to go to the hybrid drive rather than a standard drive, so I am happy with the Toshiba.","rating":5},{"comment":"The moment I saw this hybrid ssd, I jumped at the chance to acquire it. I collect videos, movies, music, type fonts and back up my hard drives three times! \"Operation Overkill\"? Perhaps. One of the backups is stored in a bedroom safe. What I do know a little bit about is a solid state drive. What I knew nothing about was a hybrid drive. What I failed to notice that this drive is for Windows 7 and 8... not Vista. Woe is me! I use and love Vista. That's how I got the nickname, Vista Bill! Well, I saw that this is a SATA drive so I figured that if I format it for NTFS, I could use it on my machine. I wanted to use it as a portable external drive so I ordered an enclosure for it. When the drive and enclosure arrived, I could not wait to get started! If \"disk management\" could see the drive, I would be on my way! Then, while I was waiting for USPS to bring the disk, I did a search of hybrid ssds and there was some indications that Vista would treat the drive as they treat Ready Boost technology. With Vista, there is a four gigabyte limit to Ready Boost. Uh, oh! Will this be a problem? Will the disk format in NTFS or simply in FAT? I'd soon find out! I opened the \"disk manager\", set it up to format in NTFS. The formatting started (this takes about 12 hours for a one terabyte disk), went to bed with complete confidence that I would be successful. When I got up, the formatting was no longer showing on my desktop! I checked the disk manager and the disk had been formatted in FAT. Not good! I checked \"my computer\" to see if the drive was listed. It was. I clicked on it. The message said that the drive needed to be formatted before I could use it. I started the process (again). As the format slowly progressed, I noticed that the \"allocation\" was around 4 gb... Is that all I'll have available on this nice drive? I cancelled. Thought about this. Decided to unplug and replug the disk and set up a new format. I changed the allocation to \"default\" (I have no idea how much the default is). Then instead of the normal format, I clicked \"quick format\". This is a brand new drive, there should be no bad sectors or anything else that the normal format looks for so I felt safe with a quick format. Within minutes, the format was complete! I checked the disk manager and all is ok, unplugged and replugged and the drive appeared in \"my computer\" with a full allocation. I copied a file to the disk. Everything is perfect. I am very happy! One note of caution (that I almost always do not notice) is that if you are considering purchasing one of these solid state drives and do not know what \"hybrid\" means, find out so you won't have a problem. If you are not running Windows 7 or 8 and plan to use this drive as your primary drive, I would advise you to look elsewhere. My use is not as a primary or other internal drive. I am using the drive as a portable external drive for storage.","rating":5},{"comment":"I actually didn't use this in a laptop. This IS a laptop drive, but I installed it in a desktop. The screw holes don't align correctly for the hard drive slots, being too far apart. However, it fit where there was an empty slot for another CD drive. How it fits in your PC case may vary. In any case, it DOES have ports for standard SATA cables and the power cable.This is not a pure solid state drive or a pure hard drive. It has 8 GB of flash memory, and a 1 TB hard disk at 5400 rpm. How it works is that after you use it enough it figures out what files you use the most and keeps them stored in the flash memory. So, the 8 GB of files used the most get cached and are accessed very quickly. It works quite nicely.","rating":5},{"comment":"I'm not up on any real technical jargon (not very computer literate but I do okay), but this 2.5 inch internal hybrid drive works very well thus far and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.","rating":4},{"comment":"I used this product to replace my current 500 Gb Toshiba standard internal laptop hard drive. Originally my boot speed from power button to windows start took 60 seconds, my hard drive took a lot of cooling power (my fan was always running hard), and I was getting write speeds of about 10 to 15 Mb\/s. After replacing with this drive, my boot time is 35 seconds, my fan works a lot less, and I&#8217;m getting write speeds of about 15 to 20 Mb\/s. Obviously this hybrid drive is slower than an SSD, but for a comparable SSD you&#8217;d be paying at least 5 times as much. I&#8217;d say for the speed boost from the hybrid, the size, and price, this kind of drive is the way to go.","rating":5},{"comment":"I got this to freshen up an old laptop that was running so slowly, I could practically hear it groaning.  I was hoping this would come with some sort of installation instructions, but alas. \"Professional Installation Recommended.\"  So unless you know what you're doing, you're totally on your own.Fortunately, I have a tech-savvy friend who was able to do the installation for me.  Was surprised it only took a few minutes.  And... wowie!  It's like a brand new laptop!  Better than it was originally in terms of speed and storage.  If I had known this option existed, I probably could have skipped purchasing my current laptop (which came pre-installed with the dreaded Windows 8).Recommended!","rating":5},{"comment":"If you want a lot of storage, but still want a slight boost in performance this might be the hard drive for you.  It gives you 1tb of space, which SSD's really can't do yet, and when they do it will be quite expensive.  This also gives a chunk of SSD in order to buffer reads and writes to the drive.  This means that most common used applications and OS should be very quick since they will be cached, and writing to the disk should be quick as well since it should be cached.The downsides is that 8gb isn't very much space, probably not enough to do all the things mentioned above, but it will help here and there.  Unless you really want a boost on a few things like this, I'd recommend just getting a faster laptop drive (7200rpm one) and it still will be cheaper.  Otherwise find one with more SSD space.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is an awesome product. I have a small laptop I use for travel that doesn't have a big hard drive, and use this with an enclosure as an external hard drive. It was so easy to hook up, and worked easily with that laptop. It's definitely made a noticeable difference in how fast that laptop runs now, and is still easy to travel with. Even better, going from travel laptop to my regular one, I can just hook this up to either one to transfer files as I need to, especially picture files that take up a lot of space in dropbox, etc. This is also lets me store a ton of music on it, and be able to listen to it on either computer without needing to redownload songs, etc. And previously, I didn't listen to much music on my travel laptop as a result of the small HD size, and that problem is now eliminated.For the size of this thing, the price is also wonderful. And it's so easy to use, easy to install, and very useful as an external hard drive or, I'm sure, internal. Completely recommend.","rating":5},{"comment":"I'm very, very happy to report that this is the best drive for the PS4.... unless of course you're wealthy and can afford a 1TB pure SSD.  You get performance that's closer to a real SSD than a traditional HD, and you get twice as much space as the stock Hitachi drive that comes in the PS4.  The hardware installation itself was super-easy.  I just Binged upgrade ps4 drive and it led me to the official Sony support page right away.  Yes, Sony encourages you to upgrade the PS4's drive DIY!  You just need a single Philips screwdriver and an at least 1GB flash drive for the job.After installation and restoring the PS4 software.... oh of course all downloaded games and apps must be redownloaded, too bad we can't just clone the original drive yet...  my upgraded PS4 definitely feels faster at starting up and also launching games.  You have to keep in mind that the PS4 is already a high-end PC and super-fast at everything to begin with, so using this drive gives you visible performance upgrade in two aspects: faster startup times, and more capacity.  There's no benchmarking utility, my estimate is starting from stand-by is at least 2x as fast as before. What's more significant to me is when I download and copy files, the speed gain is totally there.I should mention this SSHD consists of 8GB of NAND and 1TB of 5400RPM spin drive.  I just wish there were a way to install this in my MacBook Pro, as I only have 256GB of SSD there.  No cloning utility appears to be included, but I remember Toshiba does provide such a free utility through its support website, if only for Windows.","rating":5},{"comment":"I upgraded my PS4 with this and I love it.  It's somewhat faster than a spinning platter, but we're getting into the point of diminishing returns territory.  It takes the system less than half a second to launch a game.

But now that we all know how quickly spinners can die, SSD's are a lot more attractive for long term archiving, and the prices have just started to really drop. In response, suddenly the spinners are cratering in price; there are 3 TB externals on here now for less than 130! Seems incredible from the perspective of even 2009, but in 2019 we might get 3 TB flash sticks for ten bucks, so it's all relative. One thing for sure: pretty soon we'll have more cheap space than we have stuff to store on it.What does that have to do with this 1 TB SATA drive? Well, my thought is that this is mainly useful for daily applications in a laptop, but unless you need this much space, I'd hold off and just get a smaller spinner drive, or better yet a SSD. SSD's are giving me performance on a much higher level than even one of these, and this is one of the fastest spinner HDs I've used.The 8gb NAND helps it get going quickly, and it does load faster than any other spinner I've used with 7 Ultimate. Not nearly as quick as a SSD though, so keep that in mind if speed is more vital than mega-space. This drive runs pretty quietly, and medium-warm, not hot, but once again the SSD is a much better beast in every way.Comparing this to other internal 1 TB drives I've used, it's the best of the bunch. I also put this in a HD caddy and it worked well there. Though I have a I TB Toshiba Canvio external that works just as well, and it costs about 65 if you look around, so this drive is only worth the present price of 110 if it's for internal use.By the way, the Canvios---and Toshiba drives in general---have a lot of gone-dead-fast stories on here and other review sites, but speaking purely from my own experience, I've had good luck with them, and they've held up just as well as Western for me.All told, this is a nice fast spinner hybrid. But I would honestly recommend considering pure solid state if you don't need all this space. You can get 128 gig SSD's for this price now, and within one or maybe two years I think you'll get at least 500. And those drives should (should!) last far longer than this. Just something to keep in mind when considering hybrid vs. pure solid state.","rating":4},{"comment":"Laptops older than a year or two shipped with 500GB drives or smaller, so you may want \/ need to upgrade anyway. Why not consider one with an embedded SSD?I replaced a 1TB new (&#60; 60 days) Hitachi 7K1000 7200RPM 32MB cache drive that I was not unhappy with. I didn't notice a giant Windows 7 12GB (main memory) performance difference overall, but had modest expectations. If you use a tool like Paragon Hard Disk manager to replace the drive (budget a long time to do this via USB 2 on a 1TB drive unless you have eSATA), you won't be able to easily push Windows to use the SSD effectively. That's a benefit that might require a fresh Windows installation (have your install disks handy? They're often not shipped with new laptops these days).But my goal was to use the SSD for audio file caching with Cakewalk Sonar, Ableton Live or Native Instruments appls. The 8GB space provided is small, but I move audio files in and out of it when needed.I hope to post some benchmarks here later.","rating":4},{"comment":"The performance difference was impressive for my 7 year old Windows 7 machine.  But don't make the mistake of thinking that you can just swap out the old hard drive for the new.  It's not a difficult process to clone the old drive to the new one, but it's not for the inexperienced or faint of heart.There are a number of freeware options that you can download that make that portion of the operation pretty straightforward.  Just do a little research and you should be good.  As for performance... wow, what an improvement.  I recommend it!","rating":4},{"comment":"This Toshiba 1TB notebook solid state drive is something I've been wanting for a long time now that the prices of SSD's are becoming more and more reasonable and my 2009 macbook pro is maxed out at 500GB because I have a tremendous music library so the upgrade to the 1TB is awesome, another thing that is awesome is the 8GB of nano flash which essentially works as a RAM boost and definitely made me notice boot speed upgrade. A good product","rating":4},{"comment":"This drive is made to use in a laptop\/notebook. I decided to try it in my desktop.It is a 5400 rpm drive, and desktop drives are 7200, so I was concerned it would be slower even with the 8 GB memory. I put the drive in the desktop, ran software to migrate the Operating System to it, rebooted, and it works fine. All I have on it at the moment is the OS, which is Windows 8.1 64 bit. I do notice it booting up and shutting down a bit quicker.It's kind of a waste of the 1 terabyte drive just to have the OS on it, if I decide to keep it in the desktop, I might put some tunes on it. The bad thing about SSD's is they die quicker if you do a lot of writes to the drive, reading is no problem, so keep that in mind with any ssd drives. This being a hybrid, not really sure if or how that will affect it, hence my only putting the OS on it. Many reads, little writes.I may put it in my laptop later, would be nice to have all that storage space there instead of the 2 320 Gig drives that are in there and mostly full. So bottom line is for a laptop it kicks ass, for a desktop, not so awesome, better off getting a full ssd for a desktop.","rating":4},{"comment":"We installed this in a Windows 7 Toshiba laptop that somehow had never performed properly.

Restoring programs -- and Windows, of course, was a bit of a muddle but that was to be expected.Almost all my usage is low-level vanilla Word, Powerpoint and straightforward Web browsing, email and Skype. I don't have any way of measuring the impact on overall speed. It certainly seems to improve startup and loading, but wi-fi performance is far more a factor than disk for me.It seems a good intermediate tool between standard hard disk and full SSD. I just wonder if it's worth paying the price rather than accepting OK laptop performance or buying a new machine.

At least this is what I found with the benchmarks on my system. Both are really slow, compared to modern counterparts. With sustained reads, modern drives can read up to 100MB\/s from magnetic media, and 400MB\/s from SSDs, making both of them around a third of current top models.Still this might be a good compromise if the pricing is right.","rating":3},{"comment":"These hybrid SSD HDs really improved the overall speed of my computer.

A Solid State Hybrid is essentially a hard drive which has a certain amount of NAND Flash memory as the cachet, in this case 8GB of NAND Flash, a SATA 6.0Gb\/s interface and the big a capacity of mechanical magnetic disk. It stores the most often used tasks and accessed data in the NAND cache for faster access. (Imagine the NAND Flash cachet as if it were a mini SSD within the SSH).Besides price, the advantage of a SSH over a SSD, is that the SSHD doesn't have a limited lifespan like all SSD drives do. This SSHD might be still running in another decade, even if by then we will be using much bigger files and I would be needing a bigger drive too. But for now, this 1TB is simply perfect for my needs. I used my Toshiba Hybrid to replace the HDD in my laptop and it gave it new stamina. It reminds me of when I installed a SSD in my netbook and it acted as if I had added RAM and a newer CPU. This time, I noticed the expected increase in booting time, and a significant performance in general.One thing worth commenting, it's that this Toshiba Hybrid is a 1TB 5400 RPM drive and I just use it to replace a 500GB 7200 RPM drive, besides the significant performance in booting speed, a 5400 RPM HDD uses less energy and gets less hot, so in an enclose case, like a laptop or All-In-One, the 5400 RPM drive is a better choice. Now, remember, we're talking about a Hybrid which delivers a SSD-like performance. This drive is great, I highly recommended it.","rating":5},{"comment":"I'm not one either.  I usually address dead or dying computers by replacing the whole thing with a whole new upgraded unit. I keep my important information backed up on my Norton account, so can proceed from there with my new machine.However, Amazon Vine was offering this Toshiba 1TB Hybrid drive, and  we happen to have an older laptop in the house that has been grinding to a slow halt, so I thought I'd give this a try.  The laptop, by the way, is Toshiba branded, so I was fairly confident this new drive would plug in.  It did, but as it also turns out, this is a standardized component and is a straightforward drop-in install in about any Windows 7 or 8 laptop (also works with Mac OS X and Linux) with this industry common ATA interface and 2.5 inch hard drive.  Additionally, this is called a \"hybrid\" device, which in this case seems to mean it uses a blend of technologies combining the speed of flash drive storage (solid state drive, or SSD), with the huge storage capacity of a traditional hard disk drive (HDD).  All of the important data on the my old laptop had been copied over to an iPad, so . . . nothing to lose.In short, OUTSTANDING results.  Installation was a no brainer. Literally a plug-in, requiring only a small Phillips screwdriver.  The new drive is obviously fast.  I haven't measured it with a stopwatch, and there is not a whole lot of data on it yet (you'll have to restore your wanted programs and files), but even compared to other brand new computers, this thing is now lightning quick.

As that change becomes more common, transitional devices like this one from Inateck will be increasingly necessary. I have used (and reviewed) several INatek accessories and have found them to be well made and without functional flaws.  This one, tried on the desktop of a willing friend with a newer computer and an available bay slot was no exception..Each connected device ran at it's advertised speed without glitch.  The installation was pretty straight forward. Pop it into the available bay and plug the 20-pin plug in to the Motherboard or the USB 3.0 card that is also a simple matter to install... IF you have an available card slot - I did not :-(For the cost, if your situation is a good match for this device, you gain two more USB 3.0 ports that are as reliable as is your computer.Manufacturing electronics available through other manufacturers, INatek is acquiring\/earning a reputation for well-designed, sturdily-built and fairl;y priced electronic accessories.

While it is easy to throw a USB 3.0 card into an old motherboard, there is generally no simple way to switch out the built-in ports.  This little device essentially does that for you by adding two ports to a 3.5&#34; expansion bay.Normal installation is simple -- knock out the drive bay cover, slide the hub in, add some screws, and plug in the cable.  I have a USB 3.0 card with the correct header, but a motherboard with USB 3.0 will also generally work.  It is the same sort of connector that you would use to connect case USB ports.  Don't have an empty 3.5&#34; bay?  A little DIY work with a dremel or an adapter will probably give you a decent result.The bay is made of sturdy black plastic that matches standard black plastic case fronts well.  For USB devices, I normally give the results of speed tests, but those are not appropriate here because this device relies on the chipset of the device it is plugged into.  I can say that the wires and connectors are very sturdy and well made and devices connected to this behave similar to those attached directly to the card.For this price, it is a great upgrade to a computer that you might be using extension USB cables on, creating a mess, or having to reach around to the back to use thumb drives with.  The only &#34;upgrade&#34; would be a fancy metal finish and build, but that would demand a more premium price.In summary, despite receiving a review unit at no charge, I plan to buy one too!","rating":5},{"comment":"Before you buy, you will want to open your computer up and verify that there is a connector for this on your motherboard. If you look at the picture, you will see an example of what the connector looks like. If your motherboard does NOT have this connector, either you can't use this OR you will need to purchase an expansion card (Inateck sells one of those as well, but ensure you get one that has the internal 20-pin connector or this expansion won't work). You can find onehere from them.One other thing to be aware of is where the screw holes are for your 3.5 bay. If they are on the bottom, you won't be able to secure the Inateck front panel to your computer, meaning when you remove a device you'll want to hold the bay in place. If your bay is like most cases, you will have side screw options which will work perfectly for this. Just ensure you have a free 3.5\" bay, otherwise you can also purchase a 3.5 to 5.25 bay expansion so this would fit in a larger bay. Be aware that some OEM cases, such as Dells, won't have a 3.5\" bay anymore, so you would definitely need an expansion for them.So once you ensure everything is ready to go and you have all your parts, connecting this is bang on simple. Power off and unplug the computer. Open the computer (process is different for every case really), pop out the bay cover. Slide this in, screw it in (if you have side screws). Run the cable to the 20 pin connector either on your motherboard or the expansion card you bought and you are ready to rock.If you have UASP capable devices, connected to a UASP capable expansion card or motherboard, you should see really, really fast speeds from your devices. I've gotten ~400 MB\/s using a Samsung EVO SSD and this configuration (using Inateck's2.5 Inch USB 3.0 Hard Drive Disk Enclosure). Once you experience UASP speeds, you won't go back to platter based hard drives and standard USB 3.For non-UASP optimized SSDs, I tried another enclosure like the one above and achieved roughly 150 MB\/s speeds. Not shabby, but not as good as UASP of course.In the end, if you can use the Inateck 3.5 USB expansion in your system, and you want\/need the flexibility of front panel USB ports but don't have them today, and don't mind the \"effort\" needed to open your system and upgrade it, then this expansion bay is an awesome addition to your system.

I'm rating it based mainly on the fact that the hardware is very nice, and the company is obviously working on improving it so I'm expecting that the places where the software falls short will improve over time.Good points:It looks really nice. The quality of the LED screen seems very good, and the touch interface works nicely. I've had no problems with getting it to recognize me. This is a device that will look perfectly lovely sitting on a shelf and displaying some photos while it also stores them for you.It's also nice the the apps back everything up smoothly and don't require a lot of fuss. It didn't take me long to get up and running.Bad points:This isn't really a secure way to back things up, because they haven't supplied a tool that makes it easy to back up the contents of the LyveHome itself (at least, not that I could find). That makes this a project that encourages people to load all of their photos and videos onto one drive... where all of them will be permanently lost if that drive should crash or fail. They need some kind of really easy option to back up the contents to another device. If I still have to keep files on my phone or back them up separately from my phone to my computer, this isn't helping me out as much as it should.I also have this vague, maybe slightly paranoid, concern about what's going to happen one day when someone takes a photo they do NOT want to share. Then, they don't remember that it's there before their phone sends it to the LyveHome where the device automatically starts scrolling the photo along with the others over it's lovely little LED screen. I'm just picturing Grandma and Grandpa visiting down in the living room with the parents when a teenager is taking a topless photo or something. That's not the device's fault, but err... before you turn on the use my photos as a screen saver option, do think about whether you REALLY want your photos to be your screen saver?They also need to work on some significant improvements to your ability to organize, move around, and delete photos. When you're putting 2TB of photo and video on one drive, you need to be able to sort through it and manage it somehow.On the whole, this is a piece of hardware that seems to have received a lot of time and attention. The app that goes with it has a nice clean design so far, though the features need to be improved. This is the basis of a potentially really nice product, but I probably would wait a couple of months to let them do software updates and make improvements.And this last bit should be obvious, but I'll also add that it's far less expensive to back up your photos to a separate drive if you buy something that's just a drive and isn't designed with so much concern about looking nice, or things like LED screens. A 2TB external drive could do a similar job for a lot less money, but I'm sure a lot of people will want this instead because having the cute little photo scroll on the front is a nice touch and it really does look good.","rating":4},{"comment":"This photo video manager is quite nice but also somewhat flawed. Setup is very easy. Just turn the device on and follow the onscreen prompts. Basically, all you really need to do is plug it in and input the ID and password of your WiFi network. Alternatively, you can use an Ethernet cable.Right out of the gate, the unit checked for software updates then downloaded and installed them. You need to create an online account with Lyve to activate the video manager and begin uploading pics to your Lyve. And for me, this is where the hiccup is. The unit has no option to transfer the photos within your local network. Instead, all the photos are transferred to the Lyve unit via the internet which means bandwidth and data are being used. For people with very large photo collections, this is kind of a problem. If you have 100gb of photos, all of that 100gb has to pass through the internet, uploading to Lyve online, and then downloading to the Lyve unit itself. So that's 200gb of data being transferred in total. And that's no small thing.I contacted Lyve about this and got a terribly vague reply that said data could be sent over wifi or ethernet; but no mention was made about local data transfers or internet transfers. So, just to be sure, I conducted a test of my own. I started a large transfer to my Lyve unit and then pulled the plug on my internet connection. My local network was still functional and active, but my internet was offline. And, just as expected, my transfer to Lyve was interrupted and could not be completed because it is dependent on a live internet connection and continuous data use.Alternatively to wireless transfers, you can plug hard drives and media cards directly into the Lyve base unit and it will automatically extract and transfer all the photos. But you will have virtually no control over the process. Everything is transferred, or nothing.The Lyve companion software for computers is almost useless. There are virtually no options to view any of your pictures. Not only that, but my home network doesn't even show that Lyve is connected, so there is virtually no way to access it from a computer.  It's one of those iOS moments, where the manufacturer is letting you know that you can't be trusted to operate your own stuff as you'd like; you have to do it their way or not at all. So in effect, the PC companion software is almost useless.Android apps work quite well. You can browse photos, delete and organize your Lyve.  The camera upload feature is cool. Any pictures you take with your Android device will automatically be uploaded to Lyve and stored. However, the  Dropbox app has that exact same feature and transfers are near instantaneous.  While with live, there are long processing and wait times before that picture gets anywhere near the Lyve base unit.Personally, I think this is a cool little digital picture frame. I love how the images slowly scroll upward; for me that's this things biggest asset.  The live transfer features are completely bogged down; I would use them if I had no other option, but it's certainly not great. I'll stick to Dropbox and my local backups; it's just faster and more convenient.The Lyve Photo Video manager is a decent solution, but truly is more for technological illiterates. If you know anything at all about computers, this process will feel shackled and overly restricted.  However, if you're one of those people who struggles just to turn a computer on, then Lyve will be your new best friend; provided you can get it setup in the first place.The complete absence of any real computer access to the base unit and the lack of local data transfer options make this one a fail for me personally. I would never pay this kind of premium to be completely locked down like this.  However, as a cool little digital picture frame, I like this a lot.  Either way, it's overpriced for what it is. Decent, but certainly not great. The base unit itself is 4 stars, the software execution is 2 stars; so that leaves me with a 3 star overall rating.","rating":3},{"comment":"I never thought I'd want a digital picture frame, but I LOVE this!

Being able to access those photos, and this drive, in so many ways and from so many devices, will make it valuable for years to come, and I look forward to seeing how it'll hold up over time. And if there are any photos you DON'T want to come up on the clear, crisp (albeit not terribly large) screen, it's easy enough to adjust the settings of the LyveHome so that it doesn't automatically upload EVERYTHING on the connected\/linked device. I have to say, though (as others have said) that it really IS nice to have those long-forgotten images taken so many months\/years ago, in plain sight, where I can enjoy them anytime I'd like. :)Setting the LyveHome Photo and Video Manager up wasn't terribly difficult, but I did experience a few glitches. I uploaded about 450 photos from my Galaxy Note 3 with little overall problem, aside from the issue of having the drive not recognize (and consequently upload) about 80 or so of those photos. For some odd reason, when the only thing that was accessing those images was the LyveHome app, it skipped those images, claiming that they were being accessed from something else during the upload. They weren't, but since they remain on my smartphone, I just deleted those images from the LyveHome app's upload list, and kept it moving to the other images that I was trying to upload. Since I'm still on vacation in Florida as I type this, I've also uploaded the images I've taken here, to my LyveHome device at home, with no problem other than slow upload times, which I attribute to wonky WiFi in my current location (and it IS wonky where I'm staying, so that's the most likely cause for the slow image transferral).Overall, I'm happy with my experiences with my LyveHome Manager, and think that it's worth the investment if the price is right for you. I can especially see this being helpful for those that take LOTS of pictures, be they professional photographers, aspiring pros, or just those that enjoy taking lots of photos on a daily basis, or while traveling. It's nice to have a device with plenty of space, a small footprint, and many outlets for loading up those images stashed here and there and everywhere, so that all of your treasured shots are kept safe and sound in one location. And knowing that you can access those consolidated images from just about anywhere?

The LyveHome Photo and Video Manager does just that.  To make it even sweeter, there is 2TB of storage.

It walks you through the steps so well that even if you're not comfortable with technology, this item won't leave you wondering how to do things.  You aren't wireless?  You can use Ethernet instead.After checking for updates, you sign up for your own account. Next you install apps on whatever you want to transfer photos from.  I chose my laptop and my android-based cell phone.  I also plugged in an SD card.  In an instant, it went to work uploading photos from all three sources, one at a time.  My main complaint about the software is that it starts when you turn on your computer and can cause major lag.  The good thing is that it automatically adds photos as you add them to whatever device has the app.  Concerning the computer software, it uploads EVERYTHING!  If you want to delete a photo, you must do it via the touchscreen on the device.  Either way, you're still going to have to do some work to pick and choose photos.  The android software is better:  you can control what you upload.  Hopefully they will update the computer software in the future.Your photos scroll upward and you can have a clock at the bottom of the screen.  It doesn't take up much space so it looks nice on a desk.  My only concern about the unit itself is that it gets very warm\/hot.  Thus far it works well, but will it cause it to stop working in the future?  Only time will tell.Overall I like it which is why I gave it 5 stars.  It's a pretty expensive toy but when you consider what it does (storage and electronic photo album) I feel it's worth it.**UPDATE**  For some unknown reason the item gave me a blue screen with the word \"Lyve\" on it and the pictures stopped scrolling.  That concerned me.  I decided to unplug it and wait 30 seconds before plugging it back in.  At first the same blue screen appeared and I thought \"Uh Oh.\"  Within a few seconds a white circle appeared at the bottom of the screen and spun around which indicated it was thinking.  (I could also feel movement going on because I was holding it.)  In a few more seconds my pictures came back and were scrolling again.  Will I take any stars away or take away my recommendation?  No, not in the least.  I understand that technology sometimes gets hiccups and need a little TLC.  If it continuously happens I'll update my review.","rating":5},{"comment":"I've had this for a month now. My impressions overall are mixed and i dont really know what purpose it is trying to serve.It is not a photo manager as it says, there are barely any such tools to really manage the photos you put on it. The Apple version of the app has some basic stuff like deleting photos and such. But the desktop version i tried (windows 8) has no such thing to manage or even view the photos on the lyve! I do like the fact that it doesnt delete the pictures from the uploading device. There is no way to backup the lyve so you definitely dont want to put all your 'eggs in one basket' as they say. But i suppose this might be annoying for some.So then is it a pretty digital picture frame? I guess that sort of fits, but its a pretty steep price for a picture frame; especially one you have no control over what it shows. It just goes through all the pictures you have uploaded onto it. I dont understand why i cant specifically choose what pictures\/ albums i want shown on the LCD screen. Am i the only one who has photos they want to store but not show everyone that comes over to my house? So no, i dont think it properly qualifies as a picture frame either. Though i do think the hardware is very good quality and yes , the LCD touchscreen is nice and pretty as well but for the price that should be expected in my opinion.So is this a storage device that collects your pictures automatically for you from your devices? This fits best... but even then its not very useful because it only supports the 'latest and greatest' smartphone systems ( atleast android 4.1\/ iOS 7 ). Otherwise you still have to manually upload your pictures via USB and that defeats the whole 'automatic' thing. So in conclusion i think this is another product that fits the 'jack of all trades but master of none' category and honestly for the price and current feature set i personally wouldnt recommend it to anyone.","rating":3},{"comment":"We all have come to digital age wherein all our precious memories are now just a mere digital file. A `file' on your PC, a `file' on your tablet, another file on your smartphone and some in MicroSD card, some on a hard disk drive stashed somewhere in a drawer or some lurking somewhere in cloud services which you failed to renew and who knows where else!It has been a classic dilemma for users like me who takes copious amount of photos on a daily basis and that too from so many electronic gadgets including cameras, tablets, smartphones etc.; and the main issue has been how to store them in a centralized location for ease of access. Before this product's existence the solution had been for me is to allocate a network attached storage (NAS) and make a public folder to copy all my digital photo and video files manually from each and every gadget using which I take photos and videos.After few months of using a personal NAS I did find it very hard to keep track of which photo or video file had been backed up into my NAS and there have been numerous occasions wherein I accidentally deleted files from my Smartphone or tablet thinking that I had backed it up into my NAS!LyveHome photo and video Manager designed and developed in Cupertino CA (Silicon valley USA) solves that problem for me beautifully by acting as a `content aggregator' wherein it automatically gathers the photo & video files from all my gadgets which runs the client app from Lyve and makes a copy of the same into the built-in 2TB of storage seamlessly without any user intervention safely and securely using 'WiFi' or 'Wired' network and in my own home or at work - Sort of a 'Personal cloud storage' if you may wish to call it with less anonymity where your personal data is being stored.Technology such as these comes with its own challenges but I was pleasantly surprised that folks at Lyve has done tremendous amount of work behind the scenes making this mammoth task simple as clicking or touching few screens. - Kudos on that! The device itself is very small, white in color blends beautifully connects to Wi-Fi or Wired Ethernet and needs Internet connection at all times for it to work but the actual content (Your personal photos & Videos) gets stored onto the built-in 2TB HDD this product has.PROS[+] Ease of installation - Anyone can do it even if you are not tech savvy[+] Content aggregation work very well as long as you have fast internet connection[+] Doubles as a nice photo frame (Rather than a boring black box HDD)[+] Free Client IOS App, Android App, Supports Kindle Fire (Generation 2 and above)[+] Silent operation no fan no noise[+] HDMI output connection to your TV for display on larger screen (Supports VIZO smartTV wirelessly)[+] Has one USB and one 'SD' card slot for faster upload to the internal 2TB HDD[+] Has digital clock display and screen that is bright, clear and of HD quality[+] Very good quality material and workmanship[+] Fast & courteous `US' based customer technical service via phone & email.CONS[-] Must have Internet access at all times (Does not work without it)[-] Does not work in private networks and if you are having limited data plans your data usage will be high![-] Must create a Lyve ID using the device or using apps before you can use the product[-] Must have fast internet connection (especially upload speeds)[-] There is no backup in cloud as of yet (But that can change in the future may be?)[-] No support for Windows XP PCs, The minimum requirement is Windows 7 SP1 with .NET 4.5.1[-] Deleting multiple files (On Android App seems cumbersome)[-] No plans to support Android 2.x devices at this point in time[-] Does not support exFAT based high capacity SDXC cards at this point in time[-] Windows 7 & higher app support is very basic at this moment but might improve?Lyve seems to have gone above and beyond to mask the nitty gritty techie details so that this solution is made to fit everyone's needs and the process of setup is very simple and it does work but you will have to understand that content aggregation does take time initially and you will learn that if you have a large collection of photos to begin with then you will see it will takes hours or days depending on how many files you need to transfer to the device.My one important suggestion would be to make all the photos you currently have properly organized first (you may need to tweak the file's date and time) before you allow the apps to gather it from your various devices so that it does not screw up the timeline in the way it will appear later since it maintains the all that on the LyveHome (I learnt it the hard way) Also, if you want peace of mind that your personal data is 'double-safe' you can make a 'mirror' copy of your photo & video files by buying two of the same product and keep one in work and one at home - problem solved :) freedom from cloud services (If you hate them since they offer limited storage space for free or charge outrageous fees for large storage space)Overall impression was very good, But I was sort of disappointed later during the testing of the product that it does not work until it gets connected to internet and wants to be connected to internet (*MUST* have access to Lyvehome servers) at all times even for transferring files locally (Wired or wireless) (This beats me!) It just simply does not work in private LANs. Also, I did have some issues during the product testing especially with Windows XP SP3 based old PC where most of my old photos & videos are kept and I had to contact customer support for assistance. They were courteous and responsive but I learnt that they have *no plans* (as of yet) to support Windows XP based PCs since their window client app runs with .NET 4.5.1 framework. Also, at the current moment theLyve Appis *only* compatible with Kindle Fire Generation 2 or better. It is incompatible with other tablets & phones that are Android 4.1 and higher registered to Amazon App-store. This could be Amazon App-store issue which lyve will eventually fix. Currently, if you have other Android based tablets and phones you are suggested to get the free Lyve app from Google Play services which works fine as long as your tablet or phone is Android 4.1 and higher.Edit (June 29 2014):--------------------Initially I had rated this 4 stars, But after using it more I found some limitations (See more CONs) and thus Loses one star combined since the windows client app support is very basic at this point in time and close to being worthless. Also, it does not work in Private local LAN and needs access to internet at all times.Disclosure: Before you like or dislike my review I would like to disclose that I received this Product from Amazon for free in exchange for an unbiased review for fellow Amazon shoppers.

It should be named the LyveHome Photo and Video storage device, it doesn't manage much. It is a very compact device, just about the same screen size as my Samsung S4 and only about 4 inches deep so it take up very little space wherever you may place it. The set-up was very easy, step by step on screen instructions and you are set up in about a minute.The issue I have with the device is that it is all or nothing for syncing your photos. As soon as you connect your device to the LyveHome all of your photos sync, you have no option to choose which photos you can upload. If you want to delete photos from the device, you have to go to the on-line app to do so, and it only works with iOS at the moment. Once deleted from the on-line app you then have to remove the photos from your phone that you do not want on the LyveHome device. You would think for $300 a user would have the flexibility to pick and choose what photos they wanted to sync. Also - the photos scroll by and you cannot stop on just one photo and when you turn the device on it's side to look at a photo that was taken in landscape, the screen does not move.I spoke with one of the customer service reps about the lack of customization and he said they were &#34;working on it&#34; but had no time table. Over all, a pretty screen and great if you want every single photo you have on your device (s) synced. For me, and for $300 I would wait for better, more flexible software.","rating":2},{"comment":"I've been playing the LyveHome for a few days now, and it has been an eye-opening and exciting experience.  I've given it 4 stars because while the system is great, it is not yet perfect.  Below is a brief list of pros & cons list, and below that is a long-winded, rambling recap of my experiences with the LyveHome.Summary:Pros:&#10004; Reviewing images on a tablet is simply amazingly.  The ability to see decades worth of images in just seconds is the main PRO of this system.  The Lyve will send you on an emotional roller coaster as you relive all the precious\/heartbreaking moments in your life.&#10004; Images and Videos are easy to load on the LyveHome. (note: can't play videos on Kindle device)&#10004; Syncing iOS, Android, and windows devices to the LyveHome is a snap.&#10004; On devices with a lot of cache, the low-res version of the photos are still accessible when the device is off-line (no wi-fi or cellular).&#10004; Automatically transfers any new pictures found on any synced devices to the LyveHome.Cons:&#10008; It is a slow and laborious process to load images from a PC to the LyveHome. It will take days or weeks depending on your collection.&#10008; No documentation included in the box.  You need to go to the website to find out how to begin.&#10008; Small size of the display screen on the LyveHome makes it impossible to use as a Digital Photo Frame.&#10008; No way to back up the LyveHome.  Since all my pictures from all my sources could theoretically be on the LyveHome, it would be nice if I could copy everything from the LyveHome to the Cloud or to an external hard drive that could be kept an extra copy in a separate location.&#10008; The Lyve App on Windows is ONLY for loading images to the LyveHome.  You can't look at the Lyve images using a PC.  The load app also doesn't give much in the way of feedback.  It tells you how many images still need to be loaded but no estimate of how long it will take.  The PC app needs a lot of work to make it more user-friendly.&#10008; Can't load TIFF images.&#10008; Can't play .MOV and .AVI movies stored in LyveHome on the Kindle devices.Wish List:I wish the Kindle\/Android app had functionality that would let display the images in a rolling format.  Also have a timer that allowed you to start and stop the display at set times.  With these simple tweaks you could turn your Kindle into a digital photo frame.--------------------------------------------------------------------Below is the long-winded version of my review.  Read on If you are a glutton for punishment...At first I was doubtful about this new-fangled LyveHome.  I have a collection of digital photos that probably exceeds 100,000 images.  I have 80 years' worth of photos (mine, my dad's and my grandparents) store on my PC, carefully arranged in folders and routinely backed up and stored in multiple locations.  What could the LyveHome do that I wasn't doing already?When I first opened the box containing the LyveHome system I was a little perplexed.  The box contained just a white cube, a power cord, and a tiny card that said plug in the Lyve Home  and follow the onscreen instructions.  No introduction, no manual, no quick-start guide.  I plugged the Lyve in, connected it to my network, and created an account... but now what?  I was uncertain what to do next.  The LyveHome was displaying some pretty \"Sample\" photos, but there were no instruction on how to load my photos.  The lack of any kind of manual in the box was annoying.  Finally I accessed the Lyve website, went to the support page, and downloaded the Windows app to my PC.  First off the app needed to know which picture folders I wanted synced to the LyveHome.  I have hundreds of photo folders, and the first big frustration with the Windows app was that you had to select one folders at a time.  I couldn't hold the shift down and selection multiple.  What a pain.  So I selected three folders (about 4000 pictures total, ~600KB each, all taken with my first 4Mgpixel camera), and told the app to load.  Then I waited, and waited, and waited some more.  In the end it took about four hours for the LyveHome to do its thing, and during that time there wasn't much communication from the app telling you what was going on.During the first 30 minutes of the load the Status screen on the Windows app told me it was \"Collecting\" my images.  After about an hour it started to actually load the images to the LyveHome box.  After about 50 images where loaded the display on the LyveHome was still showing me the Sample photos.  I had to do more digging on the Lyve website to figure out how to change from the Sample photos to my photos.  Finally my photos started start scrolling across the LyveHome's display screen.  The screen on the LyveHome is only about 2-1\/2 x 4-1\/2\", and 3 images are scrolling across the screen at any given time.  I had hoped to use the LyveHome as a pseudo digital photo frame, but the images were too small and the constant scrolling gave me a headache.  In the end I just turned off the display.At this point I started to poke around with the Windows app.  I wanted to look under the hood of the LyveHome and see how my photos were being arranged.  But the Lyve Windows app was pretty useless.  Apparently the only thing the app does is load the photos from your PC onto the LyveHome.  You can't use the Windows app to look at the photos on the Lyve Home.  At this point I wasn't very impressed.But then I loaded the Lyve app onto my Kindle HDX, waited a few minutes for the Kindle to sync with the LyveHome, and then WOW.  Let me say it again WOW!!!I opened the app and saw three rows of pictures positioned vertically above a horizontal line of dates (1998-2000). I used my fingers to zoom out on the visible pictures and saw more pictures!  The more I zoomed the more pictures I saw.  Finally I zoomed in enough so that the pictures were arranged in calendar format with each picture sitting in the location that represented the date it was taken.  When I touched a picture on a given date it zoomed to that date and showed a grid (with tiny thumbnails) of all the pictures taken on that day.  Touching one of the pictures in the grid caused it to display in full screen mode.  Swipe to see the next picture taken on that day.  It was so quick, so responsive, there was absolutely no lag.  Granted the images were not being displayed in their native resolution, but the resolution of the thumbnails was pretty impressive considering the huge volume of images that were being displayed at once.  I was mesmerized as I swiped back and forth through the pictures.  Each day thatI accessed brought up a flood of memories.  The pictures were summary of my life that I could access with just a touch of a finger.  I was in awe.I dashed to my PC, selected three more folders to load to the LyveHome and then went to bed. The next day I didn't have time to open my Kindle till I got to my  car pool.  I didn't know what to expect.  There is no WiFi during the commute, and my Kindle didn't have a cellular plan.  I opened the app and to my surprise and utter delight the Kindle showed me ALL of the pictures.  Even though I had no Wi-Fi or cellular connection on my Kindle, I was still seeing 8,000+ photos.  How was that possible!  I checked the stats on the app and it was only using 18.60MB of data and 430 MB of Cache.  What kind of magic, hocus-pocus, voodoo is this?  Even at the lower resolution how could the Lyve squeeze 8000 pictures into 430 MB of cache?  As a test I cleared the Cache on the Kindle, and poof, all the images disappeared.  No Wi-Fi in the car so the pictures couldn't be accessed downloaded again.Next I loaded the Lyve app onto my iPhone 4S, but it wasn't as impressive as the Kindle. The app functionally is the same on both devices, but on the Kindle all the pictures were loaded into Cache so they were immediately visible whereas on the iPhone all I saw where blank placeholders where the pictures should be.  When I touched one of the blank placeholders the request was routed through the Lyve servers to my LyveHome which sent back a copy of the real image.  All this routing takes time, and consumes MB from my phone's data plan.  The idea that a few requests from the Lyve app could eat up my phone's entire month's data allotment had me quickly turning off the Lyve app's cellular access.When I got home that afternoon the Kindle connected to the Wi-Fi and immediately started redisplaying the photos.  It took it about 20 minutes to redisplay all the pictures, and it also completely drained the power from my Kindle.Next I queued up a few more folders of pictures to load, but this time the average size of the pictures was 6000KB.  As you can expect the transfer speed was greatly reduced.  With these larger photos I was averaging about 175 image transfers an hour.  It took about 30 hours to transfer this set of images from my PC to the LyveHome.I also loaded pictures straight from my camera's SD card to the LyveHome.  Talk about FAST.  It took about 3 minutes to transfer 350 photos from the card to the LyveHome.  Why can't the PC to LyveHome transfer work that fast.  Guess it is the Wi-Fi that is the bottleneck.Now I'm in the process of loading all my photos to the LyveHome just to see how my Kindle handles the volume.  I'm not sure how to handle my old, scanned photos.  They all have the date that the scan was made and not the date that the photo was taken.  The old photos are arranged in folders corresponding to the date they were taken, but the folder structure is not preserved in the LyveHome.  I guess I'm going to have to changing the true date associated with each image before I load them to the LyveHome.So how is Lyve better than Dropbox or the Cloud?  Well for one you don't have to manually transfer anything.  If a picture is taken on any of  the synced phones,  tablets, or PCs they are automatically moved to the LyveHome and then synced to all available devices.  Also the photo review method is easier on the Lyve app (when using a tablet) then it is with the Cloud.  You also have the advantage of looking at your photos off-line (as long as you have enough cache on your device).So the bottom line is I love the new Lyve system, but I will love it more when I can sync a Digital Photo Frame to the LyveHome box.********************************Update 7-1-2014:I've been experimenting with the transfer of my historic photos to LyveHome, and as suspected I do need to edit the Windows date stamp associated with each picture before putting the picture in a folder that Lyve is monitoring.  No real surprise here.But something that was a surprise is that the LyveHome doesn't recognize TIFF format.  So now I must also convert all my scanned tiff images to jpeg. It looks like the Window Lyve app tries to catalogue and transfer the tiffs, but nothing ever shows up on the LyveHome side.The LyveHome also has an issue with the scans that are in portrait mode.  On my Kindle's Lyve app the full screen version of my picture looks fine, but the thumbnail version is cropped so that you only see the center portion of the image.  I have a lot of studio portraits and in the Lyve thumbnails all you see is the torso of the person, the head and face is not displayed in the thumbnail.  This makes it very difficult to quickly find the picture you are interested in viewing.  I guess I will have to rotate the tiffs to landscape before I convert it to jpeg.  Or if already a portrait jpeg, I can use the rotate option in Window's Previewer.The final issue is with the display of the pictures in the Time Line Mode.  I started loading my oldest scanned pictures first, so now in LyveHome I have pictures in the 1902 bucket and then the next set is in 1998.  As yet there are no pictures in the years 1903-1997, but the Time Line still shows a column for each empty year.  It takes repeated swipes of the screen to move from one end of the time line to the other.  If would be nice if these empty time buckets were compressed or not shown at all.Finally a new Wish List item.  It would be nice if I could associate a comment with the photo.  On my very old scanned photos I put the name of the subject in the file name, but it would be nice to have a place in Lyve where you could document the people, place, and circumstance of the photo.","rating":4},{"comment":"This has been a great product for me so far because I have multiple computers and tablets filled with pictures and 2 GB of storage for this type of media is a LOT. There are armies of photos you want to keep around, too, and you really do not think of how easy it is to lose years of experiences simply by having some unfortunate calamity such as a crash. I like having something that is dedicated to my pictures, and it does feel good to have them in one easy-to-access place. It also felt good going through them, because there are armies of pictures I had forgotten about and it felt good seeing people who have since been lost or have grown up. I also like the idea of not having to pay to store my pictures on some digital service, because that gets expensive. They are worth it, sure, but monthly charges get old. Synching devices to this thing was really easy, and reviewing via a device is also pretty simple. I also like the idea of a digital frame, and I am not someone who thought they would ever type that.There are some downsides to this as well. For one, it would be nice to be able to go through and select pictures easily but this system is mainly a date search engine. The price is kind of high as well, and it takes FOREVER to load from your PC to the device. I think more control would be nice, period.All-in-all, a nice thing to have but read up on the downsides first to make an informed decision. If they sound good to you, you are picking up something that is nice to use and can make days or even weeks of reviewing extremely worthwhile.","rating":5},{"comment":"I don't know if this is the final answer for all of our photo and video storage, but so far it is the best out there.Reasons:1)  First for me was privacy, no &#34;we changed our 3,000 page terms of use&#34; that always seems to give someone the right to use your image for their purposes. The images are on my device, they do not keep copies of your data, nor do they have access to your devices data.2)  No monthly fees. Everyone wants to charge me $5, $10, $100 per year, month, week, day, etc...3) No fear of the dreaded &#34;going out of business&#34;, &#34;sold to Dowey, Cheetum and How!&#34; or Apple's &#34;moving in a different direction, no longer going to provide that service (can you say @mac.com or @me.com? How long will @icloud.com be around? btw I like Apple products, just don't like all of their policies).Initial setup is pretty quick and easy on the device. In my case no router reconfiguring was required even with 3 units running (more on that later).You can install the app into your iOS and Andriod devices as well as your computer. Once installed it will ask if you would like to upload your camera roll to the device, which it will do very nicely. The mobile apps can automatically upload all of your photos and videos as you take them (if you've got the cellular option turned on otherwise it waits until you have a WiFi connection) and also keeps thumbnails of the entire library on the device only downloading the full image\/video when you select it to see in detail or view the video.For the mobile apps you can view a detail (day by day with 4 changing images per day) or a timeline view (really cool if your images have correct dates and times).The computer version is lacking compared to the mobile, but this is a new product so I am willing to be patient. Currently it only has the detail (day by day) view. You can upload your iPhoto library (depending upon the size this may take hours or days). You can also configure it to monitor specific folders and when a new image goes into one of those folders (or a sub folder) then it is automatically uploaded (assuming that you leave the Lyve application open).2 terabytes for most people should be sufficient for quite a while, but backups are a concern. Currently the only methods of backing the device up are to purchase a second unit which will clone the first (until the first is full and then it becomes a second 2 TB of storage rather than a backup) or to manually backup one day at a time from the computer by using the copy to command. The clone is seamless and allows you to have multiple backups at different locations, but all in all I would prefer a &#34;real&#34; backup like CrashPlan or an option to hook up an external USB drive to the device to make a copy of all files.So, why 3? One is my master, the second is a clone of it (hooked up at a friend's house just in case something happens to my house). The third is setup with a different account so that I and my family can share photos. It is kind of a pain to have 2 &#34;accounts&#34; and I am hoping that they will come out with an update that will allow a more elegant option, but since I don't want the family to see all of my photos and I really don't want to see 500 photos of little nephew Johnny this method works for the time being.","rating":4},{"comment":"I love that this comes with built in cables for charging both the power bank and a micro usb device.  It's a nice small power bank that has a nice feel to it and allows you to leave the cables at home. (like I frequently forget to bring...)","rating":5},{"comment":"This is just about the most perfect style and size of powerbank battery made. The battery is slightly thicker than an iPhone 4s, about the same length, and a little narrower. Everything is rounded over and the body is made of a soft matte finish plastic. This is the perfect battery pack to put in a pocket along with a phone. The permanently attached USB cables (male rectangular for charging the battery and a microUSB for charging devices) are a great addition.The capacity is exactly spot on for a 6000 mAh battery - it will fully charge an iPhone 4s at the extra high rate of charge. I actually charged my phone from 33% up to 100% and then the remaining battery gave my iPad Air a 33% charge. So it will deliver just over a 100% charge on an iPhone 4s.Simplicity is the word with this battery. There are four blue LEDs on the end to show charge status, two USB ports to use your own cable (30 pin or lightning cable for Apple products), and a microUSB port to charge the battery. The battery charges quickly with a standard 1 Amp USB port. You can use a computer port or AC adapter to charge the battery (an AC adapter is not included in the box).I have reviewed a ton of rechargeable battery packs. This one is right up there with the best. Form factor and the soft plastic material are its major selling points.I was provided a review sample.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a great little accessory that is a must have with any iPhone.

Now the product details say that you can charge an Iphone 5 up to 2.5 times. I consistently get 3.5 charges- BUT-  I start charging at 21%. I never wait for the phone to get red.The unit charges fast, I just plug it in over night and throw it in my bag in the morning. I have no issues with heat or syncing.

A separate cable is also included plus mini USB, 30-pin Apple, and Nokia connectors.The power bank was delivered fully charged and recharges overnight in any powered USB port or wall or auto charger.  It has a four-LED capacity display in 25% increments, both 1.0 and 2.1 A ports, and smart circuitry.The 6,000 mAh battery will provide at least 4,800 mAh of usable capacity, using a conservative 80% efficiency factor.

Instead, I rely on power banks like this one by Eachine.  I love the embedded cables - one for charging the power bank itself, the other for charging devices with micro USB ports.  Also included are two USB ports, just in case our devices use some other connector, like a 30-pin connector or mini USB.  I've been able to make use of all of them to charge three devices at once.  Yes, it can!  I have it hooked right now to a 7\" Android tablet, a Kindle Fire HD 8.9\" tablet and a 9\" Android tablet.Mostly, I use the power bank for my phone.  After giving it one full charge, it still has 3 out of 4 lights lit.  That's impressive.No fingerprint magnet here.  It's matte black, with a soft, creamy texture.This is an ideal power bank for larger cell phone users.  It's not too big but it still packs a punch, and the embedded cables are a convenient plus.

It also includes a separate microUSB cable and connector tips for 30-pin Apple devices, miniUSB and Nokia.Other than the lousy packaging, it is a nice looking power bank that is very portable. Size and shape is just perfect to throw in your purse for some emergency power when you need it.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.","rating":4},{"comment":"I gathered quite the crowd when I pulled this out at work. Everyone was amazed by it. My boss even grabbed it and went from office to office showing everyone! This is easily one of the nicest backup batteries we have seen.First off, it looks nice. It is sleek and colorful. (I got orange!) It has a clean modern design.Once you pick it up, it feels nice. It is coated with a rubber like stuff that is soft and grippy, but durable.Of course, no one buys a backup battery for its design. You need it to work, and work it does! It will charge my Iphone 5 almost 3 times. That is a lot of power! Also, it can charge multiple devices at once. It charges just as fast as my wall charger. I doesn;t just charge phones, it will charge just about anything that charges from a USB cable.The design is great. It has a USB cable to charge it built in, and a charging cable for your device built in. These hide cleverly in the side of the backup battery.There is an indicator light that flashes as it is being charged and stops flashing at full charge, a nice touch.It is slightly longer and thicker than my Iphone 5. It has weight, but is in no way heavy. I would guess that is is about twice as heavy as my Iphone.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Eachine Ultra-slim X3 charger makes me happy.  It's so light and compact, about the size of a cell phone, that you could tuck it into your pocket for emergency charges.  It has a smooth, sure-grip surface, and built in USB and Micro B plugs so that you never have to carry an extra cord for charging.  It also comes with three extra charging tips, a Mini B, an Apple, and a Nokia.It doesn't have the power that the bigger chargers do, it's good for one, maybe two short charges of my phone.  But it charges and recharges quickly.  The color of the case is quite wonderful, too.","rating":4},{"comment":"I should love this battery - the form factor is wonderful, a % charge number, two USB ports, a small LED flashlight, and a large capacity - 10,400 mAh, all great things. Overall, it is a good battery.I have used more batteries than anybody should ever use, way too many. Eachine makes really good batteries; I love their little round flashlight style batteries and their flat pocket able 6000 mAh battery. This 10,400 mAh batteries kind of fall a little bit short for me. And I'm talking about details here, not major issues.The capacity is a little lower than I expected. It will only do about 66% of a full charge on an iPad Air. I've charged my iPad several times and only end up getting about 2\/3 of a charge (33% to 100%, 23% to 95%, 8% to 75%). I expect a 10,400 mAh battery to give me 100% of a charge on an iPad Air (8,800 mAh battery). This battery doesn't charge my iPad at a consistent rate. At the start it charges very slowly, at almost trickle rate. After an hour or so, it picks up to the high charge rate. Most batteries this size will charge that the super high rate the whole way.The display drives me kind of crazy. For some reason I always want to hold this battery upside down and read the % charge display upside down - it confuses me. I've done this now for weeks and can't figure out why I'm always reading it the wrong way. Something about the design makes me hold it the wrong way around.There are two USB ports, so two devices can be charged at once. You have 2 Amps to split between the two ports. This will work great with cell phones. I wouldn't try charging an iPad and an iPhone at the same time - it will just take too long.Sadly it takes a really long time for the battery to charge via the microUSB port. A battery this capacity should charge from 0% to 100% overnight - this takes about 4 or 5 hours more than overnight.For adding a bit of charge to a tablet, this isn't a bad battery. I wish it charged faster, could deliver a higher rate of charge, and could charge my iPad to 100% from fully dead.I was provided a review sample.Eachine Blue 3000mAh Portable Backup External Battery Lip-stick Power Bank ChargerEachine Black Ultra-slim 6000mah Portable Backup External Battery Three USB Ports Power Bank with Inside Charger Cable","rating":4},{"comment":"I was pleasantly surprised with this external battery pack. Here's what I like:- It looks really nice in person. It has a great matte finish and feels solid and well-built.-At 10,400mAh, the battery capacity is huge!-For this size of battery, the price is great.-I like that you can charge both an iPad and an iPhone at the same time.And finally...This is made with a Samsung battery, which many of the expensive name-brand packs are made with as well. So this is a great way to get the great batteries, without having to pay for marketing and branding... after all, for the most part, a battery is a battery.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have quite a few of these external battery packs, and this is probably one of the nicest ones that I have reviewed.  In terms of size, most of them scale with the size of the battery.  This one is 5.5&#34; long, 2.4&#34; wide, and 0.75&#34; deep, but is able to hold a whopping 10400 mAH which is enough to charge a phone a few times or an iPad about 1.5 times.  The battery has a nice finish on the outside and feels very high quality, with a beveled edge which makes it great to grip.  Many of these batteries have a cheap look and feel, but this one is quite well done.There are 2 normal USB ports for supplying power, one for 2.1A and the other for 1A.  I was able to charge both my iPad and iPhone simultaneously from it.  There is a nice blue backlit LCD display to tell you how much battery power is left.  Many of my external battery packs just used 1-4 LED's to show approximate power, so this LCD display is appreciated.  The adapter also comes with a slew of adapters as well to help you connect it up.  Topping it off, there is a built-in white LED light, a nice feature.I was carrying a much larger 15000mAH battery, but I never used the whole thing, so I think this much smaller battery will become my new battery of choice for the size and utility.  It packs the most punch into the smallest package.Note: I received a free sample from the manufacturer for the purposes of review.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a very nice portable external battery. I received this as a review sample. First of all, it's a 10400mAh battery, which means it will charge your phone about 3 times (even accounting for conversion losses) and a large device like an iPad once.For a battery which such a large capacity it's small and handy. It's got two charge ports, one at 1.0A and one at 2.1A so you can charge two devices at once. It's also got a LCD readout so you can see how much battery is left. Lastly it has a nifty LED flashlight.It measures 5.5\" x 2.5\" x 7\/8\" which means it's pretty small and has a pleasing matte finish. It comes with a charging cable with an Apple 30 pin, micro and mini-USB tips.Overall, it's a small and handy large capacity battery that would be very useful when traveling to charge your mobile devices.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Samsung is very similar to the Eachine X-Power Serie X2 and contains a whopping 10,400mAh, which is a good chunk of power - enough to charge most Smartphone's about five times and an iPad at least twice (fully). 10,000 mAh is really the minimum you want in a power bank. Anything less will have to going back to your computer or electrical outlet to keep recharging. The small hand-size (approximately 5.5\" X 2.5\" X 1\") is great for packing.This power bank also holds a charge for several weeks at least. The power bank weighs a meager 8.6 ounces. It also comes with a small emergency flashlight which is fairly powerful, but using this light will eat up your battery power quickly.  It is nearly universally compatible with just about any electronic device.This device also includes two ports for charging; simultaneously if wanted. One is a 5V\/2.1A for Android and Apple devices and the other is a 5V\/1.0A charge for most other devices.  In between these ports is the Micro-USB port for charging - the power cord is included along with extra adapters for other electronic devices.  These are all on the narrower side.  The emergency light is on the top narrow edge of the unit.This battery pack is unique, in that, it displays the power in exact digital increments up to 99% (1% - 99%). That means no guessing from 20%, 40%, 80% or whatever. You know exactly how much power is left. I prefer this much more than a power bank that has, let's say, four LED lights that represent 25% each. With this battery, you know exactly how much power you have and how fast you are using it up.  It's a nice bright blue on the white background on the wide side of the unit with an On\/Off button next to it.I would suggest looking at all types of power banks\/battery packs to see which one works best for you, as all are different with groups of attachments or simpler. Some have smaller charge capacities and some are larger (like this one). It all depends on what devices you have and how often you charge. Also, check the prices on all batteries and the power! This will make things a lot easier in charging any external battery. I like this power bank more than most I own simply for its small size and big power. This product was supplied by the manufacturer for an honest review.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a big capacity 10,400 mAh power bank with two USB charging slots.  One slot rated at 1.0A for cell phones and other small electronics, and the other 2.1A for tablets and iPads. It also incorporates an LED lamp for use as an emergency flashlight.The cool thing about this power pack is the LCD panel that gives you exactly how much juice is left in percentage.  It also gives you feedback which slot is being used, the 2.1A or 1A.  To turn on the flashlight, quickly press the button two times - do the same to turn it off.Included is a microUSB cable and several adapter tips.  Also included are 30-pin Apple connector, a miniUSB and a Nokia adapter, and a short manual. Made in China.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.","rating":4},{"comment":"I have had a ton of &#34;Power Banks&#34; pass my way over the last 12 months. The reality is that every one that has crossed my path has been able to charge my Lumia 1020, my old Blackberry and my iPhone 5s without problem. I've had varying capacities and so on.The Eachine is definitely one of the nicer ones I've received. What helps make it stand out is the fact that, like very few others I've had, there is a nice LCD display to show you the actual percentage of battery power left in the Power Bank. Usually you just get a few lights to indicate, never really knowing just how much of that final light really is left and if you need to recharge now, or after one more cycle. No more guessing here.The other nice thing is the price for a 10,400 mAh external battery with the LCD capability. Definitely sets this one out above some of the others I've had and still have.Also making this one stand out is the included tips. None of the others I've used in this price range have offered a USB Micro to USB mini plug adapter. To be clear, this would make your micro USB cable plug into a mini-USB chargeable device. It also includes Micro USB to the older style iOS charger (no lightning included). There is also a Nokia adapter for older Nokia phones, though I can't test that one out. Still, usually you just get a cable to charge the Power Bank.The capacity of 10,400, given the general efficiency for recharging, will net you roughly 5.5 - 6 full charges of an iPhone 5s. My Lumia 1020 will get 4-5 recharges. This is about normal for all Power Banks. Physics be darned!Also nice is that you can charge 2 devices at once. It isn't recommended to charge 2 devices AND charge the Power Bank at the same time as this can affect, negatively, the life expectancy of the Power Bank itself.When it comes to portability, this one isn't too bad. 10,400 mAh worth of batteries inside means it's kinda heavy, but not overly so. It can easily fit in your back pocket or hand bag for an emergency charge if needed.It also includes a flashlight. It's bright enough to see in the dark, but it's not great.Overall, this is a great power bank with some good features that sets it above the pack.Highly recommended.I received a free sample for review purposes from the manufacturer.","rating":5},{"comment":"This thing is totally cool. It will charge your Iphone 5 five times. I didn't believe it at first, but I tried it. It is true. This backup battery has that much capacity!In addition to its high capacity it can charge two things at once, has a battery percentage gauge, and a flashlight!The flashlight is a single LED. Perfect for looking for something in a dark hotel room without disturbing anyone. I have a feeling you could keep the flashlight on for a very long time. Every time I use it, the battery does not go down noticeably at all.If you live in an area with frequent power outages, then this is a must! It will give you DAYS of power for your cell phone. Actually, it will charge any device that charges via a USB cable. So, cameras and tablets can be charged by it too.It is fairly large, about the size of an unfolded wallet. Maybe an inch thick. It has some weight, batteries are heavy and this charger has four of them, but not super heavy.This is easily the best backup battery I have every seen!","rating":5},{"comment":"A bit on the larger side, and with a capacity of 10,400mAh (10.4A), the Eachine X-Power X1 external battery is probably best suited for those with devices that consume higher levels of power, like certain smart phones, tablets like the iPad, and e-book readers like the Kindle Fire.When the power is turned on, a blue LED indicates the percentage of charge available.  There are two USB output ports, one rated at 1A, and a second at 2.1A for higher output devices.  An LED that serves as a flashlight, is becoming almost a standard item on power banks, and the X1 has one as well.  When recharging another device, the LCD indicates whether the output is 1.0A or 2.1A, and there is circuitry in the X1 that turns the power off to prevent overcharging.To achieve the higher capacity, much of the unit is devoted to batteries, which makes it larger and heavier than most battery banks.  Recharge time is stated as 10 hours, and that&#8217;s a little optimistic, as even with an input of 2 amps, it can take longer than 12 hour, to recharge from 30% or less, back up to 100%.  If you are headed off on a trip lasting several days, be sure to allow enough time to fully recharge the unit.  The LCD should also help to insure that you don&#8217;t run short of recharging power.I was provided a sample for evaluation, and if high capacity is a primary concern, the X1, or theEachine X-Power X2, which is very similar, could be an a solid choice, as long as you are prepared for the larger size, and weight, as these units are not the most convenient to carry.  No pouch is provided, but a cord with accessory connectors is included.  The cost is on the higher side, so you would want to be very sure that you require this much power before you buy.","rating":5},{"comment":"Excellent charger, able to hold power a long time and energize in about the same time as when I plug my HTC One M& smartphone and my Kindle Touch into an AC outlet. I tried this as asked on both to compare to other power banks. At 10400 mAh this is hefty, but does not weigh that much. Its plastic container is easily held in the hand and is about the same dimensions in length and breadth as my phone, and the width is just barely bigger than a USB plug's width.It can rest tilted up if necessary in a small space. It is heavy enough to stand upright, but most people will lay it on its side. One edge is to power itself with the USB mini-to USB plug. The other has two ports for charging, both USB (adapters are provided...).The readout is easy to see and while blue, shuts to a power-saving mode in a few seconds if not pressed or activated while the charge happens. It arrived at 100% charge, a thoughtful touch. It took about 2.5 hours for my phone and I tried this at a demanding pace, blasting my music and streaming songs and searching for the same while it charged, to test its performance. The charger, like I said, powered a phone at 16% to 100% in the same time as an AC charge under the circumstance, and went from 100% to 75% over that period.I then used the charger as is to charge a nearly drained Kindle Touch, both on the 1.0 port (a 2.1 is also provided, and adapters for Apple are also included as plugs, again a feature many power banks do not add). The Kindle charged (this time I did not use it while charging) in the same time of 1.5+ hours as usual with AC. The charger for comparison went from 75% to 67%.So, this matches in DC the AC speeds at the 1.0 port for two items I charge a lot. Glad to see this. I recommend it for reliability.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Samsung is similiar to the X-Power X1 and contains a whopping 10,400mAh, which is a good chunk of power - enough to charge most Smartphone's about five times and an iPad at least twice (fully). 10,000 mAh is really the minimum you want in a power bank.

It may not easily fit in a pants pocket or small purse, but does in a backpack and it provides a lot of spare power when you are away from the grid or access to outlets is problematic.Last year it would have been one of the higher capacity batteries on the market, but this year it is in the mid range. For me and probably ninety percent of other users this is not an issue because 10400mAh is a lot of spare capacity. Before proceeding I want to let you know that I always multiply new battery packs by .9 to get a more realistic capacity. That's because there are some losses in efficiency from heat, the transfer process, condition of your charging cable and myriad other factors. Using my quick formula you can expect about 9360mAh from this battery. What this means in real life is if you are using an Apple iPhone 5S with a stock 1560mAh this will provide an additional six hundred percent of use time.  For an iPad 2 with a stock 6930mAh battery it will slightly more than double your use time.I did some quick tests with the aforementioned Apple devices, plus my Galaxy Note 3 and Tab 3 10.1, and this battery pack simultaneously charged up the pair of Apples, then did the same for the pair of Samsungs - and did so as quickly as when I was using OEM chargers plugged into the wall. That is impressive because there is usually some latency when charging from a battery, but I did not notice any appreciable difference.One of the feature that I love is the real LED display that shows exactly how much capacity is remaining down to the one percent. This is a vast improvement over the old style LEDs that would show increments of twenty or twenty-five percent (depending on brand and model). This has a built in flashlight too, so for camping it is a useful feature. A better set of features is the integrated circuit that prevents over charging, loading and discharging, and protects against short circuits. That gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling more than a flashlight.One final thing that impressed me is the price, which at the time of this review is around thirty bucks. A year ago battery packs with the same rated capacity were going for over three times as much, so as the technology improves the price seems to keep dropping. This model is not only priced to reflect that, but has features like the LED display that was lacking on the earlier generation of these batteries. I give this one an easy five stars for value, features and performance.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a rather big 10,400 mAh capacity power pack a compact form.  It is very plain and clean looking making it a nice companion for my son's white iPad mini.  The LED flashlight can be turned on or turned off by pressing the button twice.  The backlit LCD panel is bright and gives you the exact battery level you have remaining .  It can charge two devices at a time with 1 USB slot at 2.1A (for tablets) and another slot at 1A for cellphones and smaller electronics like MP3 player, etc.Accessories:It comes with a microUSB cable and three connector tips - 30-pin connector for older Apple devices, miniUSB and Nokia.  No 8-pin Lightning tip is included.  You use the same microUSB cable to charge the battery pack as well as for charging your devices with the connector tips.Cons:My only gripe is the poor packaging.  It could have been a nice thing to wrap as a present if it has better packaging.I am rating this 5 stars for its features, capacity, minimalistic look and affordable price (under 30$ at the time I write this review).A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.","rating":5},{"comment":"As usual I received this unit free in exchange for a review.  Despite that kindness I will be honest about it below.Over the last few months I've reviewed a dozen of these portable power units and I've taken every single one of them to work to give away.

This one seems to have joined together all the key features I've wanted.* Nice sleek design that fits well in the hand.* Digital readout of remaining capacity and current charging status* Built-in flashlight so it's not JUST a battery but also a handy emergency device* Dual outputs in 3.1 or 1.0A and tied for the highest capacity battery I've seen* Comes with a cord with interchangeable heads for various device types from iPhone to US* Handy on\/off button to conserve powerIn summary, this is the only battery I've seen that I'll be keeping for myself.

This one is better than all of them........ combined!It holds an enormous amount of power. They claim it can charge an Iphone 5 up to 5 times. This is not an exaggeration, if anything it is an understatement. Basically, with careful usage, you can have a weeks worth of cell phone power in the palm of your hand. I live in a hurricane prone area, so this is a big comfort.The battery percentage indicator is a nice touch. No more guessing how much power you have left.

I think they should all have this feature.It charges my devices as fast as they charge from the wall charger.The housing looks rugged and well made. It is about the size of a checkbook, only an inch thick. It is fairly heavy, but not so heavy that you would want to leave it home.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Eachine 10400mAh is for all intents and purposes exactly the same as Eachine's 7800mAh battery... except more powerful and only a few bucks more.Both have several selling points: bright LCD backlit screen displaying current battery level and status, two USB outputs, and most importantly, an internal power regulating chip which prevents overcharging, overloading, short circuits, etc. The side flashlight function is bright enough for spotlight illumination in dark environments.The unit weighed at 8.7 ounces, and it has some heft to it. Not really something you will slip into a pocket, but certainly light enough for backpack traveling.  The rectangular shape also will fit nicely into large purses.  I have uploaded a photo of the 10400mAh pack next to a PSP 3000 so you can get a relative sense of size.The packaging instructions specifically state it is compatible with:Various lighting Apple Products (but use the original Apple Lightning to USB cable) as well as a specific 30 pin adaptor provided for iPhone 3, 4, and 4S, HTC Phones, Samsung Phones, Blackberry, Motorola, Nokia (comes with the specific DC2.0 connector), LG, Sony, Google Nexus 7 and Nexus 10, Amazon Kindle Fire HD DX and other kindles, and others such as the Nook Tablet, Portable WiFi, and the PSP (NOT the PS Vita).Although not listed in the instructions, the on-site description does state that this power bank is NOT COMPATIBLE with The iPod Nano, Samsung and Asus tablets and a few other sundry GPS\/Bluetooth devices. Which is unfortunate as I have a Samsung Tab 3, and yes, I tried... and no, it does not work reliably with the Tab 3. However, I cannot hit on that as it does specifically state that it isn't supported. I also tried it out on an iPod Nano, which did charge to full, yet the LCD screen did not register the discharge rate. So take note that the few categories it doesn't support, they apparently mean it.Now in reference in particular to the PSP, this power bank does not come with the requisite 5v adapter, but USB to 5v charging cables for the PSP are available here on Amazon and will work with this power bank. I bought aData & Power USB Cable for Sony PSPand used it with this battery pack like a charm even while playing games or video on it.  The pack charged up the PSP 300, which was completely dead, to full in about an hour with only 7% of it's juice.  Now I can play my power hungry Final Fantasy games with impunity!I also tested the power bank with a Portable Wi-Fi (Verizon Jetpack), a older Kindle Keyboard, both of which were recharged in a timely manner with the internal chip automatically stopping the power output when they were for all intents and purposes full.All in all, still a shame about my Samsung Tab 3 not being supported, yet this is an excellent battery.  And I have to honestly say why buy the 7800mAh model when for a few dollars more you can get this Clint Eastwood powerhouse! (I couldn't resist the pun.  :P  )-- I received this as a complimentary review product with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.  If you have any questions at all, feel free to ask!  I will be more than happy to answer, or even do a YouTube video demonstration if possible of any particular aspect you would like clarification.","rating":5},{"comment":"I am fantastically impressed with all the chargers I've received from Eachine, but the X2 is everything I could hope for in a sturdy, all-around charging device.  While it's a bit bigger and heavier than the X4, it's miles ahead of it in terms of power.  It's charged my phone a dozen times, and my Kindle Fire at least twice on one full charge.  And while the charging time for the tablet isn't nearly as fast as a direct connection, on the A2 connector, it's fast enough to make me happy.  This is the charger I would take with me on a trip.The X2, like the other Eachine chargers I've tried, comes with a USB to Micro B cord and three extra connector tips, a Mini B, an Apple, and what I believe is a Nokia connector.  It has a bright, easy-to-read LED display that shows you the remaining charge and which output you're plugged into (There's a 5V 1.0A and a 5V 2.1A.  The latter is what I use to charge my Kindle Fire.)  The display is activated when you plug in a device, or when you press the button beside it.  Press and hold  turns it off.  Press twice turns on the bright LED flashlight located just above the input, or turns the flashlight back off.Clearly a lot of thought has gone into Eachine's chargers.  They're all well-designed and versatile, but the X2 is the real workhorse of the group.  Very impressive.","rating":5},{"comment":"I was looking for a way to consolidate all my USB devices into one powered hub with the ability to switch off each port individually.

I use the USB 2.0 ports for my keyboard and mouse and I will say that when my computer goes to sleep, it does not recognize the external keyboard keypresses to wake it back up. I have to push the keyboard on my laptop to get it to come back.  I keep my USB 3.0 external hard drives plugged into this all the time and whenever I want to pull some info off of them, I just press a button and they come to life (no more keeping them on and unused or bending down to plug them in).

There is surge protection and full backward compatibility with USB 2.0 \/ 1.1.This device will find many applications in your home or office and it is especially good for traveling. Another thoughtful and advanced device form Saicoo. Grady Harp, May 14","rating":5},{"comment":"I bought the Saicoo Hub to use with the Raspberry-Pi and it is performing quite well. The USB 3.0 inputs work with USB 2.0, so in general I have a 7-port USB 2.0 device, which is exactly what I need. The unit seemed to be quality built. Having the power come in on a separate connection is the best. You don't want to be limited by the USB power available from the Hub connector. The USB to host cable might be considered short by some, but it is fine with me. In fact, the shorter the better when wrangling all the connections to a Raspberry-Pi. Long cables are a nuance. If you can direct me to a one foot HDMI cable I would appreciate it!","rating":5},{"comment":"TheSaicoo 7-port USB 3.0 Hubis one of the first products I have seen that leaves nothing to chance out of the package.  This package ships with the 7-port hub, and a 3.1A  2-port USB charger and cable for use with devices that draw lots of power (think portable hard drives).  The optional included power adapter is an amazing inclusion because it has 2 ports (1A and 2.1A) allowing you to power the hub if needed AND charge a device on the side, really smart.To the hub; it is designed with 4 USB 3.0 ports and 3 USB 2.0.  If you are wondering why would anyone want to use USB 2.0 in a day and age of USB 3.0, think about devices that often get interference with USB 3.0 like keyboard and mouse dongles.  That makes a split like this quite practical and really useful.  The on\/off buttons are great if you like to leave devices plugged into the hub, but not in use by the computer.  I use the on\/off switches often when having multiple hard drives connected and want to conserve data transfer speeds or overall power draw.Overall, I'm quite impressed with theSaicoo 7-port USB 3.0 Hub.  The product is designed with techies in mind and offers up enough external power to keep me connected worry-free.[Sample Provided For Review]","rating":5},{"comment":"Just as good as the corsair builder series as of this day.","rating":4},{"comment":"The overall quality of this power supply was superior to most supplies I have purchased in the $25-$35 price range.  It s sleek looking, and the red fan is eye catching.  Plus, for the price of a standard 400 or 450 watt PS, this gives a rated 600 watts.  This is a great supply at a great price.","rating":5},{"comment":"Installed this for my home server - installation was easy and the unit is super quiet, even with the big 120mm fan spinning.  Plenty of power and a great deal for this size power supply.  So far, so good.","rating":5},{"comment":"It has only been installed for a couple of days, but so far, so good. This unit replaced a 500 watt power supply that was about 2 years old. The computer has a solid state drive, a SATA drive and a DVD. I am using on-board video. The fan is slightly quieter than the previous one. The build quality is good, and the cables were slightly longer than normal. Unbelievable price. If it lasts, I'll will buy more Sentey power supplies.","rating":5},{"comment":"Nice and inexpensive.Quiet and enough power for a basic system.Standard plugs and connectors.Arrived fast and well packed.Should work well for most replacement PC power supplies.If you have some high end video cards that require extra power, several internal hard drives & Optical drives, you may want to get a 600 watt power supply.","rating":4},{"comment":"I bought this as a spare for a computer I thought might have a power supply problem.  Shortly after I bought this - the computer I bought it for stopped working.  I swapped in this new unit in 10 minutes and the computer was back up and running.  Great priced replacement for systems without huge video cards.  Had plenty of sata and a molex connectors for my needs.  Very light in weight and the single fan provides more cooling than the factory power supply did.  A bit louder due to the higher rpm of the fan, but not noticeable enough to complain about at all.  Can't speak to longevity, but I hope it lasts a long time.","rating":5},{"comment":"I order and have already installed the power supply that I was building for my daughter. I was very pleased with both the speed in which the order was filled and the performance of the unit. It had good number of connecters (Molex, SATA, etc.) to power all the installed parts. A great unit at a very good price.","rating":5},{"comment":"Pros:Sturdy design all around.The price!&#34;Cool&#34; color scheme... whereas most other PSUs for the price are a featureless flat gray.Cons:Not modular, so unused wires have to be tucked away.Other comments:Buying an uncommon brand name comes with usual buyer reservations, but the product construction and packaging reassured me that I made a good purchase.","rating":5},{"comment":"It tested okay, meaning it powers on and all the numbers work out. I am unimpressed with the cables. There is one set of zip ties at the end of each cable and not near the opening on the PSU. The cables were scattered everywhere and it took a short while to untangle them. That was irritating. Never have I seen any power supply arrive without the cables being properly bunched and brought together with at least a second zip tie at the base of the cables. The main board cable (largest) has a nice cable wrap on it which makes the loose cables look even worse. What a pain, and the wires are all mixed up. I do not recommend unless you are on budget and this is NOT a true 600 watt power supply. Peaks about 380.","rating":2},{"comment":"PSU came exactly as described, build quality was better than I expected and not a bad choice if you're looking for either a PSU for average workstation or a backup psu. Currently I have this running in my home server, (nothing crazy, Core2 Quad q8200 4gb ram and 2 sata hdd) and it handles it without issue. It will be on 24\/7 so I am curious as to how long it will last. I am expecting about a year of use but I won't complain if it lasts longer. My only real complaint is that one of the wires for the molex connector came out on its own. I was able to put it back in securely though and I would sort of expect that for a $30 psu.This isn't a brand that I am familiar with but it doesn't mean it's not good, time will tell and a PSU isn't something you should cheap out on so in my opinion you're taking a gamble with this product if it is something you need to depend on. For a secondary machine or a backup I would say go for it. If this is going in a machine that you need to write papers for school or something that really needs to be reliable I would stay away until more reviews pop up regarding the longevity and reliability of the item.","rating":4},{"comment":"This product was a great as described.  In fact I like the wiring better than I do my previous Corsair Builder series power supply.  I found it much easier to organize my wiring and then tie them together.  Everything appears as high quality.  Operates quietly.  Unless something changes in the near future I think I have found me a new power supply vendor. Do yourself and buy one. No need to pay more.","rating":5},{"comment":"Needed an inexpensive power supply to replace one in my aging desktop system, but didn't need a top of the line unit.  There are probably quieter ones, but the noise does not seem excessive to me. Went with this based on ratings, and am glad I did. If it goes out, I will update the review, but I am definitely satisfied.","rating":5},{"comment":"Received within 48 hours of placing the order. (Prime).  This P\/S is absolutely perfect for my system.  Well built, quiet in operation and meets all necessary specs even for full-size ATX motherboard..  I'll buy this one again if I need another replacement.  Has all the required connectors too.  A winner!","rating":5},{"comment":"The PSU seems nice enough, although that the power switch never worked. It looks cooler in the picture than it will in your case since most likely the red fan will be behind something. I'm told they are coming out with an LED-fan version which should be nice if they keep it at a good price point.The fan is nice and quiet, the black housing is so much nicer than bare metal and overall it doesn't look cheep.UPGRADE: I replaced the fan with an Antec TrueQuiet 120mm RED fan. The PSU doesn't automatically adjust the fan speed (2-pin connector) and I found that the Cooler Master JetFlo 120 spun too fast. The Antec spins slow (therefore quieter) and has a manual switch for speed control, allowing it to spin at the same RPMs as the stock fan. I had to solder the connector from the stock fan to the Antec fan for it to work (just match of the red & black wires).","rating":3},{"comment":"If you think the PSU will provide you with 600W across the board you are wrong. I got it because I needed 12V with at least 380W but upon trying this thing out it would shut off after running my device after 10-30 seconds. Turns out that you are only getting a max of 24 amps at 12V which comes to less than 300W! The used 'creative math' to somehow add up the wattages of 3V 5V and 12V but that is hardly what people consider when buying a PSU. Might be OK for very low power PC's without any kind of discreet graphic card.","rating":2},{"comment":"If I could give it Zero stars I would. This power supply was DOA. DEAD.Not worth the return shipping to send it back.If you want a good power supply go with a name brand and spend a few extra bucks.Lesson learned.","rating":1},{"comment":"Terrific little unit.  I've had it a little over a month at this point and really have no complaints other than some minor quibbles about the DVR interface, which to be sure, is as good as what you'd expect to find on a Dish or DirecTV DVR, but could be improved even more.  The entire system is very solidly built with a robust and well-organized remote control and the DVR unit itself which is in a metal case.  That's more important that you might realize since the primary cause of failures for this type of electronic device is torque on the motherboard due to insufficiently rigid plastic casements.  Mine operates off the WIFI and has an external drive, which I prefer because a failure of one doesn't crash the entire system.  It's a little expensive, but as a cord cutter, I'm saving a hundred bucks a month, so some capital investment up front is still saving a lot of money over time.","rating":4},{"comment":"I live in an area with decent broadcast reception, so a DVR becomes a viable alternative to cable TV.  We've tried cable and satellite TV in the past, but always cancelled it quickly because of the poor video quality, high price and almost endless commercials.  We also found ourselves looking at very few of the channels, so having 100 unwatched channels of garbage didn't seem a good value.With the DVR+, we get excellent reception which looks just as good as the TV's built-in tuner.  The remote could be set to operate our TV too, which simplifies operation.  The system was easy to set up, including the internet adapter.  I purchased one of the recommended hard drives for enhanced operation.  It was also easy to install and format the hard drive.The on-screen TV guide is easy to peruse and makes it easy to select programs to record.  The system has flexible options to record a program as well as playback and MOST IMPORTANT, quickly skipping all those obnoxious pecker pill and telecom ads.My only criticism is the cost, which seems high to me, especially since you have to buy all the accessories separately.  Quality is good though, so remembering not having to pay those high cable fees every month softens the cost impact.  Adding some inexpensive streaming services with a roku box is a great compliment to this DVR for a full video solution that is superior to cable in every way.Because the DVR+ has two tuners, I added a splitter to my antenna line coming in, with one output going to the DVR+ and the other going to the TV tuner.  Because the DVR+ connects to the TV via the HDMI port, I can record two programs at once on the DVR+ (with an optional hard drive added) while I watch a third, and even use the TV's picture in picture feature to watch two programs at once (one on the TV tuner and one on the DVR+ tuner) while recording a third program.","rating":5},{"comment":"I purchased the CM-7500GB16 this week from Channel Master and I am very impressed with this DVR.  I purchased directly from Channel Master since I did not need the WiFi device and HDMI chord that was offered on Amazon....otherwise I love Amazon and would have purchased from their site.  I have the DVR connected via ethernet cable to my Netgear WiFi range extender that is configured as a bridge to my entertainment center.  I purchased a WD My Passport Ultra 1 TB hard drive to store the DVR+ recordings.  I connect the HDMI out from the DVR to my Yamaha AV receiver for surround sound and use a Logitech Harmony 880 remote control for the entire entertainment system (Yamaha AV receiver, Samsung TV, Sony blu ray player and CM DVR).  I used the Harmony software to add a digital set top box and entered CM-7500GB16 for the model and it was recognized and all functions of the DVR are controlled.  I have tested the live TV pause and rewind feature as well as the recording feature and they both work perfectly.  The CM online guide is very useful in changing channels and selecting shows for recording.  I am saving $150 per month by terminating my cable television provider and purchasing the Leaf ultimate antennas for my HDTVs.  I have high speed internet provided by Greenfield Communications via fiber optic to the home and included in my HOA monthly assessment. I am very pleased with the purchase of the CM DRV+ and with not paying cable television bills anymore.","rating":5},{"comment":"We purchased the CM7500 directly from CM because we didn't want the bundle.After three days of using the box we are very happy.  Based on the Dish DVR the user interface works well.***Update:  6\/9\/2014Our previous DVR was a good media player with the OTA DVR function \"bolted on\".  I had\/has some issues and I fried the tuners trying to fix a problem.The CM7500 has a user interface (UI) from our former Dish days.  We like it very much.I'm using a WD 2T \"green\" HDD in a USB 2.0 external enclosure.  Works great with the CM7500.  I don't think the CM7500 is particularly sensitive to which HDD one uses.Measured power consumption:Active 15W (10 7500, 5 HDD), ~$15\/yrStandby 10W (8 7500, 2 HDD). ~$10\/yrI have found CM tech support for the CM7500 to be first rate.  I have asked numerous questions and have received answers the next day.  Here is an example explaining the proper way to remove and attach a USB HDD that users might find useful.\"The proper way to remove a disk drive is to simply remove, but then you must wait to see what comes on the screen. It will ask you to reboot the DVR+ so that it will be ready without the drive. Then once the TV program comes back on you will be able to plug the drive back in and make sure to follow the onscreen instructions again. This is the best way to remove and reconnect the hard drive.\"Channel MasterTechnical Support***Update 6\/15\/14After a weeks worth of using it improvements I would like to see:a) give priority to navigation button response time ( over playback if necessary ).  Presently, too much lag time.b) guide navigation: we have page up\/down, jump 1 day forward\/back, jump 2.5 hrs back\/forward?????  There needs to be a jump 2.5hrs forward button.c) guide option for smaller font with more displayed time slots and\/or full screen guide.d) DLNA compatibility ( server, player)e) All bluray players have Netflix, etc.  No need to duplicate this capability.  Focus on providing the best ota DVR experience.***Update 6\/23Regarding the button response time mentioned above:I have found that if I pause the TV (either live or playing from a recorded program) screen navigation is much, much faster.  On the other hand, recording programs (one or two)seem to have very little effect on the button response time.  This makes sense if one makes the reasonable assumption that very little cpu time is needed to record programs (just MOVING already compressed video from the tuners to the HDD at 2 x 20Mb\/s or 5MB\/s, &lt;1% of cpu capacity) while DECODING the compressed video takes >50% of the cpu capacity.  If the cpu is busy decoding the compressed video it can't response as fast to a pressed button.Is USB 2.0 fast enough?  Does one need USB 3.0?USB 2.0 has a max data rate of 480Mb\/s.  I have measured 200Mb\/s sustained on the USB 2.0 drive I am using.  If one is recording two programs and playing another, the HDD needs to handle 3 x 20Mb\/s = 60Mb\/s (20Mb\/s is the maximum one gets from an OTA ATSC broadcast).  My USB drive can provide 200Mb\/s and I only ne\/2ed 60Mb\/s.  Thus my experience that USB 2.0 works well is consistent with the basic math.Update 7\/2We now have quite a few recorded programs and we wish for a more extensive folder\/file system.  Currently, files of exactly the same name are grouped in folders.  If you modify the name (e.g. to provide additional program descriptions like episode) the file is no longer placed in the folder.  For example, if one changes the name of a file from \"program\" to \"program\"\/\"episode\" the file will no longer be grouped into the \"program\" folder.  I have suggested to CM that the 7500 be modified to ignore \"\/\" and everything after it in the file name.  If this is done, one can rename the files to be \"program\"\/\"episode\" and they will all be placed in the \"program\" folder.  CM tech support agreed to pass on this suggestion to the design team.","rating":5},{"comment":"We purchased this unit and the time function has serious flaws, it missess the start of programs up to 20minutes.  I talked with CM and they are trying to fix it... but until they do I will not purchase another... I sent mine back for a refund after waiting over 6 weeks for the fix and my 90 day tech support warranty was going to be up... (what is this 90 day tech warranty anyway)  The issue is a real problem... I have recorded several programs to find them starting up to 20 minutes late.I also was having real issues with the video locking up after the latest firmware upgrade.Great product, good idea but wait for the bugs to be fixed before buying it.","rating":2},{"comment":"I had been searching for a long time for something like the DVR+. I didn't want to pay monthly fees. Just wanted to record shows like a VCR, but most of the DVD recorders were bulky and glitchy. I got wind of this DVR+ while it was in development, and ordered it when it was first available. I have NO regrets.Very modern small design - about a half inch thick. Got a Seagate 1 terabyte hard drive, and it too is very small. Connected the DVR to an Ethernet cable, and for four months now have been easily recording multiple shows, stopping live TV, backing up and re-watching anything I want. This thing rocks.Set up was simple, maneuvering the menu, channel guide, and recording options is all pretty intuitive. Mine has kept perfect time, it's never missed a recording, and has never had an issue. My whole family loves it.The remote design isn't my favorite, but I can easily let that slide for the capability of this machine. It's just so simple. Not a lot of extras or bells and whistles, but that's not what I care about. This thing just does what I want, without a lot of fanfare. I would SO recommend it!","rating":5},{"comment":"I cut my cable (TV) almost four years ago.  I've been Internet streaming with Netflix, Amazon and others, but occasionally switch a TV over to &#34;Antenna&#34; for the local news, football or PBS.  Initially, when I &#34;cut the cable&#34;, I did look into DVRs for Antenna (OTA) TV.  The uncompressed HD picture and sound from antennas is really great, especially for football games shown on broadcast stations.  Back then, four years ago, the DVR choices were minimal and expensive.Now, I wonder why I waited so long.  This DVR is still expensive, but the functionality and storage capability is far better than I expected.  I bought a two-terabyte WD external USB My Book hard drive (about $100) to connect to the Channel Master, and now it seems like I have unlimited storage space for saved programs.  The DVR does have internal storage for programming, pausing, rewinding, etc., but it is limited.  You won't be able to save much of anything.Well, this thing works just like a &#34;cable box&#34; with two tuners.  What really makes it entirely usable is the two-week program schedule it shows on the TV screen.  Just like a cable box, that's where you scroll through the available channels, see &#34;what's on&#34;, and even schedule shows to record.  You also get the &#34;time shifting&#34; pause, fast forward, and rewind functions of a cable box.  I really missed that functionality of a cable box.Unlike TIVO, there is no monthly subscription fee.  So even though the Channel Master is expensive, it's a one-time cost, and then you're done with it.  You can now time-shift and record your local TV stations.  You can even set the &#34;record&#34; to record shows beyond the two week look-ahead on-screen program guide.When I had mine first go through the channel search during set-up, I found a few channels that I didn't know were out there.  Aside from the ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, & CW networks, there were also a few others that show old TV and Movie content (in SD format).  I really have missed TCM movies since I cut the cable.  I've enjoyed the old movies from that SD movie channel (which I've saved for &#34;rainy&#34; days), and I've been saving a lot of the PBS stuff for similar times.What you get depends on where you live.  If you haven't watched antenna TV for quite a while, you may be surprised at how much is out there &#34;for free&#34;.You do need an Internet connection to get the channel\/program schedule.  I have my DVR plugged in directly with an Ethernet cable, so I haven't tried the the wireless dongle that was included.  The Ethernet is only needed for software updates and the program schedule, so it doesn't need to be &#34;streaming&#34; fast.  I'd guess it will work fine if you have a decent wireless signal at the DVR.  I'll probably use the included USB wireless dongle with something else, perhaps one of my older computers.The included 12-foot HDMI cable should be long enough for almost any application.  I used a much shorter one, and saved the 12-footer for a future application.The DVR does have an optical port for compressed digital surround sound (Dolby Digital, DTS, etc.), but the port is a new style recently developed for today's very thin components.  I had never seen a TOSLINK (optical) port like that before.  I ended up buying a TOSLINK to Mini-TOSLINK adapter to use one of my old, spare TOSLINK cables.  I have the DVR connected directly to the TV with an HDMI cable, but connected the TOSLINK cable to my Home Theater receiver, for when I want the surround sound audio coming from the BIG room-shaking speakers.I only gave this device four stars because it is still expensive, and the program schedule from the Ethernet is a bit basic.  As for the schedule, there isn't much that Channel Master can do about that.  It depends on what the various stations provide to ROVI and the cable\/satellite companies.Eventually, as more and more people 'cut the cable', Channel Master will get some competition in the OTA DVR market.  The DVRs will get better, the prices will come down, and even the on-screen program schedule may improve.  I waited four years for this to happen, but finally gave in.  If I was still married, I might of had to wait another four years.  Here's a hint for the married guys.  Your spouse can save all of those pathetic network day-time gossip shows, two channels at a time.  Just make sure it's set up on another TV in another room.  You may need to buy two of these things!","rating":4},{"comment":"------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATED (7\/12\/2014) REVIEW: CHANNEL MASTER DVR+ (CM7500 GB16 BDL2)My two DVR+ devices PLUS both WD hard drives and a $40 CM Wifi adapter have all just paid for themselves (and then some)!I have had two of these DVR+ devices close to 6 months now. I was paying $130 a month for TW cable (including the TW dvr rentals). I cut the cord when these Channel Master dvrs came along and have saved $780 so far! This means that the 2 DVRs, 2 external hard drives necessary (I have 2 WD 1TB Passport drives, $68 each), and one $40 CM Wifi adapter (my other DVR+ is hard wire Ethernet connected) are paid for! Plus, I've added $104 to my savings account rather than paying TWC for programming that I'm now getting for free!  Plus, all the conveniences of dvrs !This is an excellent over the air DVR in general. Free continually updating 14 day local channel listings (when connected to Internet - 2 day listings even without the Internet connection) for watching and recording. Very quiet operation, no internal fans and doesn't get hot. It has total max up to 1080i HD from local channels (depends on local channel quality) and 1080p HD from streaming Internet channels... and with no buffering or any other issues.UPDATE 7\/10\/2014: According to CM Tech Support (7\/10\/14), the following issues are being addressed and possibly fixed in near future with software updates:1. The DVR+ \/ Rovi Guide does not allow you to skip over reruns when recording. All programs with the same name are recorded, even all reruns. Tech Support: \"We are working on a fix for this, our most common complaint.\"2. The option of deleting a program after watching with just a simplea pop up, \"Do you wish to delete this selection?\" software is also in the works. Tech Support: \"...another issue that's being seriously looked at.\"UPDATE 6\/7\/2014: SOFTWARE UPDATE 108R HAS BEEN ISSUED. There was a problem with the commands from the remote hanging up after the 106R software update (see FAQ #20 below) that caused delays in changing channels and temporary lock ups in some other commands. I have briefly tested the latest software version, all the issues that I experienced seemed to have been cured.FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHANNEL MASTER DVR+:1. The instruction manual with the DVR+ seems incomplete. Is any other manual available?Yes. An extensive manual is available as a download for free from the Channel Master web site.2. Is it possible to watch a \"live\" TV show and also record 2 other programs at the same time?Yes (in most cases). The DVR+ is a dual tuner DVR. Unlike cable or satellite, though, it is an \"over the air\" device. You can attach the input of a two way splitter to your antenna; connect one output from the splitter to the DVR+, the other output to your TV antenna input.It's possible, then, to watch from your TV tuner (by changing the HDMI input on your TV to the \"TV input\") and still record two programs on the DVR+ (it remains connected to the antenna). Splitters do reduce signal strength somewhat, so if you have marginal signal an amplifier may be necessary.3. Is the picture I receive from the DVR+ as good as cable or satellite?Yes, much better in fact! Over the air HD transmissions are in a non-compressed type of signal. Cable transmits hundreds of channels, Internet, and phone connections over one wire. The only way they can do that is to compress the signals (take out portions of the various signals) to fit everything in.However, you must have an adequate antenna and are able to receive OTA transmissions. If you live in an area, remote locations, etc., that have weak signals, it may be better to stick with cable or a satellite provider. Before you buy any OTA equipment, check your signal by attaching your antenna to your TV. If you get good picture without much problem, you should be good to go.4. How do I create a \"manual\" recording on the DVR+?Go to the channel listing guide, pick any program (doesn't matter), then go to the \"manual\" recording option. This allows you to input the channel selection, date, recording start and finish times, and several time slot repeat options are also available. You should also input a title for your manual recording.5. Is Vudu the only option for Internet apps available for DVR+? How do I access that service?Yes. The Internet streaming channel \"Vudu\" is the only one available now (6\/7\/2014), selected as you would any other OTA channel through the channel guide. Two \"major\" services are to be added by mid-December of this year (2014) and two more early 2015.6. The cost of the DVR+ bundle on Amazon seems high in comparison to Channel Master. Why is that?This bundle (BDL2) price includes the DVR+ ($250), the CM USB Internet connection device ($40), necessary to receive channel listing updates as well as software updates and provide the streaming channels (Vudu & more later), and an HDMI cable ($20) necessary to connect to your tv. The Amazon BDL3 includes all of that plus free shipping and an IR extender for the remote. The accessories are offered separately at CM.7. A headphone jack is not included with the DVR+. Is it possible to use a headphone with the DVR+ for the bedroom?The DVR+ has only an optic output for sound, no headphone jack. One possible solution, use these devices: \"Digital Optical Coax to Analog Stereo Audio Converter - USB DAC Headphone Amplifier\" (available on Amazon); and this: \"9to5Cables Ultra Gold Plated Toslink to Mini Plug Digital Optical Audio Cable\" (various lengths). You must select \"stereo sound\" in the audio preferences in the DVR+ if you use these items, they do not support Dolby surround.8. What quality of picture should I expect from the DVR+?This varies: Standard definition up to full 1080i HD on OTA channels (depends on the local transmission quality), and up to full 1080P on Internet streaming channels.9. Is a channel guide included with the DVR+ purchase and is there an annual fee?A channel guide powered by Rovi is included with the purchase (no subscription fees). It is an excellent continually updating guide (14 days with internet connection - 2 days without the connection) for watching live TV and to select programs to record, much like the cable \/ satellite guides you are familiar with. Upon initial setup, the DVR+ scans your area for local channels from your antenna. After the scan, all the channels found appear in your Guide.You can delete any unwanted channels from the DVR+ and the great part is, these channels are also deleted from the channel guide! No more wading through channel listings that you don't want to watch!10. I didn't see anything at Channel Master's site concerning whether the USB is 2 or 3.0. Do you know? I'm looking at external HDs. Also, we'll be hooking this up via hard line to Internet. That's possible, yes?USB 3.0 is recommended. I'm currently using Western Digital's Passport 1TB USB 3.0 drives on my 2 DVR+ devices. I have had no problems so far. The DVR+ does include an Ethernet connection.11. Have the timing issues that were reported, \"Wrong program recorded, recording ends too early or too late, doesn't record from the start, system clock inaccurate\", been solved by the latest software update (106R (5-1-14))?Yes. I have been assured by Channel Master Support (5\/21\/2014) that these issues have been eliminated from the DVR+ with the new 106R update. I have also personally observed a marked improvement.12. There have been complaints of picture \"lock ups\", black bands in the picture, screen black outs, and picture fragmentation... resulting in a totally unwatchable picture. What's that all about?Those descriptions are classic of bad signals from the antenna. Digital HD signals can be fickle. You either get all or nothing, the nature of digital transmissions. When the signal is poor, the picture fragments, blacks out, locks up, etc. But when the signal is good, nothing compares to the quality of picture.13. Is the Channel Master DVR+ capable of providing Dolby Surround sound?Yes, the DVR+ has a \"mini\" optical connection on the back panel. Most component receivers have standard Toslink connection. You can use a Toslink to Mini Plug Digital Optical audio cable to connect to amplifiers\/receivers. There is an option in the audio preferences of the DVR+ for Dolby Surround.14. What is the best antenna to use with the DVR+?The AntennaPoint website can (by supplying your zip code) tell you where your local digital tv transmitters are in relation to you and the approximate distance to the transmitters. Obtain an HDTV antenna that will receive signals at least from the most distant one (I like to add 10 miles to that figure).15. What is the best way to configure my antenna for the DVR+ to get the best reception possible?After everything is installed and you are ready to adjust your antenna, Press \"Menu\" on the remote, go to \"Settings\", then select \"Technical Info\", and then select \"Signals and Network\". There are two bar graph meters at the top right of the screen. One is for \"signal strength\" the other is \"signal quality\". Get as much signal strength as possible for every channel.16. What is CEC and does CEC work with the DVR+?Consumer Electronics Control or CEC is a function that allows you to control multiple devices over HDMI using one remote control by having a secondary device receive commands from a primary device.The DVR+ was not designed to work with CEC. There was a problem with the initial launch (103R software version) that the DVR+ would interfere with other components using CEC. I have been assured by Tech support that those issues were cured with the 106R software version.17. Do lightning suppressors work?Lightning suppressors work in most cases except a direct strike or very close strike to your antenna. You should use an antenna cable line suppressor (make sure it is grounded) in the antenna line.Also use AC line suppressors to prevent spikes from either lightning strikes or shifts in voltage from power companies. These suppressors are rated in Joules. If the surge of electricity surpasses that rating the spike can get into your sensitive electronics and do damage. Get the highest rated (in Joules) you can.As an extra measure, I use push on cable adapters (F Type Jack to F Type Push-On Plug, available from Amazon) for connections from my electronics to my antenna. That makes it simple to pull the connector and also the ac power strip during severe lightning storms.18. Can devices that do not have an HDMI input, such as older TVs and DVD recorders be used with the DVR+, since it only has an HDMI output connection and is high definition in nature?Yes, by using an HDMI to RCA plugs adapter. Do not expect the Hi Definition picture that comes from the DVR+ through the HDMI. You'll only get standard definition. I used this device, \"Mini White HDMI to 3 RCA Composite AV Converter For TV\/PC\/PS3\/Blue-ray DVD \" [available on Amazon). This particular adapter does need USB power. Connect the HDMI from the DVR+ to the HDMI to RCA jacks converter box, then the 3 RCA jacks to your older TV composite video\/ sound input jacks or the DVD recorder composite video\/ sound input jacks. Then connect a USB power source.19. Do the Seagate hard drives (1TB and 3TB) run constantly when connected to the DVR+?Yes, as long as power is supplied to the DVR+. The reason for this, there is a \"spin up time\" for the drive of 2 - 4 seconds. So, if the drive were to shut off, the recording (because of spin up time) would start a little late.I chose the Western Digital Passport drives because they shut off after 30 minutes of inactivity and work well with the DVR+. They are physically smaller drives and spin up time is reduced (approx 1-2 seconds}.20. Since the 106R update, I have noticed one negative effect. The response in the remote control seems more sluggish, especially when changing channels. Is this something I have to live with?The 108R update released on 6\/7\/2014 seems to have solved these problems that were connected to the 106R software. Update your software to this newer version.21. How long is the support for the free program guide?There are definite plans (according to CM Tech Support) to expand the device's streaming capability towards the end of 2014 and into 2015. I don't see support for the DVR+ going away anytime soon.22. What is the warranty and\/or satisfaction guarantee?The satisfaction guarantee is 30 days (from Channel Master and\/or Amazon - full refund). The standard warranty period is 1 year parts and labor and includes 90 days free tech support. An additional 1 year warranty period (total 2 years) is available for $39.99, from Channel Master.23. Can you stream Netflix?No, not currently (6\/7\/14). CM tech support says that 2 \"major\" services will be added by 12\/15\/2014 and 2 more early 2015. No specific streaming channel names were given.24. Is the included internet adapter any different than cheaper ones offered by Amazon, and will the cheaper ones work with the DVR+?According to Channel Master it is different and the DVR+ will only work with the Channel Master Wi-Fi adapter (because of this adapter's controller software). I have tried two different cheaper ones myself, neither one would work (the CM one works with no issues).25. Can the recorded shows (recorded on hard drive and internal memory) be accessed without an Internet connection?Yes. An Internet connection is not necessary to play back any recorded material.26. Is the remote RF (radio frequency) or IR (infrared)?The remote is IR and does need line of sight to operate. An IR extender so the device can be used in cabinets, etc. is available in the BDL3 package on Amazon or separately at Channel Master.27. Is this DVR+ usable with cable tv?No. The DVR+ has dual HD ATSC digital tuners and is only for OTA (over the air) channels with an antenna.28. Are subtitles available when recorded shows are played back?Yes. There is a dedicated button on the remote control marked \"CC\" for subtitles, this works on the recorded programs as well as \"live\" tv (provided the original program had that feature).29. How many hours of HD programming will the external USB hard drive record?A 500 GB drive yields approx. 80hrs of HD recording, 1 TB approx.160hrs, a 2 TB drive approx. 320hrs, and a 3tb drive will give you approx. 480 hours of hi definition recordings.30. Can the DVR+ pause \"live\" tv?Yes. The DVR+ (CM-7500 16GB) has 16 GB of internal SS memory which allows a two hour buffer in live programming (if an external hard drive is connected, 15 minutes if not). You can pause, go back, fast forward, slow back, slow forward.... Pretty much everything you expect in a DVR31. Does it receive clear QAM (cable) signals?No. Only dual ATSC (over the air) digital HD tuners are included in the DVR+. A clear QAM tuner was not provided because of the recent FCC ruling (2013) that will soon eliminate clear QAM.32. What are the actual measurements of the DVR+?10 5\/8\" wide, 8\" deep (front to back), 1\/2\" (5\/8\" with the feet) thick. Weight, about a pound and a half, maybe a little less. This is actual DVR+ dimensions, however, allow at least a couple of inches in the back for the connecting cords.33. The remote control uses 2 CR2032 batteries.  How long do they last and are they difficult to obtain?They last about as long as traditional AAA's or AA's in a remote. It would, however, be a good idea to have some in your battery drawer, just as you would other batteries. I bought the \"Energizer CR2032  Battery 10 Pack (2 packs of 5)\" (sold on Amazon for $7.99)34.  Does this device have \"skip\" buttons on the remote?The DVR+ remote has dedicated programmable (30 seconds forward, 10 seconds back; default) skip buttons (for \"live\" tv and recordings).  Additionally, you can skip forward or backward a full minute using the left and right arrows on either side of the \"OK\" button while watching a recording.","rating":5},{"comment":"--- Updated ---The Channel Master DVR+ is one of a few HD DVRs offered without a subscription.  On paper, the device seems to check enough the right boxes with me so I ordered thru Amazon.My assessment:Pros:- Small, neat form factor.- Easy to use.- When it works, it's a pleasant experienceCons- Tuner seems to have problems pulling in stations that other hardware can aquire off the same antenna.- Caused hand shaking problems issues with HDMI CEC enabled devices. ---addressed with a CEC less cable- Occasionally hangs during channel changes (signal reception related?)- Gets confused with Station IDs in guide. --- Possibly fixed in firmware- Recorded the wrong program with the right name.  Recorded program was on different channel than specified. ---Possibly fixed in firmware- Had difficulties with updating the firmware over USB.- No antenna pass thru.General Interface And Use:Outside of all the problems, it's actually a great device.  I like the simplicity of the guide.  I like the ability to record all programs of the same name.  When the device works or is not keeping other devices from working, it's a good unit.Reception Issues:This unit was purchased to replace a SD DVR (Magnavox MDR533H).  The DVR+, like the unit before it had its own Mohu amplified indoor antenna facing the same direction and on the same wall as a identical Mohu unit attach to my TV (Samsung F8000).  The DVR+ failed to pull in 9 channels during an auto scan that both the F8000 and MDR533H picked up.  I had a Samsung ES7100 where the F8000 now sits and it had no difficulties pulling in all of same channels.  Swapping the antennas between the TV and DVR+ indicates the antennas are not the problem.  The F8000 still had 9 more channels than the DVR+ could detect.  I even removed power from antenna to see if the signal was too strong.  Nope. The tuners inside the DVR+ just aren't as good.  A manual scan only brought in 2 of the 9 missing channels.HDMI CEC:The DVR+ does not have HDMI CEC and caused problems with devices when HDMI CEC was enabled on them.  The DVR+ was first installed in the DVR port of my Pioneer VSX-822-K AVR.  I experienced issues with the HDMI standby and pass thru features not working and general switching problems.  Therefore, I installed the unit directly into the TV after reseting the units and the problems remained.  I upgraded to a new AVR (Sony STR-DN1050) and repeated the trials with the receiver and TV connections yet the handshaking, standby, and pass thru issues remained.  Only when I removed the DVR+ completely and reset all the HDMI devices did things return to normal.  I shouldn't have to choose between HDMI CEC being enabled and using the DVR+.  --- Made CEC less cable to address.  User states problem was fix in firmware update but Channel Master has neglected to answer my email regarding the issue so I can't confirm.Guide And Program Recording Issues:After adding a channel manually, it seems as if the DVR+ became confused about what stations were what.  In the program guide, Vudu moved from being on channel 200 to 65 (which is really Ion).  When tuning channels 200 and 65 were as they are supposed to be;  they were wrongly designated only in the guide.  This error I believe lead to the wrong program being recorded once.  The program to be recorded was set using the guide.  What was actually recorded was a program in the adjacent channel but it was named as if it was the one I selected.  ---- Firmware seems to have addressed.The DVR+ in my possession seems to be underachieving in its performance.  Watch this space for updates.  we'll see how Channel Master responds to these issues.  --- I received an automated message that my support request would be addressed in 24 hours but it has been 96+ hours.  Maybe people who don't give them good reviews don't get support?  The review is changeable based upon their response or lack there of.  So far only other users have tried to assist.  More importantly, I have helped myself.  Not a good sign of things to come.","rating":2},{"comment":"This DVR+ is exactly what I'd been looking for, for a while now. We didn't cancel Comcast because we couldn't figure out what to use in its place. Now we have the perfect setup.We decided that we didn't want Comcast cable anymore and after researching decided not to stream TV because of the tier setup Comcast has started. Why quit cable just to pay more with streaming? We know it's just going to get worse and all the setups I found were difficult to set up. I wanted something extremely easy. We also tried the Roku and found that not only did it act like a virus, taking over all the settings on our equipment, after checking further we would pay not only a monthly fee to the sites they contract with, but also $1.99 per episode for the shows we watch. No thanks. Back it went to Best Buy.We eventually purchased a Clearstream 2V long range HDTV from Best Buy and hooked it up. This has given us the clearest signal I've ever seen on our Elite TV. It really blew Comcast signal away. It's like looking through a window into the scene on the TV. Beautiful.So then we needed something to record with.Enter Channel Master. I found this unit through an AVS forum and checked it out both at the C M site and at Amazon, and decided to purchase it. It's WONDERFUL!1. We can record 2 programs at once. We haven't tried watching a 3rd program while doing this, but that's probably because we couldn't do that with our Comcast DVR so we don't care. So far the programming has been right on. It starts about 1-2 min before and goes 1-2 min after, we noted.2. This was a 5 min breeze to set up. I don't think we've set anything this easy up around our TV since we purchased the TV.3. Rather than using wireless, we connected a hardline to the DVR for internet connectivity which is needed for the Rovi channel guide, I believe.4. All remotes should be the size of the CM remote. It's SMALL and thin. While some reviewers haven't liked this, we love it. We have no problem knowing which end to face toward the TV, the buttons are easy to find, and it's great. Also, ALL DVRs should be the size of this DVR. It's so small it fits about anywhere. The remote is easy to use and understand. KISS is a good word for this: Keep it Simple Stupid. If they were to make the remote even better, it would light up when you move it like our Logitech universal remote. Oh well, no big deal.5. The channel guide is great, similar to Comcast's. Very good enough.6. It's very easy to work with the remote, to find the guide, how to set your recordings, etc. However, online at CM is a much more detailed user guide, which I downloaded.7. The automatic updates are not a breeze to work with, but after mentioning it to commenter \"JJ\"--who is absolutely wonderful with his very knowledgeable and helpful posts--we tried it again and just let it sit there. After awhile it just started downloading. We had received an error message saying that the download was being aborted (something other users have had occur, as well). The first time we closed out and tried it again, to no avail. I was going to download the update and use the USB slot to install it but decided the next day to try the CM updater instead. After waiting patiently, as JJ did, it worked. So if that's the only glitch, I'm fine with that.8. Deleting the recorded programs has been easy to do. Finding them to watch has been equally as easy.9. Recording quality is great. Comcast is horrible in comparison. Our recorded programs through the Comcast DVR always seemed like standard definition. The programs recorded through this are crystal clear. Now, in one of the first recordings we did have some sort of pause, it seemed, in the scenes. We haven't seen that since, but that doesn't mean it won't happen again sometime. I don't know whether or not it's the DVR or reception.10. This DVR does not have internal storage. It's not meant to have that, so you need to purchase an external drive to record. Since I'd rather add my own and have virtually unlimited storage, I'm fine with this. We purchased a 1TB WD external harddrive and plugged it into the USB port. So, if we fill this up we don't have to start deleting unless we want to. If we'd like to keep the programs we've put on there (say our TV series for future possible viewing) we can do that and just put another HD on there later. Easy.11. DVR time is perfect, exactly the same as my computer time.12. One thing about this DVR--we haven't picked times to record; rather, we've set recordings by a show title. There is, however, a plus or minus time for the recording. We haven't used that. Also, we can record the series. That said, I believe JJ noted the challenge that might arise if some pre-emptive live broadcast comes on in your scheduled show. You'll lose your show recording. Well, for those instances internet viewing works, and we've had to do that with Comcast when it, for no reason at all, cut our program off and we only got 20 min, or it never recorded it in the first place. So at those times we've gone to the network site and watched our show there.13. The DVR+ has Vudu, and that's it. We don't care, we don't use it anyway. For our needs, our Blu-ray player has about all the streaming sites anyway.14. On set up, the CM scanned our TV for channels and picked up more than we were able to get with just the antenna. Also, on some channels the antenna wasn't strong enough to bring in voice. Not a problem with the CM.For our viewing, this is perfect. We don't watch much TV and didn't want to pay the huge price for Comcast anymore. They had just raised our rates $60 for premium channels that we never watched. So with this setup we were able to cancel. Now they won't stop calling to see if they can get us back.We now use the CM and antenna for our network shows. We rent new movies from RedBox, watch cable shows on DVD from Netflix and occasionally stream movies with Amz Prime. Most internet apps are provided by our Panasonic Blu-Ray but since we don't want to pay a monthly fee, then a per-episode fee, we don't use these apps. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we also don't want to stream very much--Comcast is starting to charge more for data and Dish had data packages that we would have paid a lot for to stream many programs. Not an option.","rating":5},{"comment":"I bought this product from channel master.  A great addition to not having cable or satellite and still having a DVR.  My wife want a second one for the tv upstairs.  They are constantly doing upgrades on the software.  Very happy with this purchase.","rating":5},{"comment":"I see no point in rehashing the pros and cons that others have written so I'll just add some of my own.  Had it not been for the poor customer service of the satellite and cable companies, I would not have cut the cord.  Yes, it's good not to have those monthly charges, but there were some cable channels that we watched a lot that we no longer have.  Overall we are better off from a financial and reliability standpoint.  We live in a fringe area and do not get the numerous channels that some other locations do.  Our channel list says 27 channels, but some are duplicates and a few are of no use to us at all.  We do get all of the major network stations and that's what we want.  Some of the cable channels we watched, such as the History Channel, changed their type of programming so we don't need those anymore.I did pay to have a tech come out and install and sight our antenna.  I may or may not have been able to struggle  through that process, but it's tricky to get the sighting just right since there are at least 3 major transmitter directions.  We do need an outdoor antenna mounted on a pole on the roof.  There are no line-of-sight transmitters visible from our house.The only negatives for the DVR+ are that Rovi does not have data for all the channels, even some that are duplicates of the major networks.  I had a hard time getting the wifi dongle into the usb port on the dvr.  The usb from the ext. HD fit just fine.  It's really not a good idea to force the fit too much either.  Yes, I had it oriented correctly.  The first time I scanned in the channels, the weaker channel did not show up.  I downloaded and installed the most current firmware and re-scanned, getting the weak channel added.  It is still a little flaky though so we'll have to fine tune the antenna direction some more.  I see the newest version now has a built in 1tb hd and is $100 more.  I got a western digital 1tb hd from Amazon for $69.  If it crashes, it will be easy to replace.  Just sayin...","rating":4},{"comment":"I cut the cable cord about a year ago... Since then I got Netflix for movies ($8) and hulu plus for shows I missed when they came on for lack of a DVR ($8). The last thing I wanted was to add another $15 for Tivo or $5 for simple.tv or tablo. I mean what is the point of getting rid of cable if you have to keep adding 5 or 10 dollars a month from 3 or 4 different services? My end goal is to eliminate hulu and just keep netflix using the Channelmaster to record shows as they happen. So far it is working great... Here are my pro's and con'sPros1. No monthly fee WOOHOO2. I can add whatever size storage I want to it or even TWO drives if I want.3. Works great with my Harmony remote4. Very slim design takes up very little space.5. Can record two shows at once.6. Connects straight to TV unlike Simple.TV and Tablo which need a Roku and an app to watch shows on TV.7. Can I mention again NO FEES? =)Cons.1. No wifi built in. At the price if you do not have a HD ( I already had one) and ability to hard wire to internet the price can easily go up $100 to outfit yours. Still there is no fee which you still come out ahead after a year.2. Program guide. Not as detailed as Tivo or others. I found some of the extreme FRINGE UNKNOWN stations in my area the guide is never right.. But for any channel I would actually watch they are accurate.3. No remote viewing via IOS or ANDROID or LAPTOP. Though I found this is not a gamechanger for myself it might be for some as all the other major players in the DVR game do have remote viewing.4. No ability to just record FIRST showings of a series so you have to go back and delete reruns.5. Overall the system is very simplistic. Lacks a lot of bells and whistles. More of a digital VCR with a limited guide built in.6. OEM remote had issues penetrating glass on my entertainment center. I use a harmony which worked great but I felt this might be an issue if I had to use OEM remote.7. TUNER. I have read reviews that the Tuner does not pick up some channels well. Though My DVR found 77 Channels which is 30+ more than my Panasonic Plasma TV was able to pick up with it's tuner.Overall I find this is a great option for people that want to DVR shows but do not want to get stuck paying a subscription service to do so. I REALLY missed being able to pause live TV and rewind to see things again.. This DVR makes me happy =)","rating":4},{"comment":"Very pleased with this product. Have been using it for a while now.

This works so very well for the purpose.  LED is a big plus, because sometimes the port you are using is somewhere that the lighting is dim, so it shines nice and bright and is easily readable from some distance away.I don't have sophisticated equipment to measure how accurate the numbers are, but based on charging rates of various devices I have, it seems to be right on.Durability?  Well, it seems adequately made for homeowner use.  If you were plugging this in multiple times a day to various sources (working in IT or something), I wonder if this would hold up to heavy use.  But, be honest:  You'll use something like this a lot for the first few days or weeks you have it, then maybe once or twice a month if you want to check out an adaptor or cable.  Using it like that, I expect it to last me for years.  If that's not the case, I'll re-post if it breaks.","rating":5},{"comment":"I love this product. When I first started seeing flaky behavior from my external battery charging setup, I needed a tool to figure out where the problem resided. But when I read the Android user forums on this topic, I found out that USB charge modes further complicated things, especially since Apple-compatible chargers tend to not follow the USB standards.What to TestMy external battery has 2 ports, one for 1 amp output, and another for 2 amp output. I have 2 devices to charge, each following a different USB protocol. I also needed to compare several USB cables to see if any of them had significant issues. More importantly, I needed to find out whether the data-shorted charging mode would work better for some of these devices. Finally, I needed to compare several chargers to see which ones worked best. That's a lot of testing. And to top it all off, I needed to test a bunch of new products I ordered on Amazon intended to fix the problems this little metering device revealed.Results of TestingThanks to this product, I was able to rank my USB cables in order of best to worse, and eliminate the ones that I now know were responsible for the slow charging of my iPad. In addition, I was able to confirm that shorting the data wires allowed significantly higher amperage to be used in charging my iPad, whereas my Android phone seemed to do fine using normal USB mode. This is specific to the behavior of the Satechi external battery I use. But since I use it often, I went ahead and ordered two data-shorting adapters to allow me to charge my devices quicker. But upon arrival, I used this meter to test them and found them both to be defective. Again, after ordering another manufacturer's product, I tested it and found it to work correctly.I can't say enough for the nice design of this product. The bright blue and red LED display is very easy to read, and the 2 ports--one normal, one with data wires shorted--allowed me to quickly determine which devices faired better and which made no difference using a charge-only setup.During all of this testing, I found the meter's readings to be fairly consistent. I read some reviews where people complained about accuracy, but the only time I thought the readings were flaky, it turned out to be my weak battery, in combination with an almost fully charged iPad, ramping down the output. Once I drained my iPad to 30% and topped-off the external battery, I was able to get very consistent readings that never deviated by more than 2%.Buy ThisI highly recommend this product. It was essential in helping me to correct my slow charging issue and to verify that other USB charging products work.","rating":5},{"comment":"Works great with the advantage of showing voltage and current draw at the same time.

My unit also seemed to have been connected opposite of what it should have been because output 2 could only pass .5 amps of current while output 1 easily handled the 1.8 amps needed to charge a Windows tablet computer. -- On to the review ---This power meter turned in very accurate measurements for a low cost piece of test equipment so there is no question that it can get that job done.  The LED display is the best feature of this tool.  It's easy to read without being surface-of-the-sun bright and having two colors makes for easy at-a-glance readings.  Fantastic!Sadly, as a package, there are some glaring faults.First, it should have come with at least a single piece of paper that tells you what it is and what it is supposed to do so you can adjust your expectations accordingly but there was nothing but the unit in a plastic zip-lock bag.  Providing that information only on the Amazon page (which could disappear any time) is not a good substitute.  I did not remove any stars for this.Second, the (male) USB plug on the unit is the same that you would find on a USB-to-Ethernet adapter and will clearly not survive a lot of plug-unplug cycles.  For a piece of test equipment that will see a lot of handling, this is a problem.  Although a good technician or even a so-so one like myself could easily replace or repair it when it breaks, an average person could not so I deducted a star because of this.Third, the first two five star reviews were done by &#34;top reviewers&#34; who received units for test\/evaluation.  It's just my opinion, but I think objectivity takes on a different hue when the reviewer has no skin in the game so I deducted a star.  My review would have been four star otherwise.Despite having to send back my unit because it was defective, I still think this is conceptually a very good tool.  For very light use, this tool deserves a look.","rating":3},{"comment":"This handy little USB output detector is quite useful. Basically you can plug it into any device that that is charging via a USB cable and it will tell you how many volts and amps it's charging at. One end of it will get plugged into your power source whether it's a USB wall charger, computer USB port or even a portable battery pack. Then you plug the device that you want to test into one of the ports on the USB detector. One side is for measuring Amps and the other side it for measuring Volts. The USB detector is solid and durable in a hard plastic shell. It's very small and easy to take with you anywhere.There are many uses for a device like this. The other day one of my portable battery packs wasn't working properly. I was trying to charge it and both the battery back and wall charger got really hot and the battery pack was dead after hours or charging. I needed to know if the wall charger or the battery pack was the problem so I put this little device to work. I connected this USB detector to the wall charger and plugged in another battery pack. It was charging at about 1.5 Amps. Then I proceeded to remove the battery pack and connect the battery pack that had stopped working and the LCD screen said 0.00 Amps. That told me that the wall charger was functional and the battery pack was toast and something had got fried in it.I had another battery pack that had a short and started smoking when I tried to charge it. I was able to use it the same way to determine that the battery pack was just fine and that it was the little USB charging cable that was the problem. I connected the USB connector and battery pack and it said 0.00 Amps. I replaced the problem cable with a different cable and the LCD screen started reading at just under 2.0 Amps.If you have ever had a USB port stop working then this little device will tell you for sure as well. We have an older laptop that has a short in it or something. One of the USB ports doesn't work at all. This detector gave me a 0.00 Amps reading as well so it confirmed that for me.Overall I like this little USB detector a lot. I think it's accurate and it's built well. I test and review a lot of electronic devices so it has come in especially handy to me but just about anyone could use this USB detector. I would highly recommend it.Sample provided for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"I&#8217;ve bought several USB power meters because of my work, and I like this one the best, for these reasons:1. It displays both voltage and current at the same time, instead of cycling between the two (or using a switch or button to select between the two).2. Other USB power meters that use an LCD display can be hard to read in dim lighting.3. Some other USB power meters that use an LED display are too dim to read in bright light. With this USB power meter the digits are large and bright.The dual outputs are interesting:Output I connects all the pins, allowing the device to communicate with the power source. When an Apple iPad is connected to an Apple iPad power adapter through Output I, it draws 2A. But when a Google Nexus 5 is connected, it doesn&#8217;t recognize the Apple iPad power adapter&#8217;s signal, and limits itself to 0.5A.Output II has the data pins shorted together. When a Google Nexus 5 is connected to Output II (using the same Apple iPad power adapter as the source) it detects the shorted data pins and charges at 1A. But an Apple iPad doesn&#8217;t recognize that signal, and limits itself to 0.5A.To complicate things further, many cheap USB cables have wires that are simply too thin to carry 2A at 5V.This is, sadly, the current messed-up state of the USB charging world, which is why you need a USB power meter like this one to work out what is going on.","rating":5},{"comment":"I often need to test battery chargers for mobile devices like tablets and cellphones. Even without doing any quantitative measurements, it's apparent that some of them don't recharge as fast as others, even when they claim to have the same output voltage and amperage. And I've had at least one case where the problem was the charging cable, not the charger itself. I have a couple of USB power meters, but neither of them has all the features of the AboveTEK meter, so I was happy to give it a try. After using the meter a few times, I love it. It has four features that make it stand out above any other meter that I've used:1. The LED display shows both voltage and amperage simultaneously. Other meters that I've used either had a button or switch that you used to toggle between the two readings, or the meter toggled automatically every few seconds. Seeing both readings at once is a big plus.2. The AboveTEK meter has a short length of cable that connects the meter to the power source. This lets you rotate the meter to view the display. If you've ever used a meter that plugs directly into a power source, you'll appreciate this.3. The LED display is very bright and easy to read. Some meters have an LCD display with no backlighting, and these can be almost impossible to read in dim lighting.4. The AboveTEK meter has two USB-out ports. In testing the meter for recharging, I used the port labeled &#34;Output I.&#34; I haven't tried &#34;Output II&#34; yet, but the product description indicates that it has a built-in circuit for &#34;Accelerated Large Current Fast Charging.&#34;I checked the accuracy of the AboveTEK meter with another USB meter that I trust, and the readings were within about 5% of each other, which is close enough for an inexpensive meter of this type.I really like the AboveTEK meter, enough so that my other meters are going into retirement now.A product sample was provided for review purposes.","rating":5},{"comment":"This little meter is simple and very easy to read.red volts\/blue amps show at the same time.works as a usb 2.0 hub also.shipped quick.item was as stated and more.A+++.","rating":5},{"comment":"The \"AboveTEK USB Power Meter USB Current Meter\" is a small gadget for reading Volts and Amps when charging an e-device.This device is available on Amazon.com and retails for $17.95 at the time of writing this review.Please Note: I was provided with a free device for the purpose of writing an honest review.The technical: (copied from the product page)Dual Color Current and Voltage Meter for USB interfaceSimultaneously displaying of Amp and Volt in real-timeMeasuring Range: Voltage 3.0 ~ 10V Current 0 ~ 3A Accuracy: +\/- 1%USB Output Port 1 is dedicated for both Data Sync and Battery ChargingUSB Output Port 2 has built-in circuit for Accelerated Large Current Fast ChargingSome thoughts on \"AboveTEK USB Power USB current Meter\"...1.) this unit is placed between the source of your charge (USB wall charger, USB car charger or ext. battery) and the device being recharged. Once the connection is made this unit reads out the volts and amps.2.a) it has two USB ports for simultaneous charging, but the 'output II' port will usually charge your device quicker.2.b) when two devices are charged at the same time the amp reading will reflect the combined total of both ports3.) works with both Apple and Android devices.Impressions:With this USB meter you can determine which of your USB chargers are better (faster) and which of your cords (lightning\/USB, micro\/USB etc.) are more efficient, because the higher amp flow the faster the device charges.Previously I just assumed that all USB wall chargers, USB car chargers and all USB connector cords had the same charging quality... they do not.  i.e. some do not charge as fast as others. I was surprised at some of the differences in amp flow when I played around testing the different hook-ups.A small but very useful unit for getting the best recharging performance for your e-devices.As it is... 5 Stars.Ray @ralannicholson","rating":5},{"comment":"I received this item free in exchange for a review but despite that I'll be honest about it. Also know that I'm not an electrical engineer so my viewpoint is that of an average Joe trying to use the product.When I got the offer to review this thing I was pretty excited because I've got all manner of chargers that want reviews and it'd be nice to have a device to test their output. Unfortunately, things didn't quite work out as simply as I'd hoped.For one thing, I thought (rather stupidly in retrospect) that I could just plug this thing into a USB port and get a reading. But that's not the case because there's no current to measure unless you actually have something on the other side to complete the circuit. So the reading you're getting is not a measure of the output of the charger so much as it seems to be a combination of the output of the charger AND the amount of power whatever you have plugged in will draw. So if I plug the meter into a 2.1A plug and the other end into a phone, the meter reads .5A because that's what the phone is drawing. Because of this the meter became much less useful to me almost immediately.Also, the dual output setup of this device is rather counter-intuitive. Again, I'm not engineer but if I plug in two devices that should cumulatively draw 2.1A then I still don't get that as a reading in the meter. I'm sure there's a wonderful explanation for this and no doubt someone will provide such an explanation in a comment about 5 seconds after I post this review but the fact remains that as a consumer product this thing is rather confusing. As a technical device it seems spot on with a solid and consistent readout but I'd have a heck of a time explaining this thing to my Grandmother, which, as we know, is the gold standard of general population comprehensibility. If you can explain something to grandma then you can explain it to anyone.In summary, a solid unit for the somewhat deeply technical but not something I'd be prepared to try to explain to granny.","rating":4},{"comment":"Failed in the first week of use.  The V always read correct but the amps started to read a consistent .30 starting the 2nd day then the 6rd day they read 0.0. I tried it on 4 different chargers of different amp output and 5 different cables. Yet the readings were always the exact same.  It seemed like the  device had a short of some sort. All my products stopped getting charged while they were plugged into the device.","rating":2},{"comment":"Great little tool, I especially like the clear dual display. USB 2 but not fully compatible with USB 3 which is not a big issue for analysing charging issues. I am really pleased with the Above TEK Power Meter  and have no hesitation recommending it. If you really need USB 3 for measuring a drive or something the Centech USB power meter does it at more than twice the price but displays only one value at a time.","rating":5},{"comment":"The AboveTEK USB Power Meter is a great tool for measuring voltage and amperage of USB power.Pros:-Very small in size and is black in color-Red display that gives the volts readings and blue color displays the amp reading both at once (readable in the dark)-Reads update every second-Accurate readings (I have a different brand USB meter and it has the same reading)-Can read 0-3 amps and 3-10 volts with accuracy of 1% for both readings-Output 1 can be used to read flash drives in a computer and output 2 can be used fast charging charging high current devices like and iPad and get readings for it at the same time-When both ports are in use, it adds both ports readings together and shows it on the display-Works well for testing the output of battery packs, wall chargers, car chargers, and ect that is plugged into a device like an iPad-Great tool for reviewers, like me, who want to know how the product performed in real world tests-Excellent price compared to others found on Amazon-Great quality-Design is great (it has a short cable running from the USB end to the USB ports so it does not block other portsNo cons found!This is a great USB power meter and I recommend it.I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, for free to keep, and I promised that my review is fair and honest.","rating":5},{"comment":"I broke two Mophies (taking them on and off my phone, the top walls are thin and don't hold up to wear and tear) and I like my Anker well enough but this is a power house!

This is a very small charger that fully charged my ipad air and my iphone 4s and still had a little charge left. It fits well in a briefcase, pocket or bag and has become one of my favorite chargers.","rating":5},{"comment":"I wanted this portable recharging battery for my cell phone, as I go on many motorcycle trips and having my cell run dead is not an option. First off, I like the physical appearance of this device. It has a smooth kind of rubbery texture. It also come with a little LED light, although I find it pretty useless unless you are in extremely dark areas when trying o hook you device up to it. I do like the button that seems to turn the battery pack on, but it will not turn it off, rather you must wait for the auto timer to shut it off for you due to nothing being plugged into it. It charges very fast using the USB port on my Desktop, but I see on the instructions you can also plug in the supplied usb plug into any charging device that may have come with a laptop or cell phone to charge this device even faster.Overall, I give the MyCharge 6000amp Rechargeable Battery pack 4 out of 5 stars, mostly because there are a few gimmicks included that don't really do anything helpful.","rating":4},{"comment":"I have a couple of rechargeable batteries that I use for our phones.  But since my kids keep commandeering them, I needed another one.  I wanted a smaller unit that gave me one or two full charges, and this one fit the bill.  I can get over 2 charges on my IPhone 4S with this unit.  That is more than I need for 99% of my activities, so I am satisfied.It also has a built in flashlight.  At first I thought that was a stupid idea.  Why would I need a flashlight on a rechargeable battery?  Well about 2 months ago I was in a car accident and have been having back pain, so I can't sleep well at night.  So sometimes I read on my kindle or IPad.  Well the battery ran low on the kindle, I grabbed this rechargeable battery and could not find the cable.  So I used the flashlight to find it instead of turning on a light and waking my wife.  Cause waking the wife is always the wrong choice...","rating":5},{"comment":"This is an awesome charger!  I have purchased a few others this year, but this one really won me over.  This one is bigger and more powerful than the others, so I guess it's not really fair to compare them against each other.  This one has charged my phone several times and it still shows three lights on the side, which means it has 50-75% of its juice left for more charging.  I love how I can press a button on the side of this and see how much life it has left in it.  It is also very quick.  If I just plug in my iPhone with a cord to the wall, it would take at least a few hours to get from 50% to 100%.  With this it is about an hour.  Love that!  It also has a flashlight in it, which is handy when you can't find things inside your bag, like me.It is not super heavy, like you might think.  It weighs 4.6 ounces.  I bought another charger that is probably half the size, but weighs almost this same amount. I have only used it to charge up my iPhone, but it could also be great for my iPad mini or whatever other device I have.  It does not come with any cables, but I have plenty so that is not an issue for me.","rating":5},{"comment":"Very compact charger, easy to carry in a pocket or purse, and nice it has a flashlight. Seems very well made and it is easy to charge and use.I recommend, would, and will likely, buy again, and I hope this helps.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have a few of these USB batteries from different manufacturers. All of them are extremely handy for smaller, power hungry devices with limited battery life like iPhones.Compared to the others I own, this one is higher-capacity (6000 mAh \/ 22. watt-hour) than most. 5000 mAh in this size is more typical. I tested it with my iPod 4th generation, and it fully recharged it from dead 6.5 times, so the claimed capacity appears to be about right.Despite the higher capacity, it feels a bit smaller than the others. Actual dimensions are 2.8&#34; x 2.2&#34; x 1.0&#34;, vs. 3.7&#34; x 1.8&#34; x 0.9&#34; for a comparable battery. A little thicker, a little wider, but because it's nearly a full inch shorter, it feels smaller. It's slightly heavier (4.6 oz vs. 4.3), but not noticeably so.Like other current batteries, it charges with a micro-USB cable, it has a built in flashlight and can supply 2.1 amps to properly charge tablets. I rarely have power problems with my tablets, but it's also a good match for smaller, 7&#34; tablets. The 2013 Nexus 7, for example, has an internal battery rated at just shy of 4000 mAh (14.8 watt-hours), so this battery should provide 1.5 charges.If I were shopping for another small USB battery, this is the one I'd get.","rating":5},{"comment":"As a disappointed iPhone 4S user - can't get an upgrade yet - I'm dying all the time as my phone is out before noon, and I need to keep in contact with work, use GPS, tweet, etc. I travel a lot, as well, and it's frequent that there just aren't any outlets available to plug in a phone, so what do I do?I've looked at several cases and such, but never wanted to invest $100 in a case that wouldn't last for a long time. Came across this item, and I'm quite pleased.Pros:- Holds enough charge to fill my phone almost twice. That's great - lets me have plenty of juice when I'm on the road.- Charges using a standard micro USB cable - the same one my Kindle uses, so I don't have to carry two around.- It has a little flashlight that is surprisingly bright. This is helpful in those hotel rooms that don't have a switch anywhere near the bed! Nice little unexpected feature.- The lights show the current charge status, so it's obvious when I need to plug it in and recharge it.- One USB port allows me to charge any number of items, from my Kindle to my iPhone to headphones. I like that.Cons:- It is a bit heavy. It's a big battery, so not unexpected, but every pound starts to count once my bag is full of electronics.","rating":5},{"comment":"I literally own more than 10 different kinds of power banks (Ravpower, Anker, Energizer, Duracell, Targus, lots of others - really small capacity ranging from 1800mah to large 14000mAh) yet I am still impressed with this product and has surprisingly, actually become my most favorite!Pros:- It comes pre-charged! Many power banks I receive are depleted completely or not fully charged. I received this fully charged with 4 bars. Fantastic.- Compact! I have power banks that contain less mAh that's much bulkier and ugly.- I love the soft-touch finish similar to the back of the new Nexus 7 tablets - it feels great!- It works with charging the PS Vita! A lot of power banks aren't capable of charging the PS Vita - it's very picky - but I was surprised this was able to charge it!- Fast charging outputs at 2.4A! Impressive.- Battery level status- Simple flash light (I mean it's no Ravpower RP-PB08 flashlight brightness, but it's still nice feature)The device has a button for power\/battery status and flash light.You may find a charger with more capacity for the price, but you definitely won't get the compact size, the nice rubber build feel quality, fast charging, and capable of charging picky devices like the PS Vita.The only thing that would have made this better is if it had two USB ports as opposed to one for simultaneous charging.Although I've owned many power banks already, this has become my favorite charger that I will always be taking with me. I highly recommend this charger without hesitation. This is a quality charger really capable of charging your phone more than once.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is my third small external battery pack, and so far I am really pleased with the results.  I have a RavPower (14000mAh) which is fittingly double the size of the myCharge 6000 and heavier but works great.  My other lip-stick smaller jackery never worked well, and was a waste of time.  The myCharge, with the 6000 mAh battery works great for a small pocket-sized device.  It comes with it's own USB-to-micro-USB 2-foot long cable.  It has a flashlight, but I don't need a tiny itty bitty flashlight.It measures about 3&#34; x 2 1\/4&#34; and easily slips into a pocket with the same thickness as my wallet.  It comes charged out of the box and I got three charges out of it on my Samsung phone.  I re-charged the myCharge to test it again and so far I have gotten 3 full charges (from about 5%, anything under 10%, my phone dies in minutes) and still have one of the four monitor lights blinking with a little juice left in it.  Impressive!  And recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"I recently traveled to LA and Chicago for business. And as many travelers know, electrical outlets are a premium when sitting at the gate in an airport. Delta hubs are generous to have plenty of outlet stations by the gates, but I am usually stuck at United and US Air hubs that leave a lot to be desired in terms of business comforts. So I usually carry 2 portable charges with me everywhere I do so that I may work on the iPad, take calls on my phone, and keep my Bluetooth devices with a good charge for when I need them while driving.During this past trip, I only took the myCharge Amp Max Rechargeable 6000 mAh Battery with me as a test of its performance. In a safe test environment, my hotel room, I let my iPad drain to about 15% of its battery and my phone to 10%, I plugged in the iPad first then my phone. While continuing to use the iPad, its battery level rose to 55% in about 45 minutes and my iPhone was fully charged within one hour. And remarkably, the myCharge still had more power in it. I unplugged both devices and charged the battery back up and it had a full charge in just under 90 minutes.That unofficial test is something I have never seen replicated with other portable batteries that I have wasted money on. And the size of the myCharge is not overwhelming. I was truly amazed and feel that having the device will allow me to keep multiple devices plugged in while confident that I don't need to strategically wait to use my devices fearing a loss of total battery power.Last note regarding the flashlight feature - I haven't seen the need for it yet. i bet they manufacturer could have saved some room on the size of the battery if the light was removed or never included in the design. But that is minimal.I fully recommend the myCharge Amp Max Rechargeable 6000 mAh Battery for any business traveler that wants a lot of power in a small device.","rating":5},{"comment":"Very impressed with this portable rechargeable battery. Previously I used theKensington PowerLift Backup Battery and Dock for iPhone 4 and 3G\/3GS - Charger - Retail Packaging - Black. It worked, sometimes. After 6 month of use I got temperamental connections where my phone would connect and disconnect continually. I'd have to keep pulling the connector out and reinserting it until it connected. One thing about the Kensington is it's a one time use before you need to recharge it. If you were charging your phone from 0%, it would take the full battery of the rechargeable battery then would die. The myCharge Amp is incredible because it has so much battery life to spare, even after charging my iPhone from 3%-75% I still had 5 bars on my battery indicator. This is such a cool gadget, great rubber texture, flashlight is an awesome bonus because why not include one? There's not much you can tack onto a rechargeable battery as \"extra,\" but a battery is a great touch! Light up battery indicator at the touch of a button. This is so well worth the money.My real life experience: out this weekend when my iPhone died and turned off when I needed to get in touch with my family. Plugged my phone into the charger and within a minute the screen came back and I could access my phone. This would have never happened as quickly with the Kensington charger, and my car charger. Also, it's cool to walk around with my phone and use it while it charging. The battery is very light weight and easy to carry both phone and battery around.What I really wish... it came with a small felt bag so I could keep it together with a phone connector for an emergency. I have one so I will put it together as a kit, but would be great if the company included one.FANTASTIC PRODUCT!!","rating":5},{"comment":"On a recent 6 hour flight over the Pacific, my Kindle FireHDX7 ran low (28%) on power, so I decided to test the myCharge and hooked it up. During the charge, I played a game for 15 minutes, then closed the Kindle. About an hour or so later, I flipped open the Kindle and was surprised to see it charged to 97%. There were two lights remaining on the myCharge.I like the compact shape of the charger and it fits in the small zippered pouch I carry my cords and adapters in. The flashlight is handy for finding stuff in the bottom of dark backpacks (or luggage-sized purses!) at night on a plane, too.I would certainly recommend this product.","rating":5},{"comment":"Solid charger that works well, charges gadgets quickly and is also pretty speedy at charging itself. The size and weight is in line with my 2 other 6000+ mAh chargers, I like the rectangular design, it's easier to fit into spaces in my electronics packing cube than the rounded shape of my Anker Astro 6000 mAh.I have a first generation Kindle Fire that can be very fussy about chargers (and cords), and this unit charged it with no issues.Charging\/discharging speeds are faster than my Anker - not a scientific test - just charged two identical phones that were both down to 1 bar each, one with my Anker and one with the MyCharge, the MyCharge phone was done about 40 minutes before the Anker phone, which completed in 3.5 hours.I like the light, although it's not a major selling point for me - seems like most of the newer chargers are offering one. I also like that this uses a regular USB cable rather than attached plugs - I can bring a short or long cord depending on my anticipated use, and I don't have to have cords with it that don't fit my devices.Most importantly, this charger has a battery level indicator - I've owned some cheaper units that didn't have an indicator, which is beyond frustrating, especially when you're counting on having a charge available and the unit is depleted!Overall, it's a good solid unit. If you need a fast charger that is compact and offers consistent results, this is a good option. If you don't need the speed, I'd save the money and go for something like the Anker, RavPower, or PowerGen.","rating":4},{"comment":"I had been wanting one of these rechargers for a while, and this myCharge product has been great so far.  It charges my Samsung Galaxy Mini phone from almost dead to full in less than 2 hours.  I also was able to charge my Kindle reader, which was completely dead, to full battery within an hour.  And after charging the phone twice & the Kindle once, this thing was still half full!It is smaller than I thought it would be, and fits in my purse or tote with ease.  The finish is smooth and velvety, which doesn't slip around as easily as glossy finish products.The packaging for this was also nice, just easy-opening cardboard, no plastic shells that have to be cut through.The only thing I would have liked that this did not have - a recharging cable that plugs into a wall socket or an included USB wall adaptor.  The cable that comes with this is reversible, so you plug the mini-USB side (that normally goes into your devices) into the charging port on this product, and plug the USB side into a computer or a USB wall adaptor.  This is handy in some respects as far as portability, so having a USB wall adaptor would have been a nice inclusion with this product.","rating":4},{"comment":"This little thing is a charging dynamo! Right out of the box, I charged the following devices:1. iPhone 5S. The iPhone battery was at 83% battery, and it was fully charged in about 45 minutes.2. Pebble Smart Watch. The Pebble took just a few minutes to get fully charged from 80%.3. iPod. The iPod battery was completely drained and wouldn't turn on until I plugged it into the charger. I let it charge for 5 hours before I had to disconnect. The iPod battery was at a little over 50% charged.4. IPad3. This drained the initial charge on the myCharge. The iPad went from 53% to 88% in about 3 hours.I did not use any of the devices while charging them. The myCharge barely got warm through all of this. The charger is extremely portable at only 2 3\/4\" x 2\" x 3\/4\". A power button on the side shows four LED's when fully charged. There is also a nice little LED flashlight that works great, although it's not the brightest, and it works even after the device battery life is fully discharged. There is a soft, rubbery-like feel to the coating of the device that keeps it from sliding around on a surface.I recommend that you charge the myCharge using an AC adapter connection, rather than just the USB cable. It is much, much faster. A great little addition to a travel bag or briefcase!","rating":5},{"comment":"I had very high expectations for this recharger, but they were largely disappointed. Given the number of gadgets that I have accumulated that require charging I have need of rechargers. I have two others that I am very happy with. Taking this one out of the box I assumed that this was going to join the others. And it had some features that I really liked, such as the four lights that would show the strength of the remaining charge. Unfortunately the charger failed to meet those initial expectations. Of the three chargers I now own, this is far and away the worst at charging. But sadly, of the three I own, it is the slowest and most difficult of my chargers to recharge itself. So it provided the smallest bang for the buck. I meant that figuratively, though being literally, this was the most expensive of the three.So despite how attractive this is as a physical object, I cannot recommend this charger.","rating":2},{"comment":"I agree with the other reviewers generally and won't reiterate details about charging times and such. Suffice to say, this works great and the best feature in my opinion is how small and lightweight this gizmo is, only weighing just over 4 ounces while still packing a lot of power, enough to charge my iPad Mini. Most small size chargers, like the lipstick shaped ones, are weak at only 2500 mah or so and are only good enough to charge a phone (if they work at all), not a tablet. This charger is tiny, smaller than the palm of my hand, and is great if you want to carry one with great capability in your purse or backpack.  It's very unisex looking, just a nice black cube. Works perfect and I'm really happy with the quality\/ lightweight combo. I'm not naming names, but I've tried a few of the cute compact ones and they are cheaply made and either don't work or barely work charging a phone and no way do they have the power to charge a tablet. This one works great and is still compact. It's an excellent product. The only thing that could make it better is if it included a short charging cord for my iPhone\/iPad, but from experience I'm learning that most knock off cords are rejected by my Apple products so that may be way it's not included. This exceeds my expectations and is a terrific lightweight, compact, powerful charger at a reasonable price and I'm very happy with it. And as one reviewer notes, the little flashlight actually comes in handy too.","rating":5},{"comment":"This unit has a built in flashlight, similar to other units I own.

Overall it is a very good and reliable charger. Highly recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"So far, I love this little charger.I have a couple other portable power sources, and this is my favorite.Just to be very clear: It comes with one USB-to-micro-USB connector. There is no USB wall plug-in and no charging cable for your device.PROS:* It is teeny tiny! It is smaller than a deck of cards, except that it's a little thicker. It is small enough to fit into a pocket in your jeans (front or back).* Since it uses a long charging cord, you can hold the charger in your pocket while you use your phone (walking around the store or exercising or whatever), or put your phone in one pocket and the charger in another. I have another charger with short built-in connectors, so I have to hold the big charger AND the phone in one hand while I use the other hand to operate the phone. If I want to charge the phone while I'm not using it, I have to put the big charger and my phone together in one pocket, which makes my hoodie hang lower on one side. This is so much better!* Because of how this device charges, you can connect it (using the included cable) to your own USB charging port, and then connect your phone\/device to the charger (using your own cable).  Since the phone and the charger are plugged in, they'll both charge, and the cables are long enough that you can continue to use your phone. Because of the length of the cables, you can plug this setup into a taller wall outlet without having the device and your phone hanging in the air (which is what happens with chargers that have short built-in plugs and connectors). Also, you can use a small wall unit that only takes up one outlet instead of covering two or more.* Cool low-power flashlight! Why not?* Four white indicator LEDs are more accurate than red\/yellow LEDs on some battery packs.* The surface feels nice and soft, which is probably weird to care about, but I like it.* Since it plugs into a cable and not a wall outlet, I can leave the cable hanging out on my desk, and it's much easier to plug in than it would be if I had to reach behind the computer and try to plug the whole device into the surge protector.CONS:* The unit does not come with a USB charging port of its own, so if you want to charge it, you have to have extras in strategic places, use a hard-wired one (on a computer or car dashboard, for instance), or carry your usual charging setup around along with the unit. Extra cables mean that the charging setup isn't as small as it could be. You have to provide your own phone-charging cable, too.* Even if you don't need to charge the unit on the go, you still have to carry a cable to charge your phone\/device. If there were a built-in or mini-sized connector option, it would take up less room. I might try to find one on Amazon.* The flashlight isn't very strong, and you have to hold the button down the whole time or the light goes off (this may lessen energy waste by preventing light from turning on and staying on in backpack).* No way to prevent buttons from being pushed in bag or pocket, no covers or protection for USB ports.* Kind of expensive for the capacity and lack of connectors.* If you leave it plugged in, with your phone charging from it, the charger sometimes quits charging and the phone displays no charging connection. This is usually after the phone has charged completely and is running down again (at 99 or 98%), but it's happened once at a random time. Not that big of a deal in most cases, and you can manually start charging by pressing the button on the side.* The ports on the device aren't recessed at all, so the connectors stick way out, and don't seat very closely anyway, so I'm worried I'll bend something if there are cables connected while it's in my pocket or bag.I wish the connector setup were less clunky, and it'd come with a wall port, but all-in-all, this battery pack is great! I'm so glad I got it.","rating":5},{"comment":"","rating":4},{"comment":"Used for 3 days and returned. Get better results from my a7 for stills. Video is just a pain because you can't get 4k with external recorder. My Gh4 is way better. ( not in low light of course) no stabilization either. A lot of hype people. 12mp sensor does just not cut it.","rating":2},{"comment":"Maybe not for everyone but for my shooting, the A7s is nearly ideal. I'm still test driving it but image files at reasonably higher ISOs (1600, 3200, 6400) look cleaner (less noise) than the high end cameras I've been using. Even 10,000 ISO looks good. I'm all for smaller, lighter, quieter in a full-frame and this fits the bill. So far, as expected, continuous autofocus doesn't seem a match for cameras like the Nikon D3s and D600 but I'm trying a Sony A-Mount 70-300 with an adapter and that is fairly speedy.","rating":5},{"comment":"The intended market for this camera clearly is not photographers. Most photographers won't understand or appreciate the video capabilities of the A7s. Just because it is shaped like a stills camera, doesn't mean that is what it was engineered for. So if you're a photographer, go for the Sony A7 or A7r.For video professionals and genuine film-maker enthusiasts, you should really take a serious look at the Sony A7s. Why? Because under the hood, it is loaded with pro level video features (not to mention a full frame sensor) only found on cameras that cost 10 times as much. I'm not going to list all the video features that make this one of the very best video cameras on the planet, you need to do your own evaluation. But, if you're seeking a plan-sized camera with video\/audio performance unmatched by any other DSLR... look no further than the Sony A7s.","rating":5},{"comment":"I do not do many Amazon reviews for cameras as I have a huge review website for this purpose. But every once in a while a special camera comes along that does almost everything so so right. It is then I feel the need to come here and write a short review on Amazon. The A7s is one of those cameras.I have used every camera made over the past 7 years. ALL of them, even DSLRs. I only review and write about the ones that move me, the ones I like, the ones that offer something special whether that is in the form of usability, IQ, abilities, lenses, versatility, etc.The A7s offers so much, that it is probably the favorite camera I have ever reviewed or used in 7 years. I have loved and adored many cameras for what they offer. The Olympus E-M1 is a micro 4\/3 masterpiece. The lenses for that system are the best there is. The Sony RX1 and RX1r..magical and quite special once you know how to use it and exploit what it offers. The Leica M 240, again, it can provide an emotional experience while delivering class leading IQ.But today I am talking about the virtues and benefits of the Sony A7s. I find it sad that many just look at the words \"12MP\" and assume it is not good for photos. NONSENSE 100%, and that is a fact.In reality, 12MP is more than 99.8% of us will ever need (see my review at my site for more on this) ad I can make beautiful 20X30 prints from an A7s file (just got one back today) just as I used to do with my 4MP Nikon D2hs. Huge MP is NOT needed for large prints! Now if you want to shoot massively detailed landscapes, go for medium format as that will deliver what you need more than any 35mm based camera. For everything else, the A7s is plenty.Now there are those who are \"pixel peepers\", who only get enjoyment from viewing their images 100% on a computer screen (which is not a way to view a photo and has nothing to do with real photography). If this is you then you will need a 36MP monster to satisfy your needs.The A7s has LOADS going for it over  an A7 or A7r, below are a few of those things:1. Low light abilities - I am NOT talking high ISO here, I am talking Auto Focus ability. This camera has an uncanny ability to focus in pitch blackness, even without the AF assist light. You will never be in a situation where the A7s cannot focus.2. High ISO - As of July 2014, there is NOTHING that can touch this fro high ISO use. I have decided that I can now go up to ISO 102,000 and have a usable image. Color stays, DR stays. Amazing. ISO 6400 is like many cameras at ISO 400. This opens up all kinds of creative possibilities and things no one has ever been able to do before. It is significant just for that reason alone.3. AF Speed. This is faster to Af than the A7 and A7s, no question.4. Quiet - This camera is much quieter than the A7 and A7r and can even be shot in SILENCE. As in ZERO noise. I shot a scene at ISO 80k in a dark room. No one knew I took the shot and it was quiet in a room that echoed severely. No one would have believed me if I  told them I took a shot as it was seemingly impossible to do without a flash.5. Video - Amazing video capabilities even at ISO 102,000.6. Leica M Glass friendly - The A7 and A7r and even the Leica M itself has issues with some wide angle M mount lenses (the M 240 has issues with 3rd party wides) that create colored edges and unusable color images. The A7s is the 1st full frame digital that can use a lens like the 15 Voigtlander without any real issues, IN COLOR! This is huge for those with Leica M glass. Huge. I use the 15, 35 1.2 and others and they look beautiful, in some cases beating what comes from the M240 in good light. Low light? The Leica can not compete with the A7s.7. AWB and color - The AWB and color is improved with the A7s over the A7 and A7r, this is a fact.So there are just 7 of the reasons the A7s is way more useful than the A7 or A7r for my tastes. Resolution, again, 12MP is plenty for any web use and any print size 99.9% of us will print. If you are a person who is into photography and NOT pixel peeping you will adore this camera without question. It opens up all kinds of possibilities that were never there before. Slap on a 50 0.95 from Mitakon or even Leica and your world will be rocked.The camera is solid, has a great EVF and LCD and the ONLY complaint I have is that it does not have in body IS. If it had the Olympus 5 Axis IS it would be my dream camera. Really.New lenses are on the way and even Zeiss has some amazing new offerings coming in MF lenses that will work with the Sony. For me, this 12MP beauty is all I really need but I still am emotionally attached to my Leica M and Olympus E-M1 ;)To those who gave this camera low ratings or say it is no good for photos, you are wrong. It's superb for photo or video and beats out most cameras i have used in recent years. You can see tons of photos in my review if you just google for it.Sure there will always be new cameras..an A7x or A7T..but for now, July 2014, this one is at the top of the Sony Heap for me.The A7s for me gets 5 stars.","rating":5},{"comment":"Works great. Good picture quality. Easy to use. I leave it up all the time in direct sunlight and it still functions normally. It's only been about a month so I'm still not convinced that it won't fail as a result of the heat but so far so good. I read around before purchasing and this model seemed to be the best. Vision at night is ok but you can only really see what your headlights light up. I thought the screen was supposed to time out and cut off after a couple of minutes but that may have been another cam I was looking at while shopping around. It's not too bright to be a distraction though. The mount is good enough to set it and forget it but may be a problem if your constantly removing and replacing and not gentle. I give it 4 stars because it's good enough so far. I'll give it 5 later if it continues to hold up.*Update*Screen does timeout. It's in the settings.*Update Again*5 Stars Now. I'm satisfied. Still have not took it down. Works every time. Direct sunlight in a closed car is not an issue. For those leaving bad reviews I suggest giving it another try.

So far I am fairly happy with the camera.  The video quality can't be beat. And while have have not yet had the opportunity to give it a full shake down night time drive, I have been happy with the results of the test I have run on it to date in my driveway at night.The CONS:First, the manual that come with this thing is low quality garbage. Fortunately, the device's menu is fairly straightforward and if you have ever used a digital camera, you should have no problem configuring this one.The Mirco SD card slot does not appear to be spring loaded as the manual says, so you have to get a finger nail or knife or something in there to get the card out. (I will play with it some more to see if more pressure helps).There is a \"G-Sensor\" setting but I can find nothing in the manual that says what the G sensor does. On my old camera when it detected a shock it would flag that segment of recording so the camera would not overwrite it when space became an issue. Not sure what it does here.My old camera also had a button on the back that I could press to lock the current recording segment from deletion should something interesting occur. This camera seem to lack that feature as well.But again, given the image quality and price, even with these issues this is still a good deal.UPDATE 07\/18\/2014: The SD slot is spring loaded for removal it just needs to be pushed in quite far.UPDATE 07\/19\/2014: Although the camera \"officially\" supports only up to a 32GB SD card.

Because this version of the dash cam does not have a battery, it is not getting hot when parked under the sun for many hours. I had the one with the battery and when you touch it, it felt really hot, almost to the point of exploding.For the price, you are getting every dollar worth of it.

The bass and the treble sound wonderful. Played many different genres including Rock, Classical, Folk, Country and even listened to several of my drum songs. All of these played exceptionally well!+ Controls on the front of the speaker for forward to next song, back to next song, increase sound and decrease sound.+ Combo USB Charging\/Audio Plug - To play this speaker on a NON BLUETOOTH device such as a radio or CD Player, even older PC do this: Plug in the Micro USB end into the speaker, then plug in the Audio 3.5 end into the CD Player, Radio, computer and it will play the music with the speaker without requiring a Bluetooth connection.

The body is made of metal with a \"Gun Metal\" machined finish.  Since this one uses metal it has a premium feel, considering most speakers on the market only offer a plastic build.The sound quality is great with ample bass and treble, even sounds good at higher volumes. For the small of the speaker it produces some room filling sound.There are other great features such as the phone function, Micro SD Card Slot, FM radio, and AUX port. When making phone calls the microphone makes good clean clips calls. The SD card slot is perfect when wanting to play music from a storage card. The FM radio function works and sounds like a normal radio. For the best radio reception, insert the charging cord into the charging port for an antenna. Also, there is an AUX input for a wired connection, which increases battery life.I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a small cylindrical wireless speaker.Outside: It's got a modern chrome look and is pretty heavy for its size.

I would recommend this product to anyone wanting a bluetooth device, mp3 player with extras, or an FM radio with extras.[sample provided]","rating":5},{"comment":"I've owned a number of EasyAcc speakers over the past year so I've watched their product line evolve. The difference between this one and some of the earlier models I have is like night and day - and in a good way.What I love about the review sample that I received is the sound. This speaker is about 2.5 inches in diameter and two inches tall, yet it puts put a full, rich sound with decent low end, and a nicely balanced mid and high range. Music, especially the circa 1950s jazz to which I listen, sounds fantastic.Of course, sound is the most important feature, but there are others that set this speaker apart. Foremost (to me) is the way this beacons its presence to any bluetooth device as soon as you turn it on. Earlier speakers, including models from EasyAcc, required you to jump through hoops to pair and connect. As soon as I turned this one on I scanned from my phone and it immediately showed up. A touch of my finger paired and connected it. Yet another thing I love is the buttons are conveniently placed and the is no multifunction button that was one of the trickiest and most confusing controls on an earlier generation of speakers from just about every manufacturer.This is also feature rich with a radio, speaker, hand's free connection to your phone and even an SD card slot. The radio is functional, but a bit clumsy since it will scan and remember stations, but if you are the type to station hop among favorites you will be frustrated. But the key point is that it does contain a radio and it gets surprisingly good reception (I tested it on a local station that is normally marginal and the signal locked and was clear.)You get about four hours of play time from a two hour charge, which is sufficient for me. This is designed to be a personal speaker, so mine will spend most of its life on a desk teetered to a charging cable anyway.Bottom line: this is a great speaker at an impulse-buy price. If you are looking for a mini entertainment center for your desk, work or leisure space this one merits serious consideration.","rating":5},{"comment":"This thing looks and sounds great for its size... really clear highs and punchy bass.

This speaker breaks the trend, with bluetooth, microSD, and even FM radio. Overall, I loved this speaker, especially considering the affordable price, but I did have a few issues with it.Pros:1. This speaker is LOUD! Obviously, it's not going to rival studio level audio equipment, but for something that fits in the palm of your hand, this is a loud little speaker2. Battery life exceeds the rated 4-5 hours. I recorded 6 hours, and it was still playing strong and loud. Any device hooked up to this speaker will die before the speaker dies3. A 360 light adds a nice touch, that also tells you when it's paired with bluetooth4. This speaker is heavy, which is a good and bad quality. The metal housing would likely hold up better from drops, but something heavier may not be perfect for portabilityCons:1. No travel bag included... for a portable speaker2. Combined skip forward\/back with volume buttons don't work well. It's really easy to skip the song if you want to raise the volume3. While the speaker is loud, the sound quality isn't as incredible. Still WAY better than phone speakers though4. Included FM radio is basically useless. I got no signal and it just seems like a wasted additionI received a sample of this speaker from EasyAcc for this review. My comments on this speaker are honest and unbiased. Otherwise, I wouldn't include the cons I noticed while testing it out. Non of the cons are product-breaking issues, and I still found a lot of value in this product.","rating":4},{"comment":"I bought this keyboard on a whim, despite the few reviews available (4 as of this posting). While two of them were provided review samples, their reviews were positive enough to give me a good feeling about buying this folio keyboard case.POSITIVE:-The case is well constructed and sturdy.-The outside feels like a hard leather book and the inside is lined with a soft felt that should protect the iPad Air quite nicely.-The keys feel quite comfortable, with a good amount of throw and feedback. They're slightly concave so that your fingers don't slip off and feel about as good as most laptops.-The magnet that you attach the iPad to for &#34;laptop mode&#34; is pretty strong. It didn't pull my iPad out of the slots like the other reviewer's showed, but it's plenty strong enough to handle vigorous tapping against the screen.-The plastic slots that hold your iPad feel durable. I'm directly comparing this to the Logitech Folio Keyboard case, where there were quite a few complaints about the plastic slots breaking (including the first one I bought for my fiancee's iPad).-There's no sleep mode as far as I can tell, but the Anker can sense when you disconnect from the magnet and will disconnect the keyboard as well. I haven't tested the battery life, but I suspect it should last a good long time.-The price. This is less than half the cost of the equivalent Logitech at the time of this posting.-Pretty much no keyboard lag. I type pretty fast and it does not seem to lag behind.NEGATIVE:-This is a problem with all keyboards for tablets, but the keys do feel a little cramped. The Logitech folio case has a slight edge over this one because it found a way to space out the keys better (at the expense of making the layout a little odd to get used to). Honestly though, if you're doing a lot of work on your iPad for an extended amount of time, all of these cases are going to make you sacrifice ergonomics for convenience.-There is only one angle for you to use, so hopefully you're at the right height for it. It happens to be optimal for me, but I could see someone taller or shorter having issues. More angle options would have been nice.-There's not really a way to keep the case shut. The magnet used for locking\/unlocking the screen isn't strong enough to hold the case closed (I'm not sure I would want it to, as that strong a magnet brings in more problems than it solves), but some sort of clasp would have been nice. I'll probably end up putting some elastic band on it or something.-Only comes in one color (black). Works for my Space Grey iPad, but if I had a white one I'd probably prefer an assortment of colors to choose from. It does seem like I bought this early on in its lifecycle, so maybe Anker has plans for more colors.Overall, I have a very positive impression of this case. As always, Anker has put an impressive product for much less than the cost of its competitors, which makes it a great value. Beyond the few nitpicky things I had, I would recommend this for people who need a keyboard and case in one.","rating":5},{"comment":"I am typing this review from my new Anker keyboard case. I have tried so many cases for mobile devices over the years for various devices, frankly it is hard to get quality products these days. In american culture cheap unfortunately wins... I am so glad Anker doesnt subscribe to this. Im sure they would sell a lot more if their cases were 16.99 but some of us still want something that is well designed and will still hold up.OK about the keyboard. There are command buttons that control everything from brightness to sound volume and track skipping. The keys are smaller than a typical keyboard but it doesn't take too long to get used to it. also it automatically turns off and on depending on if your ipad is in the proper position for typing which is awesome as well.Buy it.","rating":5},{"comment":"Bullets: Good materials, needs more protectionAnker gave me this product in exchange for my honest feedback, so I'll do my best to write an accurate, unbiased review.This should really be a 4.5 star product, but since Amazon doesn't alllow half stars, I will try to bring a counterpoint to all the perfect scores that this product has so far. The fit and finish on this keyboard are on par with other Anker products, which, is to say, excellent. Battery life seems to be good, as it hasn't run out on me yet, after testing it out for two weeks.The synthetic microsuede material is a welcome change to the glossy plastic on some of the other cases. The materials alone should put this at a five star rating, as they have a feel to them that you wouldn't see at this pricepoint. Key travel and feel are good, given the size that it has to be incorporated into, however, the delete button continues to be small. Priced at only $5 more than their slim cases, the price point is very good.Drawbacks to this case that lead me to take off a star are: lack of side ipad protection and the single angle for typing. The side protection for the ipad itself is really minimal, and could easily be fixed with longer pieces of plastic to encircle the ipad. Likewise, the magnets holding the cover closed are inadequate, and I have seen the cover popping open as I simulated it being jostled in a carrying bag. As there is a magnetic switch that holds the ipad in the lone angle that it supports, moving it from this angle breaks the connection to the keyboard, so it cannot be used outside the case. Both of these drawbacks can be overlooked when using the case on a table, but in other environments (say the tray table on a plane) it just doesn't seem like the ideal product.I'd like to give this product a solid 4.5 stars, however I don't think that I can in good conscience round it up to a full 5 stars. Overall, this is a very well made, high quality product, and if you can overlook these shortcomings, then it should be a 5 for you.","rating":4},{"comment":"&#9830;&#9830;&#9830;Scroll to Update at the End Bottom of This Review to See Why I Deducted Two Stars After 10 Days Use&#9830;&#9830;&#9830;I'm willing to spend more $$$ if it'll get me the best. Thus, for my iPad Air, I've probably spend $200 to $300 testing out different keyboards, usually costing $75 or more. Six months ago or so, when I felt I had finally arrived at the ultimate Bluetooth Keyboard case, the Logic Fabricskin. But recently, as many other reviewers have reported, mine cracked at the hinge where you slide in your iPad.Frustrated, I decided to get anything regard of the price. Amazingly, I wound up buying this $30 Anker keyboard and liking it quite a bit.While it's bland looking on the outside, I like it because:-- Keyboard has a nice solid feel, with keys that have a travel to them that you normally don't see except with with higher end notebooks.-- Exterior reminds me of a texture of a book.-- Just the right weight, feels good and doesn't feel too heavy.-- Bluetooth paired easily and, no hiccups in daily use.The keyboard layout is smaller, but it didn't take too long to get acclimated. As well, I do wish it came in some cool colors. But at this price, being limited on color choice is non-issue.All in all, it deserves 5 star rating.Wednesday, July 23 2014 -- Here's Why I Deducted Two StarsBefore writing reviews, I use products for several days to develop a genuine feel for how they'll perform over long-term use. Unfortunately, issues can still crop up weeks or months later. In this instance here are two problems that arose with the Anker Keyboard that caused me to deduct two stars after 10 days of use.-- Bluetooth often loses connection. While this has happened to other Bluetooth keyboards I've owned, there have been no instances where the disconnect happened this often, i.e. once or twice per session.-- The Annoying Clip. As other reviewers have pointed out, there is a clip that holds the iPad in place when you open the case. To pull the iPad into typing position, you have to yank it out of the clip. Honestly, I find that it requires more force than should be necessary. A magnet would be better. I did read at least one review that said it becomes easier after a week or so, but -- I use my iPad all day long, I've yet to notice it loosening up. To make matters worse, it is cause a tendinitis issue in my right hand to flare up.All in all, considering that the Anker is far less expensive that many other keyboards you'll consider and plus -- continues to shine in other areas as pointed out in the rest of my review -- it is still worth you consideration. Anker is a great company and I am the happy owner of many of their products.","rating":3},{"comment":"Notes:This product was provided for me as a review unit purely for testing purposes, I promise that this review was\/is made in honesty and is fair in its judgments of the product.Design:The Folio Case is encase in a synthetic leather exterior that feels great to the touch, its nice, grippy and feels premium at the same time. The inside of the case is covered in a felt material similar the Surface Type covers though ever slightly softer and smoother to glide your fingers across, its feels great against your skin while typing. However, the design only lets the iPad ever be at one angle to use the keyboard. Its generally a good angle though and I don't have much complaints in that area, though it'd be nice to have at least 2 angles, say for viewing something while standing.Hardware:Key responsiveness is relatively excellent here, the response time feels like there is no lag from input to use, which is good - and the key response certainly helps with giving a solid non-hollow feel when writing. This solid feel allows a better work flow, and with no redundancy in having to go back and correct every other word which may have missing letters, this is a definite recommendation over the comparable BT keyboard options from Anker if you're looking for portability and a great feeling keyboard. It types far better than the Ultra Slim I formerly used for my BT keyboard needs and doesn't skip a beat between words. There is an excellent amount of travel (The distance to actuation of keys.) Using the keyboard you'll start off a bit skeptical with its small footprint and not expect much but after some use the small layout is nice for not straining hand motion and since the keys feel solid the experience is pleasant and remarkable for such a thin form factor.Issues:It is a tad annoying having an auto wake and off function relegated to the iPad magnets, genius and overly concernful at the same times. It is quite annoying in the respect that I can't use the keyboard without potentially having the tablet in a certain position only, also some slits in the stand's preferred position would be great. Though the angle really isn't too bad don't be expecting to be able to use this like a Laptop if you have a busy glare-filled work environment, where adjusting angles isn't as easy with this sort of device while keeping utility, also though great as an all in one it is a bit too crowded for use with itty bitty desks available in colleges, so consider that as well. Your arms will often either to be too cramped to type from the position or wishing that you brought a real laptop - this is great for the mini keyboard on the go for study sessions or areas with big tables\/desks.Wishes:I wish the keyboard was bigger, every time going into integrated keyboard cases you think it's a great idea however you sacrifice an immense amount of space and the typing experience suffers. Though I will say adjustment to the smaller keyboard is relatively swift after a few minutes of typing. What really helps is the great feel. In addition I hope a future iteration will come with an on vs auto switch for those that would prefer keeping the device on rather than having it shut off with the slightest movement.Extraneous Info:Battery is a whopping 800mAh, great for an integrated battery on a Bluetooth keyboard and should last outstandingly long with the auto on and off features, charge time was fast with it as well (around 2 hours charging from my laptop), especially considering the fact that this may well last 6 months with daily usage from a charge of a few hours. The thickness is roughly a small hardcover notebook though I don't expect most people to carry this around as a standalone item without their backpack or bags when they plan to be productive. It'll fit relatively well in your hand or arms but does add some girth and heft to it, I guess its a good thing this is for the iPad Air though, right?","rating":5},{"comment":"This is the fourth keyboard case I bought for my iPad Air.  I didn't use any of the other three for more than a day because there was something I didn't like about each one.  But I really wanted a keyboard case because I hate the virtual keyboard (Tim, ever heard of Swype?  It's great, you should try it sometime!) and I figured the only way to find one I liked was to keep buying different ones.  I'm happy to say I can stop wasting my money, because I finally found this Anker.  It's well-made and sturdy, and the magnet that holds the iPad in place in the typing position is strong enough to actually work.  Most importantly, the keyboard itself is very good.  Of course it is smaller than a regular keyboard, but the action of the keys is smooth, requiring just the right amount of force to depress.  There is no noticeable lag before the letters appear on the screen, and I haven't had any problem with one keystroke sending double characters like I did with the last one I tried.  I've only had the Anker a few days, but at this point I think I may never take it off the iPad again.","rating":5},{"comment":"I was given these ear buds for my birthday and I couldn't wait to use them as soon as they were paired up to my Note 3.  They are lightweight, fit easily around the neck or bottom of the head and fit onto the ear.  The balance seem really good to me but I am not an audiophile but someone that likes a good quality sound. The cord is thick so will not tangle at all, and also a good length for me when I am working out.  I have been downloading music for my playlist and having a grand ole time with them.  Maybe after a while I might find something not going so well, but for now I am enjoying them.July 20th.  So, I have been using them for a while, outside of working out, and I still do like them, however, they can hurt the ear. I try to position them where it is more comfortable,this is mainly after I have had them in for a few hours.  What I have found it that the \"right\" ear with all the buttons does not have the same strong sound as the left. Maybe it is because of the buttons, or maybe because it seems the base is in that ear. Whichever it is, I do find that a little annoying. It is a good product but would like to know how to rectify this problem with the right.  I did switch sides to see if it was my ear being blocked a little,but the sound was the same on left ear as well..","rating":5},{"comment":"These earbuds are very comfortable and I use them to workout with.  They are moisture resistance and tangle free.  These earbuds have a 5 hour of listening time.

These were far and away the lightest pair I've used. They go on easily, are comfortable both while running and during other activities. They stay in my ear very well. I don't have to constantly adjust them while running. The earbuds are reasonably comfortable. They paired quickly and easily and they hold enough charge for four to five 30 - 40 runs. My only real complaint is the sound quality is only adequate. They don't sound bad, but you won't mistake these for symphony quality sound. I consider the sound quality good enough for exercising. I might pick something different if I were listening to music on a 12 hour airplane ride.","rating":4},{"comment":"This headset very quickly connected to my phone and tablet. The sound is a rich sound and I found that the bass and treble had a good range. Another thing that I like about this headset is that it is so comfortable on my head and does not slip off when I work out.In addition, I use this headset when I watch a video and watching a movie.If you are searching for a lightweight and comfortable Bluetooth headset, I highly suggest this one to you.[Provided by I&S; for testing and review purposes]. Very happy to report that this headset has exceeded my expectations and I am very happy with it.","rating":5},{"comment":"The headsets are very light, almost weightless on the head. They clock in at 17 grams, which is less than \"3 Quarters\".There is a round cord attaching them together, that will never twist or tangle. All of the functions are done on from the right ear, ranging from power\/pairing, call answer\/end volume up\/down, and track previous\/next. The charging port is hidden at the bottom of the right ear.Once on the head, the round cable has a memory, which acts like a light spring to keep it softly pressed on your neck.

Sweat doesn't seem to bother them.  They stay in your ears very well, the only activities I couldn't recommend them for are swimming and boxing (and then only if you get hit).The sound is plenty loud, but these are not sound isolating headphones, so you will hear outside noise.The sound is OK.

They aren't noise cancellation specific headphones but the cushion wraps around my ears pretty well. It comes with extension cables if you need them but I find the length perfectly fine without using using the extension cables. It also comes with a airplane adapter (the 2 pins into 1 type) but I don't see myself using this on the plane. It is bulky for regular use but the mic is detachable. The headphones aren't heavy though and it comes with a nice travel bag as well. It also doesn't have a USB adapter (if that matters to anyone).","rating":5},{"comment":"I've been using these for a few weeks now since they came up for review on the Vine.I already have a pair of Sennheiser PC360's with the open ear design and really like them, for overall sound quality I prefer them.That said, when it comes to gaming with mic communications I would say that these Kingston Hyper X's are hands down the better choice.The problem with open ear sets is that they allow some sound to bleed through and can cause echo's and other noise issues depending on your environment and the volume level of your media.It's usually minimal but it's there.These closed ear cans wont have that issue. On top of that they cancel out any other distracting sounds and let you focus on your game\/work\/whatever you're doing.Right out of the box you can see that Kingston thought of everything, there is an extension cable for connecting the cans to your PC, which allows you to disconnect the headset quickly and take it somewhere else without climbing under your desk and disconnecting it.There is an 8th inch adapter for phones or other devices that use the single plug port, although I am unable to get them to work on my Galaxy S4 so far.They also have an optional controller that features a volume adjustment wheel and a mic on\/off switch. The Volume wheel on mine has an issue I've had on several cheap PC speaker volume wheels; when you turn it down far enough the right speaker cuts out. On this one you have to turn it down pretty far but it's still there. Not a big deal, definitely not a deal breaker but it's gunna upset some people at this price point. In contrast, the Sennheisers have a volume knob on the ear that is pretty freakin genius if you ask me.What surprises me though, is that despite all the extra connections there is no noticeable sound loss or noise anomalies. Everything still comes through nice and clear. The connections are solid.The mic for this headset is removable. it snaps into place really well and uses a standard 8th inch plug. My only gripe here is that the rubber cap that seals the hole when you are not using the mic comes completely off. It's really small so it will be really easy to lose it if you're not careful.The Mic quality is also surprisingly good. Voice comes through clean and has a pretty well rounded profile from bass to high end. If it wasn't a cardiod or maybe had a back plate it would help to eliminate outside noise but as it is it's still a nice little pc mic.The sound quality from the headphones is also really well rounded. I don't get the feeling that the cans favor low ends as much some headphones do. There is maybe a bit of favoritism in the bass range but it could also be that I'm just used to open-eared cans. I'm pretty happy and impressed with the quality of the audio I get out of these.Lastly they are comfortable! I have an average sized head and pretty average sized ears. These cans are more comfortable than my Senn's. Not only do they fit better but they also come with removable covers and optional cloth covers instead of the pleather ones they come out of the box with. I've left the pleather ones on though, I really like em. They're comfy, soft, seal the outside noise well and don't seem to be coming apart... yet. They do keep your ears a bit warm but I'm sitting close to an AC unit in my office so I don't mind at all.They were a bit tricky to adjust but they hold their fit really well. Once I had them adjusted, I haven't had to mess with them again.When you get up into this higher priced headsets it gets harder to decide which ones to get, big name brand, fancy features, etc.I feel like you can't really go wrong with this set. I've only had them for a month so I can't speak to their durability, but I also don't plan to take them off-roading or play any full contact sports with them. With the exception of the optional volume knob attachment, they feel like they'll last a while. The build of the actual headset feels solid and has good weight, not too heavy just solid.I'm definitely recommending these.PROS:Good Sound QualityGood Mic QualityComfortable Fit that holdsMic is detachableOptional Volume control knob attachmentOptional male to female mic\/stereo extension cableOptional Fabric Ear PadsSolid BuildComes with a mesh case for carrying headset and optional attachments.Blocks most outside noiseCONSVolume control knob feels cheap, may not work properly.Difficult to get adjustedAgain, I highly recommend this set if it is in your price point.The couple of minor complaints I have with these cans isn't enough to stop me from recommending them.Solid buy.","rating":4},{"comment":"This Kingston Technology HyperX Cloud Gaming Headset is light, weighing no more than 8 oz.  It is not surprising because this headset is made of lightweight aluminum and leather. The ear cups and headband are deeply padded. The headband is adjustable. This Kingston headset is comfortable to wear, even for extended period of hours.  A set of spare pads for the earcups comes with the purchase.A single cord about 4 feet long at the bottom of one of the two earcups ends in two 3.5 mm male plugs, the one coded red for the microphone output and the one coded green the audio input.  They can be plugged into an optional audio control box (included).  The overall length with the control box is about eight feet.  If this is not long enough, an extension cord (included) extends the reach to an additional seven feet.  A detachable microphone plugs into the earcup next to the cable.Connection to my Dell computer is easy.  There is an audio output jack and a microphone input jack at the front panel.  Supposedly, this headset is compatible with the PS4 console.  I don't have a PS4, so I have to leave it to other reviewers.  I figured out how to connect to the audio output of my PS3 and my Xbox 360 by use of a 3.5mm jack to dual-RCA jacks female\/female adapter (See Note).  But I haven't figure out how to connect the microphone to the consoles yet.  That doesn't bother me because I never feel the need to talk while playing video games. Curiously, there is no instructional manual in the box.  I couldn't find any online either.  A bag with a draw string and a Velcro secured front pocket (included) conveniently holds the headset, the spare parts, and the extension cords all in one place.When I get tired of playing games, I can plug the headset into my iPod for music with a 3.5 mm male plug to dual 3.5 mm female jacks splitter cable (included).  The sound is superb.  It is one of the best quality sound I heard over a headset.  There is plenty of bass.  I can clearly hear the drums in the sound tracks of Conan the Barbarian by Basil Pledouris. I think this Kingston HyperX Cloud headset is worth its price.Note: Check out the adapter atBIRUGEAR 6 inch Stereo Splitter Y-Cable - 3.5mm Jack to 2-RCA Jacks Audio Adapter (F\/F).","rating":5},{"comment":"These are very well reviewed by most of the big sites and I can see why. They are very light, sit well on the head, have no distortion, memory foam ear cups are a nice addition, very well built and come with a lot of nice accessories. For the dollar, hard to go wrong.There are some nitpicks that might be deal killers though. Despite large drivers I find these a bit light on the bass. This can be managed somewhat with EQ settings. The other issue we ran into with these is that the mic makes a person sound much higher pitched than they really are. My friends through it was so exaggerated that I must have been running a mic mod. They did comment on how clear the mic was but it is very poor at reproducing deeper voices.I like these and they are comfortable for long settings (I play for 8+ hours sometimes) but these are not as good as my previous Steel Series 9H. Those broke after a couple years use so I thought I would try something else. These aren't bad and sure seem durable but I like the sound out of my old ones more and the mic was certainly better at least as far as reproducing my voice accurately. My friend has the Genius Cavimanus which is almost as comfortable, cheaper, sounds better and has a better mic.","rating":4},{"comment":"After the old Steel Series Siberia headphones I was using on my production machine died in a office move (not their fault), I was looking for a replacement set which kept the good sound of the Siberia's but was more comfortable with longer use and did a better job of isolation from office noise.Well the HyperX Clouds meet that goal and then some.  The highly padded tops, large &#34;surround&#34; style cups and solid audio reproduction (note I am not an audiophile, so take that as &#34;sounds really good to someone listening to iTunes, YouTube, and digital files.&#34;)The packing was well thought out, and came with a second set of ear cups, airline adapter, separable microphone, and plug-in control box.  I didn't see any instructions in the box, but really didn't need them.  Everything was pretty intuitive.  The LED free design is refreshing and the graphics are nice and subdued (especially for gaming headphones).  The long, fabric braided cord was a nice touch- gives you some room to roam from the machine before you run out of leash.Overall I was very pleased with the HyperX Cloud headphones.  I liked the design, function and especially the comfort over long periods of use.  And their ability to help isolate you from external distractions while not looking like a rave party means you can use them at work too.  Highly Recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"Very light, very comfortable headset with decent sound.Mic is only so-so though.

The words \"muffled\" will never come anywhere near these headphones. The clarity is sharp and very distinct.I own many headphones, but I'm really impressed by how these headphones really FILL UP MY EAR; I feel claustrophobic now when I use other headphones like the Logitech UE6000 and Monster Beats.The aluminum build quality is great and feels solid - the Beats Headphones's cheap plastic construction (breaks easily, by the way), costing way more, is laughable in comparison.Although gaming headphones, usually optimized solely for gaming, may not be ideal for music listening, I can happily use these to listen to music. I hear new details I haven't heard before from the same music I've listened to hundreds of times. The clarity is just really fantastic. However, if you want major overpowering bass, then these aren't for you.I just watched some gameplay footage of Battlefield 4 on youtube with these headphones and it really made me feel like I was out in the battlefield; the detail, clarity, and directional surround sound is very impressive.Despite these headphones being large and made of aluminum, it is quite comfortable.One thing that was disappointing to me, though, was using it on my PS Vita and the game Killzone - the explosions sounds didn't blow me away compared to the amplified Beats.Packaging and presentation is also impressive. They didn't cut corners and you can tell they are proud of their own product.For the quality you get, the price is a major steal, considering there are many junk or inferior headphones that cost way more out there. I can definitely easily recommend these headphones without hesitation. You can't go wrong with them.","rating":5},{"comment":"Pros:Heavy Duty construction all around.SOUNDS GREAT W\/Music as well as Gaming.Everythings well made.These really are noise cancelling as you can totally immerse yourself in the game and hear NOTHING ELSE aside from whatever you are listening to on your headset.You can detach the mic and use this as a pair of studio headphones for your mobile\/mp3 device.Comes with a pair of velour earcups that you can swap out and use instead of the vinyl ones.Bought these to replace a pair of higher end Turtle Beach phones...and this headset makes them sound like crap in comparison.Cons: The volume knob on the unit is a little small and is the only piece on the headset that feels &#34;cheap&#34;There's no instructions in the box.","rating":5},{"comment":"***Using on PS3 and PS4, paired with Turtle Beach DSS.  Microphone was not used for online gaming, so it will not be mention any further.The following is my personal opinion (not an expert, just an avid gamer) on the Kingston Technology HyperX Cloud Gaming Headset based on using them for online and offline gaming, and my experience with other headsets I own or tried (Sennheiser PC360, HD 595, Turtle Beach PX5, Tritton 720, Astros A40, A50, Beyerdynamic mmx 300, PS Pulse Elite, among others).  There is very little to dislike about the package offered in this headset, since at around $99 one gets all the goodies other companies are no longer including with their headsets while keeping a high quality look and feel on every piece.  Be aware of what you want from the headset experience and this package may be just right for you.PROS+Extreme comfort, is impossible to describe.  I use glasses and never felt discomfort. Also pleasantly light weight+high quality packaging, easy to open and access the accessories+Plenty of accessories, for example there is a cable with a controller on it that serves as an extension and a separate extension cable without the controller.  This may offer all the accessories one may need for this or any other pair of headphones since is all in standard 3.5mm connections.  Carrying soft bag is a nice touch.+good quality construction, aluminum headband is really great (reminds me of Beyerdynamic, and it is so because this headset uses Beyerdynamic technology)+Good sound, excellent isolation from outside noise.  The closed designed is hit and miss, is a preference thing.  At their core this headsets sound really good+lots of bang for the buckCONS-at its widest, the headset opens just enough for my head.  I use L\/XL caps so I'm not small headed, but this is one of the few times a headset does not open wider than I need.Neutral\/Wishful thinking~as good as they sound, they are not fooling anyone these are not audiophile grade.  They are not advertised as audiophile so is not a problem.  But I like everything about them a lot, and the lack of an audiophile option is a downer (would be more expensive, that is why the Beyerdynamic MMX300 on a whole other league)Final ThoughtsWhat drove me towards this headset was the similarity in design with Beyerdynamic and the good reviews I have seen around the web.  I got to say that this product delivers on all fronts as an ENTRY level headset.  For the price they are hard to beat, all the accessories included and high quality makes this a winner.  For those looking for a more refined experience, don't stop here.  There are simply better options (more expensive by the way) out there.  Look at Sennheiser and Beyerdynamic for the top of the line, Astro for the package of mixamp and headset, Turtle Beach for the customization options etc.  However if one gets this headset and stops here, is ok as long as it fulfills the needs of the user.For comparisons sake let's take a look at the sound quality.  Sometime when Im using the A40 or HD595 I get lost in the sound, like I enjoy the sound as much as the game and that adds a layer of immersion to the gaming hobby.  I did not get that from the reviewed headset.  I got good sound, excellent comfort and great isolation, but once it was all about the game and sound it was as ordinary as listening from the home theater system in the sense that I never got \"lost\" in the game.  This is a personal preference, nothing expert about it.","rating":5},{"comment":"The one big downside to these headphones: they are stereo only. A lot of gaming speakers offer &#34;software simulated surround sound&#34; -- basically they register as 5.1 or 7.1 speakers and sounds meant to come &#34;from behind&#34; get tweaked a little bit to sound like they should if they were coming through your ear instead of beside your ear. While not as good as real 7.1, I do think it's a good addition for gaming headsets to have......and this doesn't have that.So it's just stereo.Still, it's hard to find fault with that when it does everything else so well. The stereo sound is flawless, the mic works great and best of all, the construction is solid.And that is a big plus.I've gone through a number of &#34;gaming headsets&#34; including high end Logitech and Creative Labs headsets that cost more than this and I dunno why they all do this but for whatever reason they love to use really awful quality materials. My last Creative headsets had the thin plastic break one day just putting them on my head. The Logitech earpads easily shred and they also use very flimsy plastic at important connection points. I guess they want them to break so that you will buy new ones occasionally? I dunno, but I'm tired of it and THESE headphones don't have that problem. They are solidly built with metal components that seem like they will last and have been durable so far. They're also just as comfortable as my Logitechs and the padding goes over my ears for a bit of sound isolation from the room.Note that these headsets are not USB so you'll need an actual sound source to plug them into -- I just use my motherboard's built in connections and it works fine there.","rating":5},{"comment":"Very  cool looking headset. It's comfortable and well made. Love the fact that you can detach the microphone if you just want a comfortable set of headphones that work great. My last headset had cords that drove me crazy so the no tangle cords are also a plus.","rating":5},{"comment":"I will first off state that I am not an audiophile. I am a bass head on the search for some really accurate headphones for decently competitive gaming. Currently I am still looking at the Q701. Not being able to pass up the HyperX Cloud because it was well under $100 I bought them. One wish that I had for these headsets is that they where open back, because the sound stage on the HyperX is a bit small. That is my only complaint for this headset. If you need a good pair of closed back headsets this should be really considered. The mids on the HyperX are excellent. Highs are really detailed, and there is bass but not overwhelming bass. When gaming you can really hear your environment from footsteps, gunfire, and explosions all come across clear where they should be. The mic is detachable and good. The HyperX is also very comfortable but on the large side. The packaging for this headset just blew me away. The care and thought that went into the packaging is jaw dropping one of the best I've seen. I believe that any product should have great packaging because it reflex's the care and thought that the company has put into their products. This is a great product and from the moment you open it you will not be disappointed unless you wanted an open back headset.","rating":4},{"comment":"Oh, and they sound pretty darn good too. But let's go into a little more detail. Also want to note that my test sources included a Galaxy Note 3, MSI GT70 notebook with internal Sound Blaster sound card, and my main gaming desktop with is running an X-Fi sound card via Astro mix-amp.OUT OF THE BOXThere's quite a bit of stuff in the box. You've got the headphones, several cables, extensions, and adapters. There's oddly not much in the way of documentation to explain how everything works or what it does. Although you can pretty much figure it out for yourself. The boxing itself is actually fairly high quality and does give the impression of a more expensive product. They were nice enough to allow you to select between the leather ear pads and velvety smooth cloth-type pads. Both are nice and comfy, just personal preference.Kingston also threw in a nifty cloth-like pouch for the headset. And understanding there are many cables, included a secondary outer pocket for the cables and adapters.DESIGN & COMFORTOf course once un-boxed, the first thing I noticed was the really nice and strong leather type smell. Something you'd expect from a far more expensive product. The headband and included ear pads have this super soft and nice smelling leather. I'm a fan. The rest either high quality sturdy rubber or aluminum. There's nothing cheap feeling about them. In fact, they feel nicer than just about everything other headset I have, including some $300 cans (i.e. Sennheiser PC360's). Combined with the red stitching on the headband and other accents, they look pretty darn cool.In addition to smelling and looking nice, they are quite comfortable. With all of this leather, how could it not? One negative however, is the inner felt lining to the interchangeable ear pads. Because it's rather shallow, my ears made contact when I put them on. It's soft, but I did find it a little annoying after extended use. Most over-the-ear headphones have a bit more clearance.CABLES, ADAPTERS, MICAs noted there are several adapters and cables. The main cable with analog mic\/headphone jack is permanently attached to the headset is fairly short for use with a notebook, for example. It's right about 4ft, or 48\". Then there are short extension cables if needed. You've also got adapters for different type of analog use, such as your phone with 3 bands (to use sound & mic with a single cable) and even separate left\/right 3.5mm connection, which is rather uncommon.In addition to being able to swap out the ear pads, you can also remove the microphone. It's part of a bendy and easy-to-adjust boom that makes it easy to position right where you want it. The other party had no problem hearing me and said I sounded nice and clear via Skype. Although they did admit I sounded a little clearer with my previous headset, which happened to be the much more expensive PC360's.CONTROL POD & PHONE USEThere is also a control pod which adds a bit of cable length (43\"). This allows you to adjust volume and mute. Unfortunately without the pod attached, there is no way to do this via the headset or in-line controls. This is a bit clumsy to use on a regular basis, but that's all you get. There is a button on the pod that is only used with a phone. With a non-phone device, it just makes a loud popping noise.So if you use the included 3-ring 3.5mm adapter to connect it to your phone, and you decide to include the control pod in this setup (it's optional, of course), you can press this large square multi-functional button. If you're playing music it'll stop\/pause. If a call comes in, you can also use it to answer and hang-up. At least that's what it does with my Android Galaxy Note 3 phone. Sorry, no forward\/back button.Unfortunately using the control pod on-the-go means a combined length of around 7 1\/2 feet! Not exactly portable unless you roll it up and find a place to put it.SOUND QUALITYThis is where the large 53mm drivers really shine. These headphones easily rival headphones costing 2-3 times as much. They have a very rich sound with deep bass, solid mid-range, and crisp high's. The bass is what you'll really notice. With every audio source I threw at it, the deep full range was very welcome. I watched some movies, played some games with Skype in the background, and threw in some various types of music for good measure.Everything sounded excellent. And thanks to the very comfortable ear pads, my ears and head never got uncomfortable. Which is rather surprising since these are a closed design. In other words, they tend to block most outside noises. This design also tends to limit ventilation, which can get annoying. Although after a long 2 hour gaming session, I did find that I needed a break sooner than my open-air headphones.PROS:+ Excellent sound quality for the price+ Plenty of bass when there should be+ Top-end build quality and materials+ Every adapter you'll ever need+ Removable microphone+ Long & Short cable options+ Works with your phone (using optional adapter)+ Included pouch+ Smells awesomeCONS:+ Closed design can still cause extended listening fatigue+ Ear makes contact with inner felt lining+ Must use control pod with long cable to mute or adjust volume+ Optional control pod's added cable length can be cumbersomeCONCLUSION:If you're looking for a good set of closed gaming headphones with a mic and you're budget happens to be around a hundred bucks, look no further. While there are a few questionable feature choices, nothing is perfect. Sure, you can find something better, but not likely at this price point. And in either case, they certainly won't smell as good. :)","rating":5},{"comment":"Two disclaimers up front. First, I received these for free as part of the Vines Review program.  Secondly, I'm not to gaming and this is my first set of Gaming headphones.I've had several different pairs of headphones - Beats Pro, every Bose Headset they make, a $50.00 set of Sony's and that's been my comparison point. Having gotten into gaming recently, this was my first set that had a  mic on it that I wear for long periods of time.Comfort wise:  They're comparatively big but they're also light.  Even though they're light though, they feel quite sturdy and well made (much more than say any of the Beats I have).  They fit really well and after a few minutes you almost forget you have them on.  B\/c they're light they put virtually no pressure on your ears or head and I'm at a loss for words to describe the fit other than 'really comfortable.&#34;  B\/c they fit firmly as well, they block external noise really well - so much so I probably keep them on for hours at a time.  They might not technically be 'noise canceling' like another headset I have, but they do the job much better anyway.  Suffice to say they are the most comfortable headset I've used.As I mentioned earlier, they're also really sturdy.  While being unobtrusive, they fit very firmly and stay in place even if you move around a lot.  Again I don't have the right word for it, but they just feel really well built.  I've had the pads come out of my beats more times than I can count. I've cracked several Bose headsets I've had shortly after buying them or stuffing them in a suitcase.  I've actually dropped these twice so far and there's no indication at all that I dropped them.And then there's the most important thing - the audio.  The mic does a great job at canceling out ambient and background noise - when I've used them for presentations I've noticed a marked difference in the voice b\/c they keep the background noise out.  They sound every bit as good as any of other other headsets I've mentioned and if there's any difference in sound quality, I can't detect it.My only gripe with them is that I've paid 2-3 times as much for a few different headsets and after having these for a week, I feel like a chump for not having bought these first.  Looking at the other reviews, I noticed all Five Stars. I'm speculating here, but the more people that review these, the more 5 star reviews you'll see. These things are just awesome, and for the price, don't waste your time with anything else.","rating":5},{"comment":"I must admit that when I received this backpack I felt disappointed by how flimsy it is. The material does not feel as high quality as I want in a backpack that is going to be used to carry my laptop or tablet around in. The size of the backpack is too small to carry several text books in so it might be of some use for elementary or junior high students, but because of the lack of space I feel that it's too small for older students.","rating":2},{"comment":"This back pack design is great on sturdiness and well-sewn seams, looks and has everything you'd want in a backpack - except for size. While the width is good, I think the depth is a bit slim. If I was a kid needing a standard amount of room for books, notebooks, laptop and more, this would get pretty tight fairly quick. If you are wanting a backpack that holds your laptop, that might be pushing it too, because mine does not fit inside the pack since the top corners cut in too quickly for the width of my laptop. I like the color and the angle slant on the blue\/black breakdown and the padded straps, belts, zippers and toggles are nice, very sturdy. This might do for someone who has one class or just wants to carry a lighter backpack.  I plan on using it to carry books and supplies to and from another house location, so it's going to work nicely for me, but doubt it would be enough for someone taking a full day of school.","rating":3},{"comment":"I absolutely love this Five Star backpack.  It is made of the highest quality polyester and the stitching and zippers are strongly reinforced.  I don't see this tearing or falling apart no matter how much use it gets.  What I also love is it has many pockets for storage while managing to not be as huge and cumbersome as some backpacks are.  There is a laptop sleeve, an angular sleeve for small items and two very large main compartments.  The straps on the back are very comfortably padded and easy to adjust.I carry this bag with me everywhere I go.  And I cannot stress how great it is due to its size.  Whether using all pouches or just a few and you need a bag to carry to hold small things this backpack will do it all.  And the mesh water bottle holder is very efficient and also very well made.  Some backpacks are cheap and even if attractive you can tell seams will tear and it won't last for long.  I don't worry about that here at all.  And the colors of it with the blue and black are very attractive.  Highly recommend this Five Star backpack.  It is very well made, has all the compartments you could need and will sturdily handle all your stuff whether a lot or a little.","rating":5},{"comment":"With my husband's job, he carries a backpack to work with him. I thought he might benefit from this one, since it has a sleeve for his laptop.Really, it was too lightweight to be useful for such heavy use. It's a perfectly fine backpack for light use. We've decided to use it for one of our boys &#34;overnight at Nana's house&#34; bag, and it works great for that purpose!","rating":3},{"comment":"Decent and inexpensive backpack.  It's called angle zip because, as you can see, it has an angled zipper across the main, front  compartment, but there's also the standard &#34;u-shaped&#34; zipper that opens up the rest of the backpack.On the left side of the backpack is a mesh pocket for a water bottle or whatever.  The main compartment is surprisingly roomy for a small backpack, and there's a 2nd partitioned section in that main compartment.  The smaller front compartment also unzips and has an open storage area and 2 small partitioned compartments in it.Pretty nice little backpack for not a lot of money.  4 stars.","rating":4},{"comment":"How in the world can you one give an article a 5 star and then wish NOT to use it.  Simple.  I'll explain in a while.First, let's look at this Five Star Backpack.  It is light weight but it is well stitched and sturdy.  Attempts to pull the seams apart did not work.  I did not use major power, such as a towing hitch, but did use ordinary strength.  Its 7 internal sections can hold lots of stuff, depending on what stuff goes in.  The front pocket can be used for a water bottle or other container or even a large cell phone such as a Note II with room to spare.  Its shoulder straps are well padded and will make it use easier.  Each of the four zippers has a tag that makes opening and closing easier.  The handle on the back could be better and I resolved my issue by simply wrapping a washcloth around the handle and securing it in place with 2 hook and loop bands.A friend and I were talking and reviewing some computer related matters when he eyed the backpack and modestly said, 'Why in the world would an old man like you get a backpack?'  Unlike many, he had the gumption to say what was on his mind and I said that when he gets old he will wish for one and if I get another one I will will him this one.  &#34;But, a backpack, for an old man?  Why?&#34;  Simple.  Each of us will have another reason to visit a hospital or worst an emergency room and when that time comes, we do not want to be running around the house looking for this and that before that ambulance arrives or we get in the car.  We made a list of items to have on hand and put one each for each of us for that just in case trip.  For example, my Cardio guy has told me to look forward to another valve replacement next year, maybe (make that a big maybe).  In this case office hours begin at 6 a.m. and the staff was waiting at the elevator when we exited.  No waiting on this trip.  &#34;We've been waiting and it is time to go!&#34;  Wham, Bam and in 14 hours it was closure time, except they had to go back in and resew the job.So, backpacks are not necessarily for a student or a youngster to carry video games and media players.  They can have other valuable reasons for use.  This one will serve our needs just fine.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a sturdy backpack.  It is a simple design with room for a tablet or laptop.  There is nothing special about it.  But it does the job.  It is lightweight and well made.","rating":4},{"comment":"This bag is a bit smaller than I expected. It will my laptop, but it is not very spacious. There is very minimal padding and straps do not wrap around the body at all. It does not appear to be constructed for electronic devices. It is not intended for hiking either, but appears to be a decent pack for school supplies, notebooks, or a change of clothes. The main compartment has an inner pocket, but it is wide open on top and does not zip or velcro closed.","rating":3},{"comment":"I am an adult who works with a laptop, and needs a way to transport it to various locations.  I'm hard on laptop backpacks, and find a good one lasts me about a year.  I'm about due for a new backpack, so I thought I would give the Five Star angle zip + backpack a try.The Five Star angle zip + backpack, made in China, is a simple multi-compartment polyester backpack designed to hold a laptop as well as other necessities.  Compartments include the front thin pocket with an angle zip and two larger compartments accessed from the top.  Pockets include a mesh water bottle pocket on one side, assorted internal organizational pockets in the front main compartment, and a large pocket for a laptop in the rear main compartment.The Five Star angle zip + backpack is so basic, it fails to be a worthy replacement for my current Targus laptop backpack.  The padding between the back and the laptop is thin and the laptop pocket is flimsy, the protective qualities of this backpack are minimal.  Plus there is no weight distribution system, those who weigh down a backpack can expect soreness in the shoulders and back.If you're looking for a backpack for your child, the may do the trick.  Otherwise, consider better quality alternatives like theTargus laptop backpacks with weight distribution management instead.PROS:It is a backpackCONS:Flimsy and cheapNo weight distribution","rating":1},{"comment":"The Five Star backpack is smaller than I expected it to be. It really seems to be a backpack for elementary to middle-schoolers.  While it's not L.L. Bean quality, it's plenty solid enough to get through a school year or two, maybe even three.  Plain, nothing special, but also no problems with basic functionality.","rating":4},{"comment":"The most distinctive feature of this backpack is the angle zipper back, which gives it a bit of style and an extra-large entrance to the back pocket. However, half the pocket is above the zipper so it's not usable except for a large item (like a notebook) that you can maneuver to fit under the top section. Inside is one roomy area and a smaller mesh pocket for organizing smaller items.There's also one mesh pocket (not two, as in the description) on the side for a water bottle.The exterior dimensions are approximately 14x10x4 inches which is on the small side. It would not be useful for a high school backpack meant to carry several textbooks, though it could be useful for a younger student to carry lunch and a couple of notebooks. It's extremely compact and light weight--the box from 'Amazon was so small and light I wondered if there was anything inside. This would make it a good choice if you are traveling and want to put something in your luggage for day hikes.Construction appears to be fine, good solid zippers and no defects in the workmanship.","rating":3},{"comment":"Being lightweight just as the name implies, this backpack would be good for kids in the early grades of school that just need something that won't weigh them down while waiting for the school bus.I could see it working pretty good for books and composition books and even a Kindle or other computer tablet.It's not designed to be a heavy protection pack so make sure your tablet device has a good case if your kid takes one to school.I have some backpacks where you can put your iphone or ipod in a specially designed spot near the top of the backpack and connect them to specially designed input\/output opening so you don't have to take them out of the backpack.  Just hook your ear buds or headphone into your backpack's connection and you are connected to your iphone or ipad without having to take them out of the backpack.This backpack doesn't have that advanced feature, but that's OK.  It's designed to be a less expensive product so I'm just letting you know what's out there if you want more than the basics.I could see the backpack being used to tote some hero\/sub sandwiches that you bought on the way to a lake or state park where you  need to hike a little ways from your car to get away from the crowd.  Throw in a couple of bottles of wine and it would make an easy way to carry your little picnic getaway.It would also be easy to use on a vacation where you buy souveigner shirts and want a way to carry them without having to have 4 or 5 different bags in your hand.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a nice, lightweight, seemingly durable backpack - and the selling point is definitely that the main zipper goes all the way to the bottom, making it easier to access your stuff while the backpack is hanging on a hook.  That is a nice feature to have if you hang backpacks on hooks either on lockers or at home, like we do.  If you are careful you can even get stuff out of the pack with one hand, if necessary.When this first arrived, I thought it looked too small, but when we tried it out, it held everything we needed with space to spare.  It holds more than we realized at first.  The padded shoulder straps are comfortable, and the laptop sleeve is great for laptop or tablet.  We also like the water bottle holder because our family carries water bottles all the time.  The two front pockets are good for smaller things or things you need quick access too, like cell phones.The colors and design is nice too, it's not something that will go out of style in a few years.  This backpack should serve young ones and families well for a few years.  I would recommend it.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a well made backpack, I like the padded back panel that rests against your back and makes this more comfortable to use.  I like that there is a well padded sleeve to protect your laptop or tablet.  I like the fact that you can unzip this and easily see and reach into the bottom of the bag.  The straps are well padded and easy to adjust and the main compartment is ample.I didn't like that the small compartment has a zipper that zips on the side, I think it gives the potential for items to slip out; I would have preferred the zipper closure to close at the top of the bag.I'm not sure what the sidekick is.  I received a backpack and that was all, so I can't say anything about the sidekick.This seems like a really nice, well made back pack.","rating":4},{"comment":"This backpack has room for everything.  There are so many pockets, some specifically designed with an intended use in mind, so anyone could use this product.  Calling this your &#34;sidekick&#34; is so appropriate.It a mostly blue, with black accents.  I thought the product picture did not allow you to see this, so I thought I would let you know.  The straps are padded for comfort and allow for longer wear.  There are so many pockets!  I cans tore my full laptop, Kindle, cellphone, books, notebooks and lunch in separate compartments. There is an insulated pocket perfect for lunches, water bottles or even your laptop.  The compartments make this functional for school, work, hiking and general storage.I really love this product.  It is so comfortable and convenient.  If you are looking for a backpack I highly recommend getting this Five Star Sidekick.","rating":5},{"comment":"There are many brands of backpacks and this is one of the better ones I have seen.Its got the main compartment with a zipper that opens all the way to the bottom to give easier access to your things.Inside is a sleeve for a laptop and there is a mesh side pocket for your water bottle.There is a small side pocket also to store other things.Its sewn together quite well and you shouldn't have any issues with it coming apart.I like the color of it also.The blue and black go together well.The straps to carry it on your back are nicely padded to.I really like this and your kids should be happy with it also.","rating":5},{"comment":"My wife gets our high schooler super heavy duty backpacks and this won't do for her. She carries about 4 huge textbooks, her lunch, and a medium sized laptop and power supply. But, this isn't a light weight cheapy either. We (my wife and I) would both place this as the sort of backpack for a middle schooler and the type of books and stuff to carry then. Stitching is pretty solid, zippers are nice and operate cleanly, and the standard carrying handle at the top is excellent. The bottle carrying mesh on the side is very useful (albeit typical). The layout of compartments is pretty cool with the larger one having a padded slot for a medium to small laptop or tablet. If you've got a Chevy Suburban sized laptop, this probably won't do for you.So, 5 out of 5 stars for being what it is, an excellent backpack that will carry more than popcorn and less than bricks (if you know what I mean).UPDATE 29 MAY 2014: After wearing this for a while (every day since I received it) I have to compliment the overall padding of the shoulder straps and back. This is a very comfortable backpack to wear around. I have to note I am a two shoulder strap guy and not slogging around with this over one shoulder, if that makes a difference.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is both an attractive and very functional bag with a padded section to carry your laptop or ipad\/tablet.  While the bag is hanging up, which mine often is on a door hook in my office, the main compartment allows the bag to be opened fully. There is a typical water bottle pocket, a storage pouch for your small stuff and a good sized main compartment.  Five Star is a trusted quality brand and I would recommend this product for students or others, all ages.","rating":4},{"comment":"Comfortable, adjustable straps let you wear this backpack for a easy hike or carrying books around campus.  It has enough compartments to keep what you need within easy reach.  The only drawback is the durability.  The fabric feels thin so I&#8217;m not sure how well this would hold up to serious hiking for days or any type of rugged environment.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a nice all-around backpack for kids, but is probably fine for many adults as well. The material looks fairly rugged for general use, but it's probably not quite hiker's quality, but that's not what it's marketed for anyway.  It's very voluminous and you can really cram a ton of stuff in it.  The laptop section is a nice touch and fits your standard 15&#34; laptops or smaller.  There are a bunch of pockets within the backpack where you could store phones, pencil cases, notepads, etc.Note that while this backpack is geared towards kids, it's definitely on the large size, so for those under 8 or so, it may be a bit on the large side.  Still (small) my 8-year-old has been using it daily the last few weeks and really likes it and doesn't mind the size at all - actually likes being able to fit more things in it.  Likewise because it is on the large size, I can wear this backpack very comfortably myself, so it's probably a good bag for a fairly large age range.","rating":4},{"comment":"This bag works great for a variety of applications.  Despite having a low number of zippers, there is a multitude of pouches within the bag to store a large number of things, including tablets.  I used this bag on a recent trip to Vegas and it easily held my Kindle Fire, two Vitas (in their own cases), and about 2 days worth of clothes with some room to spare.  The straps fit comfortably, even for me and I'm a pretty big guy.  The material seems quite durable.  My only minor deduction is the side pocket that appears to be made for holding a water bottle; it seems to be a common problem, but I just wish (like others) that it was about 2 inches deeper.  If it had been, it would've been perfect.Otherwise, it's a great bag for school or for someone looking to pack something light and fun on the go.  Recommended!","rating":4},{"comment":"The backpack is probably fine for someone in middle school that doesn't carry many books.Also, that takes good care of it.The material is very thin, much thinner than comparable jansports backpacks. So I don't think it will last very long. We'll see.It is also a little small, hence my mention of not too many books, both because they might not fit, or if they do, they are likely to tear the backpack.That said, the backpack by itself is very light, which is nice - not much extra weight from it. The 2 tone colors are nice, and it will do fine for smaller kids.I'd say it's for primary\/middle school aged children.","rating":3},{"comment":"The workmanship and quality show in the manufacturing of this bag.  Nice, solid zippers and pockets.  Lots of room for day hikes, or carrying a laptop, etc.  I like the mesh back liner that helps keep my back cool.  Very nice and recommended.","rating":4},{"comment":"I use this backpack for airplane trips.  It's more versatile than my professional laptop computer bag (which I pack in my suitcase).  It can fit A LOT of stuff into its multiple compartments.  Its padding adequately protects the computer.  It's comfortable to carry on my bag - even when it's weighted down with books, a computer, and my other electronics.","rating":5},{"comment":"This Five Star Sidekick and Backpack is very well made--strong and resilient with a lot of side pockets and little nooks for storing things. Both my girls immediately tried to claim it once I opened the package; it's attractive enough for older kids not to be embarrassed by, and it looks like it's going to stand the test of time. So far, so good!","rating":4},{"comment":"My first impression of this was how lightweight it is.  By itself it weighs almost nothing, yet the fabric and seams appear to be tough and durable.  On examination, the pockets are numerous and well thought out.  The front pocket contains pen-keepers and spots for other items a student might need to carry to school.  There are side pockets and a small pocket that is surprisingly deep, for items like keys, ear-buds etc.  The straps are well-padded and comfortable.All in all, this is a really well-designed pack.  Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to really put it through its paces yet.  I had ordered it a week or so before leaving on a 3-week international trip and thought I would use it for my carry on luggage, in order to thoroughly test it, however it didn't arrive in time for that.  In a few weeks my son will leave on a trip to Europe so I've passed it on to him to use for HIS carry-on, and will be able to update my review with his experience of it, after he returns.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a good backpack, suitable for schoolkids (doesn't look &#34;dorky&#34; to use a kid-phrase) but also fine for adults, whether carrying your lunch and laptop to work, or lugging bottles of water and other items around Disneyworld....Big pockets and plenty of space. The material is lightweight, but seems like it would be durable enough. Not quite as sturdy as my Wenger laptop bag, but certainly good enough to serve as a backup or for any other purpose. Well made and a good backpack.","rating":4},{"comment":"This backpack is great but a little different than what I'm used to. It seems to be well made and will hopefully last a while. My 15&#34; laptop fits in the laptop sleeve inside great. There seems to be enough padding to protect it. I also really like the smart phone pocket in the front middle. I have perfect easy access to it without having to rummage around larger pockets. I know it won't get scratched since it fits in there perfectly.The shoulder straps are the part that are a little different and I'm not sure I like them. They actually go over the zipper enclosure of the largest pocket of the backpack. This means that in order to open the backpack and remove items, I have to somewhat flip the straps and move them out of the way. I'll see if the system grows on me, but I'm not sure it will.","rating":4},{"comment":"For many years, I carried a sturdy laptop bag with all my IT devices in it. It has served me quite well but I had concerns about back problems with it being just an over the shoulder bag with all the weight on one size. I wanted to try a backup for this needs and I have to say, the Five Start Ergo Backpack earns its five stars. :)I was initially afraid of not having as much storage but no worries at all. You have a small zipper pouch on the front and inside, it is divided so you can put smaller stuff on the pouch. Then, there is a much smaller zipper compartment above that and it is perfect for jump drives, a stylus and other smaller devices or connectors. VERY NICE. The main pouch contains a mildly padded area for your main device (in my case, Surface Pro 3) and it fits perfect. It also contains a Velcro strap to keep it a little more secure. The main pouch is also very deep so perfect for power cords, game controllers or as second laptop\/tablet.The backpack is also quite comfortable and easy to put on and remove. High marks for the nice padding on the straps.I absolutely love this backpack.","rating":5},{"comment":"This bag is of decent quality and has a lot of great storage, pockets, etc. Quality-wise, it seems mid-range, but that's perfect for my needs. I wear it when I bike to the gym and it holds my shorts, shoes and towel with ease. It's comfortable to wear and has the necessary space to carry everything I need.","rating":4},{"comment":"At first glance, the Five Star (no, calling it Five Star isn't enough to make it a five-star product. Nice try! ;) Sidekick Backpack looks flimsy. That's not quite true, as a closer look will tell you. The seams are well-sewn and things seem well-put-together in general. I am worried that with use, some of the edges will start to fray, but that has not happened yet.There's ample room for your things, unless you're an outlier. For the everyday laptop user, you won't find too much to complain about in terms of space. There's a side pocket for bottles and the front pouch is roomy. I'm not too happy with the design of the handle, however. Seems like a lot of work to answer a question no one was asking. The blue straps pass over the main section of the bag so that the points of pressure, carrying the bag is much higher and back than a conventional strap. It makes it awkward to hold and maneuver the bag. The padded section for carrying a laptop is a little skimpy and the material covering the bag seems cheap.An adequate 3 stars.*Update: I have now used the backpack a few more times and I am unhappy with its usability, starting with its strap design, which made little sense in the first place, but now I've found actually impedes use. Storage both in the main compartment and in the front pouch is sloppy and that feeling of cheap manufacturing, it's spot on. Down to one star.","rating":1},{"comment":"This unique design is not an improvement to the classic backpack. You place items inside the main pouch (under the wide padded arms) and flip the arms over the zipped-up pack. Yes, it's good that it looks secure, but what about the traditional small compartment that's still exposed? An even smaller zipper pocket is above that (it's just the right size for popular smart phones).However, my main concern is that the design poorly distributes weight for medium-heavy and heavy loads.  There's a ribboned loop on the front of each arm strap for one to pull down in order to help relieve the weight. They can only do so much and then you're stuck with constantly puling at your pack. My teen son especially dislikes the fit\/ feel.There's only padding for the wearer's back and arms. There's a laptop compartment that we can't use anymore because padding (on the bottom &#34;floor&#34; of pack) doesn't exist=no protection when setting bag down. I could also feel my lightweight (15 inch) laptop's bottom keep hitting the small of my back (below the back padding) when walking.The overall look and feel of this backpack is cheap and the design makes it a burden to wear for any good length of time when carrying (a weighed) 5 lbs. or more. Unfortunately, this weight is nothing close to what most students have to cary these days...I give it an extra star for the smart phone pocket and bottle holder.","rating":2},{"comment":"I love this adult size backpack!

There&#8217;s also a mesh pocket on the side for a water bottle.Unfortunately, that&#8217;s it for storage for the Ergo Sidekick. Other backpacks I have owned in the past have multiple pockets and storage space, which I find useful as it allows me to isolate and find what I need quickly.The backpack, which appears to be made from nylon, is thin and the straps have a minimum amount of padding. I&#8217;m not sure how well this backpack will hold up when packed with heavy textbooks, or even a heavy laptop.  Based on the thinness of the fabric, it may be a better backpack for lighter items and clothing.From a comfort perspective, the backpack is very comfortable and fits nicely on my shoulders. My main concerns, however, are that the fabric may not hold up long term, and the fact that the Ergo Sidekick does not have a lot of individual storage space or pockets.","rating":3},{"comment":"While this Five Star backpack definitely cannot compete with the Thule backpack I have, it also doesn't cost anywhere near what the Thule cost.  It's a very pretty backpack, too, with a nicely padded back to protect a laptop.  My 13\" Toshiba laptop fits perfectly in the laptop pocket. There are no additional pockets on the inside of the backpack, but the usual school pockets in the front zip pouch; as well as a small zip pocket under the Five Star logo in front, perfect for a cell phone or iPod.

This backpack is designed so that you can transport a laptop if you would like. Currently, I don&#8217;t have a laptop computer. However, I have used this backpack to carry around a portable DVD player and it did a good job at protecting it. The shoulders feel soft and provide a great deal of comfort even when transporting a portable DVD player, some DVDs, several books, notebooks, pens, a banana, a sandwich, and a water bottle. I can&#8217;t vouch for the long term durability of the backpack as I&#8217;ve only had it a couple of weeks. However, it seems to be made from relatively durable materials and has held up well during the excursions I have used it so far. I also really like the colors: the backpack is mostly black, but is highlighted by a bright color of blue on the sides and down the middle. Overall, so far, I have found FIVE STAR ERGO SIDEKICK BACKPACK to be a lightweight, but durable backpack that has met my immediate needs.","rating":5},{"comment":"I don't like this backpack.

I use backpacks all the time, and grab one on my way out the door to hold whatever I'm going to need for the day.  This one, though, is definitely not going to be the first one I grab, because it just looks gaudy and cheap.  Also, it has a really strange pocket in the front, just behind the big pocket on the bottom.  It's a small zipper opening, but yet the pocket goes really deep.  I think only a small child would be able to reach all the way down to the bottom of that pocket, and for me, it's useless.  I also think it's hard to open the main compartment with the back straps sewn the way they are.  Every time I try to get in it, the straps are in my way .If you are a fan of Eastpak or Jansport, you will be disappointed in this pack.  It's just not up to the quality of those other brands.  And plus, they have a very long or lifetime guarantee, so if anything ever does break, you just mail it in and they either fix it free or send you a new one.  I've used those guarantees many times and it works great.  With this one, *when* it breaks (notice I didn't say if), you'll have no options other than trashing it and getting a new one.","rating":2},{"comment":"Roomy backpack with nice comfortable straps. The padding is a bit thin on the inside bottom, so I worry a bit about my laptop when kept there. The only other thing that feels a bit awkward is the straps coming over the top of the bag.  This makes the bag more comfortable, but it makes it a little bit more complicated to zip everything up and go.For the price this is a great deal, we'll have to see how long the padding takes to compress.","rating":4},{"comment":"The backpack is approximately 19 inches tall by 13 inches wide, is lightweight yet well padded, and attractive.  Several family members of varying sizes and I were able to adjust the backpack so that it fit comfortably.  It has 3 outside zippered pouches:The first one is about half the height of the backpack (about a foot wide by 8 inches tall), and contains a couple of small stitched compartments that would hold an upright pen, a zippered compartment that would hold keys and change, and a 9 inch wide by 6 inch tall pocket open at the top.The second zippered pouch on the outside is about 4 inches wide by 8 inches deep.  I'm not what you'd put in this one, maybe a drink or your cell phone.Finally there is the zipper that runs the from the base of one side of the backpack to the base on the other side, going over the top.  Inside is a large pocket 12 inches wide by 12 inches tall, with elastic at the top.  There is a strap from the very top of the backpack that secures this inside pouch with via a patch of Velcro on the strap and pocket.  You could secure a laptop or tablet inside this pocket.There is a handle attached to the top of the two backstraps, which is handy for picking it up.  There is also a loop on the upper back for hanging the backpack up.One \"feature\" I don't understand is that the backstraps are attached in front of the largest zippered pouch.  In my opinion, this makes it difficult to easily open the rear zippered compartment enough to extract large objects (books, laptop, etc.)  In other backpacks I've owned, the straps are secured behind all of the zippered pouches.  All I can think of is that it might secure the contents more tightly to you in the event you're jogging or biking.Overall, this is a lightweight, sturdy, attractive backpack.  Four stars.","rating":4},{"comment":"Great Tablet. Nice size 10.1 in, nice weight. easy to get Samsung APPs for almost anything. Got Kindle store very easy. Battery life is long - have run it for over 5 hours, with no problem. Can add sandisk micro memory. Charges from the wall plug, in about 2 to 3 hours - seems fast charge. Screen is bright brilliant colors. Settings give great flexibility in many things, easy font size, scren time out, time zone, etc. Very good buy.","rating":5},{"comment":"I owned an 8-inch tablet before, not a Galaxy. It was three years old. The memory configuration was the pits, it was no longer supported and couldn't be upgrade past 4.0 (and NO it could not be rooted). I love the larger screen of the Tab 4 and purchased a folder with a bluetooth keyboard when I bought the Galaxy Tab 4. Three months ago I purchased a new laptop. Now that I have the Galaxy Tab 4 my wife is the proud owner of that new laptop. The Galaxy Tab 4 has every bit as good sound as the laptop (yes the laptop was from a well know company). The screen may not be the highest resolution on the market, but I'm pleased with it. I think this tablet is as good (for my purposes) as my son's iPad. If you are wondering, I watch video iTunes-Podcasts on my Galaxy Tab 4. You only need to install Podcast Addict. YES, I love my Galaxy Tab 4! Many years ago I started out with a Sony Clie PDA, than moved to the Palm PDA and to various cell phone type PDAs. My experience with tablet like devices is fairly extensive, this is the third tablet I have owned, not counting the PDAs. The Galaxy Tab 4 is the best yet.","rating":5},{"comment":"Got our Galaxy 10.1 and were very anxious to get started with it. Everything went fine until we tried to link up devices with bluetooth. We like it BUT it turns out that some of these tablets have problems with Bluetooth and we must have gotten one of them. Other than that so far it has been good. I need to contact Amazon and find out what can be done about the Bluetooth issue.Note: I did do some research on this and found that Samsung does not have a fix and they really do not seem to know what to do about it. So if you want to purchase one make sure it will scan and detect bluetooth devices before you purchase it.","rating":3},{"comment":"I'm not a huge fan of Android, but this is a fun tablet! I own both Surface and iPad tablets, but i do pick this one up a lot. Good performance, nice screen, best tablet with Android I have seen. The camera is OK, but the tablet is peppy and responsive, and the display is very good. Very good battery life, too. If you are into the Google\/Android ecosystem, you can't go wrong with this table.","rating":4},{"comment":"This product is an iPad crusher. I have several iPads, iPhones, iPods and Mac computers. I love Apple products but this Samsung Tab 4 is better, faster, easier to use and comes with a host of standard features that Apple does not even have available such as opening most attachments, file system connectivity and what I love is the enhanced print features. Finally, there's the price. At half the price there is no question that this is the tablet to buy.","rating":5},{"comment":"I love this Tablet. Processor is very fast. Couldn't ask for a better Tablet. Thank youin the future ill buy another one :))","rating":5},{"comment":"I purchased my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 from BigBox (cheaper price than Amazon at time of purchase). I LOVE the tablet. Beautiful picture, best keyboard (allowing SWYPE), easily add storage, responds quickly, simple to use. HOWEVER, this table will not allow user to view Amazon video on this device. Contacted Amazon. Received note that Amazon video currently does not stream over Android. So, sadly, I am returning to store. If you have no need to stream Amazon video, then this issue will, of course, not affect you. Good Luck.","rating":3},{"comment":"Amazing tablet! I've never been a fan of apple as I like the freedom android offers. This tablet offers all I need and more. Everyday I discover something else I like about it.I use this for everything from browsing the internet, playing games, watching movies, listening to music and doing school work.I haven't had any incompatibility w\/ apps. Never had any problem w\/ blue tooth.Only issue is with Android 4.4 you can't write to the external sd. You can fix this by rooting your tablet and downloading the \"sd fix\" app. I found that issue to be quite frustrating but it was an easy fix because this tablet unlike some others (and some phones) is very easy to root.I recommend buying the Belkin keyboard case. That is an absolutely awesome addition to this tablet.","rating":5},{"comment":"Checked prices and as always Amazon comes in with the best prices. I love this new toy! I was going to go check out the pro but the clarity of this is great. So I saved myself some money and am very pleased with this.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have been happy with this item from day one.  I got it to stream Youtube and do emails.  It works great for them both.  I do not experience much buffering.  I say much because I stream mostly on Wifi and some connections are weak.  The color the sound are crisp and clean. Pictures are awesome.  It automatically syncs contacts, etc.  And the price was right.  You will be more than satisfied with this purchase.","rating":5},{"comment":"I love this product. It is way better than many other tablets available in the market. Its performance is amazing and so easy to use. It also support almost all file systems. So there is no music or video file this awesome device cannot open. Great Audio and video quality too. The sensitive touch screen works pretty faster too. Anyway to protect that extra sensitive screen I use useiCloth Touchscreen Cleaning Wipes (iC3x50) instantly clean iPad, iPhone, tablet, smartphone, laptop, Kindle, e-Reader (50 Tri-pak wipes).It works pretty good. Anyway if you have a better product, just mention it here.","rating":5},{"comment":"This tablet is the best invention so far its very light weight  you could take it any where.I love it its better than my laptop.I would recommend it to any one who wants a tablet.","rating":5},{"comment":"This tablet is greatest, fastest and easiest to use. The screen resolution is better than expected and the build quality is exceptional. Recommended for web browsing, watching videos, gaming, designin, etc...","rating":5},{"comment":"Samsung has done it again. They are releasing tablets at very periodic intervals. Samsung's fourth generation of Galaxy Tab series is as expected and for this price point phenomenal. I have been using Galaxy Tab 2 and 3 and I am very much impressed with Galaxy line of devices.  In my opinion 8&#34; is the maximum value for the money and features and hence I gave 8&#34; a 5 star. If you are looking for playing games\/reading books, 10.1&#8221; is good. I really wish this had a better resolution. Hence only 4 stars for pixels per density for this tablet.Samsung has introduced 7&#34;, 8&#34; and 10.1&#34; of the Tab 4 series. This year the space has become crowded as Samsung also has 8.4&#8221;, 10.1&#8221; and 12.2&#8221; Tab Pro Series. They are pricier, but if you can afford I very STRONGLY suggest you get the PRO series just for one thing - RESOLUTION. I was really hoping the Tab series will go to a larger resolution. But again price\/performance is a factor that drives Samsung to make devices at all ranges.Let's start off with salient points of all of the Galaxy Tab 4 series. I will later compare with the previous Tab 3 models. I have also listed brief specs of current leading tablets at the very end if you would like to really compare and shop. If you have Tab 3, don&#8217;t upgrade. No need to. Those devices worked well a year back and still are. The photos look just as beautiful on them as they did a year ago!Some Tab 4 specs have certainly become better, but not in a revolutionary sense. The pixels per inch ppi is the best in 7&#8221; among all of Galaxy Tab 4 series. That is because all have same resolution and size is the variable. For a first time user, you will be blown away by the feature set now. The tablets have multi user profiles, so each user can customize like a home PC.Look at three specs that really interest you and nail down the tablet you need. Look at the big picture, what you want from a tablet now, a year from now, what your family needs out of this and make a decision.7-inch Galaxy Tab 4 tablet: 1280x800, 216 ppi, 1.2 GHz Quad-Core, 1.5GB RAM, 8GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD card slot (up to 32 GB), Camera: 3MP rear-facing, 1.3MP front-facing and weighs 9.74 oz.

Android 4.2I am not going into other details like accelerometer etc. as they are all standard these days, Audio support - AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA\/ASF, 3GA\/M4A, FLAC, WAV; MP3\/MP4\/Music Tones; Music Player; Ringtones, Polyphonic. Video support: AVI\/DIVX, WMV\/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4\/3GP, WEBM; Video Player; Video Streaming.The 10.1&#34; has a physical home button so are others in the series.  Also has capacitive Back and Menu buttons. Camera is a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera for skype, and a 3-megapixel rear-facing camera. It is also equipped with an IR blaster so it will work as a universal remote on both your TV and cable box. Camera is only so and so, and I will not rely on it to produce outstanding photos. Weighs very lightweight. SD card capability is awesome! With prices plummeting for microSD GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 64 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. Get this mobileUltra (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging.This has Bluetooth 4.0&#34; and have USB Host. USB Host is one of the most under noticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless.  GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.Finally, believe me, don't get mired in the spec game. All devices perform most of common functions.7&#8221; Tab is smallest, portable8&#8221; Tab is biggers, readable8.4&#8221; TAB PRO awesome crisp resolution - Best pixel density of all 6 Tab 4 and TAB Pro versions10.1&#8221; TAB gameplay10.1&#8221; TAB Pro games\/books\/sharper resolution12.2&#8221; Bring on the books and Glossy magazines!If you are reading books, browsing, listening to music, looking at photos, playing games 10.1&#34;is definitely great. Samsung is creating markets for all form factors and I would consider this as an exploratory stage. Just like Ford or Toyota has cars in different shapes, sizes and price range, so are the tablet vendors now. Remember the laptop wars, 10&#34;, 12&#34; 13&#34;, 15, 17 and even some 19&#34; if I remember right few years ago. We used to debate endlessly which laptop sizes are better, which has better speakers and so on. The time has come to fight it out for tablets!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera\/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.WolframAlpha (I can go on for hours praising this.

Installation was a piece of cake (just follow their video instructions or check out iFixit). This was exactly what I needed! The aluminum enclosure is pretty sweet as well, being able to reuse the original drive is a great idea. The JetDrive toolbox software they have on their website worked perfectly for enabling TRIM on the ssd and lets you see its SMART status. All in all a really well thought out product.","rating":5},{"comment":"The enclosed manual is a little vague on how to do the backup\/restore process. Go to their Youtube page instead. I managed to buy additional years of using my MBA.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is an excellent upgrade for any 64GB or 128GB Mac Air. Installation is tricky, especially if, like myself, one has never opened up a Mac Air before, but there are some very helpful videos on YouTube. The videos produced by OWC memory sales were particularly helpful.There is always an urge to get a new upgrade installed as quickly as possible, but anyone who buys this upgrade should take the time to walk through the entire upgrade process, especially cloning the new drive. I also suggest having some ziplock bags handy as temporary storage for the screws removed from the Mac Air, unless spares are available.The overall performance of the SSD upgrade has been excellent, although installation of the Jet Drive Toolbox software is also highly recommended. This will provide all of the SSD software tools needed for the upgrade. I strongly recommend this upgrade from a price and performance perspective.","rating":5},{"comment":"My 2011 MBA drive stopped working, found this drive at Amazon, so for $189 the storage capacity went from 120 GB to 240 GB not bad. the instructions were not good but the video on amazon was helpful, took me 5 minutes to install the drive, the case for me was useless as my original drive won't work, booted my mac to via Wifi, on boot up used the disk utility to format the drive, used the time machine backup from time capsule to restore, few hours later everything came back to where it was last week with 120 GB more capacity. Good product to have. Apple store was asking $450 to fix the laptop with 120 GB drive. so this product was better option than apple.Got the drive in 4 days with free shipping.","rating":5},{"comment":"1 star for installation instructions. For me, they didn't work.5 stars for the product itself.To give you some background, I've been tinkering with computers for decades (since 1962) and have performed countless hardware upgrades. I read the instructions that came with the kit, watched the video several times, and downloaded the pdf from the website. I absolutely could not copy the original SSD to the upgraded version using those instructions.I wound up restoring from a Time Machine backup to the upgraded SSD and then installing the new SSD in the Mac. Cloning software like Carbon Copy Cloner probably would have worked too.So far, so good. The Mac seems quicker and I really needed the room.I must say that if you're not familiar with cloning disks, I'd give this a pass or find a knowledgeable friend to help out.Edit: the restoration from the time machine backup caused the loss of some settings. I had saved the original drive without altering it and used Superduper to clone the original to the upgraded SSD. I did this by using the option key to boot from the original SSD in the external enclosure, and cloned from that to the new drive now living in the Mac. Subjectively, the Mac is about 20% faster.","rating":3},{"comment":"The kit includes both sizes of pentalobe screwdrivers you'll need--one to open the case and the other for the single screw that hold the SSD in place. Also included is as USB 3 (2 compatible) enclosure for the new SSD (clone old SSD to new) and to put your old SSD in when you're done. A USB cable is included as well. The fit is perfect in your MacBook Air.You can use Disk Utility or a third party utility like Carbon Copy Cloner to clone your old SSD to the new one.  If you want the new SSD to have the Recovery HD partition on it, it's best to download the Mavericks installer and run it on the new SSD before you clone your old SSD to the new one. You don't even have to let the Mavericks install boot to the new SSD before you clone. There is free software online that supposedly installs a Recovery HD partition on a drive but I've had some trouble in the past so I just use a Mac OSX installer.After installation and after the Spotlight database was rebuilt, I checked the speed. For large block, sequential transfers, the write speed is over 300MB per second and the read speed is over 500MB per second. That's in a 2011 MBAir. A 2010 model won't be quite that fast. It's much faster than the Apple SSDs that come in the 2010-11 MacBook Airs and you can tell its faster right away in terms of boot time, app launch times, Finder operations, etc. It basically feels like I have a faster MacBook Air. Finally, I recommend the free Trim Enabler to enable operating system trim support as compared to the Transcend software that can be downloaded. You can also find equivalent Terminal commands, but Trim Enabler is so much easier.Bottom line: Installation is easy and it fits perfectly...and it's really, really fast.","rating":5},{"comment":"Updated my late 2010 macbook air.

Re-boot from the Mac drive and get an error message for the Transcend Drive stating \"OSX Can't Repair The Disk...\".Looked in the Transcend package and found that there is absolutely NO WAY given to contact them.  Looked at their web site for the JetDrive 500 and there is absolutely NO WAY to contact them.  Looked at Transcend's more general website and found a support contact form that I filled out.  They say that they'll get back to me in two or three days.We'll see.  By that time this thing will be going back to Amazon.UPDATE:  Received a couple of solicitous emails from Transcend asking me if I followed the instructions outlined in a downloadable PDF file and\/or available via video.  Of course the instructions weren't included in the box nor was there any information regarding the existence of the PDF file or the video.So, at Transcend's request I tried one more time, using the Restore function of Apple Disk Utilities and EUREKA! it worked.  So my rating goes up from one star to two or three.  Transcend's instructions still suck and they don't give you any way to contact them for support.One last note:  after booting up the new Transcend drive and trying to run Excel and\/or Word from Microsoft Office 2011 I was prompted to re-enter the Product Key from the original install DVD.  I have that DVD so it's not a problem for me but be sure that you can lay your hands on the original Office 2011 install DVD or you'll be out of luck regarding Office.","rating":2},{"comment":"I had been watching the OWC version of this for some time but at $600 give or take, I just couldn't justify the purchase.

I do a lot of video editing and was thinking about picking up a TB external firewire SSD to help with on-the-road editing. The JetDrive was intriguing because not only would I gain an additional 500GB internally, but I'd have an extremely capable and portable external drive, made of my internal 500GB Apple SSD. Overall, I am very pleased with the drive and the external enclosure for my OEM drive. Here are the pros and cons I've come up with after a few months of use:Pros:- Very easy to install, takes less than 5 minutes- Migration is easy, made large in part by how OSX works- As fast as my OEM drive. Average 400MB\/s write and 450MB\/s read.- TB internal drive, what's not to like?- External USB 3 enclosure is as good as it gets. Super fast (I use for FCPX projects with no issue) and super portableCons:- My wake from sleep time is now about 5 seconds, Apple OEM drive was 1 second- Boot time is now about 45 seconds, OEM drive was about 15I did the copy-style migration, where you basically copy your existing drive and swap them out. This is the first time I've done that type of migration. When I have some downtime, I may do a clean OS install on the drive and use migration assistant from my time machine backup and see if this alleviates some of the boot\/wake delay.Other than that, normal performance is great and having the extra breathing room for internal storage has made my life so much easier. Now if they could just come out with a 2TB version!","rating":4},{"comment":"I have a 256 GB SSD in my MBPR and needed more internal space.For the past year I have been using an external SSD thunderbolt drive and a USB3 spinning disk.The first thing I noticed when I attempted to restore my 200GB OS partition was that it was slow. It took over 4 hours to move.When I opened the case to install the SSD module in my computer it was about 1 millimeter to long. It looks like I could have sanded the edge of the SSD module to make it fit, but at $600 I was not comfortable taking the chance.Since I did not have the SSD installed I can not judge the performance, but I can't figure out why it was slower than my WD My passport drive when connected to USB3.","rating":1},{"comment":"Hot dignity, that was easy.

This comes complete with everything you need including the screw drivers to remove the screws on your Macbook Air. I did this procedure in 7 minutes flat. I installed this on a Macbook Air 11&#34; A1465. I put the new drive in the enclosure and connected with the USB. Booted into recovery mode by holding the option key. Went into disk utilities and formatted the new drive. Then cloned it (no extra software needed function built  into OS X). I then shut down, removed the screws, removed the back, gently unplugged the battery cable (identifiable by + and - symbols near HD). Took out the 64GB drive. Installed my new drive. Booted straight into OSX no problem with the new drive. Then I downloaded the JetDrive utility on their website, turned on TRIM. Rebooted.

I have so much space free now that I could copy the 4 Windows VMware Fusion VMs back to the single drive on the system from the external drive they were previously on, and added 120GB a Boot Camp partition for Windows 8.1 w\/ Updates to run in both natively and in VMware Fusion.I wish the MacBook Air was RAM upgradeable so I could run more than one VM at a time (I have 4GB RAM and configure my VMs for 2GB, which leaves 2GB for OS X, and 2GB for VMware guest OS's).The enclosure that came to use the original SSD as a super-fast external USB3 drive is great!  I can even boot from it and it doesn't let a perfectly good SSD go to waste!I knock off one star (but really should be 1\/2 or less if Amazon allowed it), because the Trancend JetDrive Toolbox isn't an identified developer as of the latest OS X Mavericks update 5\/2\/2014.  This means to use it, I need to go into the System Preferences>Security & Privacy, and allow apps downloaded from anywhere to run.  I changed the setting once, to enable TRIM support (TRIM is only enabled on Apple first party SSDs--hacks\/utilities like the JetDrive Tooxbox needs to make configuration changes to OS X to enable TRIM for 3rd party SSDs).  Once I used the JetDrive Toolbox to enable TRIM, I set the setting back to only allow identified developers and won't be using the Toolbox very often.Also, Dropbox detected the drive change and asked me to log-in again, and Mac Microsoft Office 2011 asked me to re-activate.  But otherwise, everything else went smoothly.Hopefully Transcend gets their utility on the list of identified developers soon so this problem can be alleviated.  But for now, I no longer have to swap my VM's in and out of my system, and the enclosure has given me the fastest 120GB USB3 drive I've ever had!  I highly recommend this product if you're running out of space on your MacBook w\/ a SATA SSD.Update 5\/12\/2014:  As Transcend noted, they've updated their software and it now runs without having to reduce your system security.

Before I received the drive, I called OWC to see if they would price match, and the answer was no. So, I thought Shame on Me. OWC's pricing was $449. for a bare drive and $475. for one that included tools and an enclosure for the old SSD. (OWC's pricing has since been reduced to $398. and $419. respectively) I opted for the bare drive. I installed the drive, and as others have noticed, the vertical dimension of the circuit board the components are mounted on is a millimeter or 2 larger than the stock SSD. Others have cut the board, I didn't, I applied a little pressure and it snapped into place. OWCs installation video is, IMO, far better than the Transcend video. Once set up, the SSD seemed to work fine, for awhile, but less than a day later, the drive started giving me problems. I tried repairing it with both Disk utility and Tech Tool Pro, both to no avail. Two days later it happened again. I called OWC and asked for an RMA. They agreed but said I would have to pay a restocking fee and pay for return shipment. I challenged that, saying this was not a capricious return, that the unit was defective and I expected OWC to pay for shipping and refund the full amount. They agreed, and sent me a UPS label.When ordering the Transcend JetDrive I was quoted a delivery time of from 2 to 4 weeks. The unit was shipped 3 days after the order was placed and I received it one day later, that's 4 days after order placement! The price of the JetDrive 480 GB SSD from Amazon was $350. + Sales Tax (OWC charges no tax in Arizona). If I could have waited longer, I could have bought it from my memory Supplier, Data Memory Systems and not paid Sales Tax, but Transcend has not yet supplied it's distributers with this product.Upon receipt of the JetDrive, yesterday, the first thing that jumped out at me was the packaging. The OWC SSD came packed in an anti-static bag enclosed in a thin gauge blister packed piece of cardboard with blue printing. It looked the packaging used by Ace Combs. The Transcend packaging on the other hand was impressive. A heavy gauge white slide out box with a full color picture of the SSD. The box was multi layered and contained the drive, the enclosure for the OEM drive, and the tools necessary for installation. Each layer was a plastic bed with depressions sized to fit the associated parts. It also contained an instruction booklet and warranty information. The instructions are, IMHO, inadequate, and only two pages apply, the other 26 pages being written for other languages.The tools worked very well, and installation was a breeze. the form factor of the circuit board is the same as apple's so no undue pressure was needed for installation. My old SSD fit into the supplied enclosure with no issues.I then cloned the JetDrive using Tech Tool Pro from the external Hybrid Drive I had been using as the main drive for my MBA. I foolishly ordered my MBA with only the 64GB SSD.No issues. Everything is working as expected. In terms of speed. I have not measured the speed, but it feels very snappy. I believe the OWC and Transcend drives to be equal here. Transcend even supplies software to enable Apple's Trim support, OWC does not. There is however, third party software that enables Trim, Trim Enabler. I use that anyway for the SSD I use in my Mac Pro.The Transcend drive seems to run color than true OWC drive. When feeling the bottom of my MBA where the SSD is mounted, the area while warm, is not as warm as it was with the OWC unit.In ending, I would urge anyone installing the JetDrive in a MBA to watch the OWC installation video, again, it is superior to the Transcend video, and will make things more understandable to you.The JetDrive is by far the superior product, and as of right now is $69. cheaper than the OWC Aura Pro. When I bought the OWC product, it would have cost $125 more than the corresponding Transcend product.That IMHO is Value.Currently, Apple charges $500. to go from a 128GB SSD to a 512GB SSD in the MBA. So, $350. for a 480GB SSD AND you get to keep your old drive, you can't beat that.The Transcend drive seems to run color than true OWC drive. When feeling the bottom of my MBA where the SSD is mounted, the area while warm, is not as warm as it was with the OWC unit.","rating":5},{"comment":"What is shown in the box and on Transcend's web site isn't good enough. I had to do a lot of online research to get this drive working. There are a LOT of details left out of their videos and printed material relative to imaging the drive, etcetera.I'm running Mavericks by the way. I erased and re-imaged this drive 3 times before everything worked.Basically the software documentation leaves A LOT to be desired, so be prepared unless you are a total Mac expert.The BEST part of their kit were the magnetic screwdrivers. However, a word of warning, the screws (except for 2 by the hinge) are Very Tiny. You had better be doing this in an area where you can find them, as I can't imagine any place where you could buy a replacement screw.Oh yeah! I almost forgot! Find a suction cup to lift the bottom off of your Mac once you've removed the screws. It doesn't exactly just pop off and you don't want to scratch or dent it.Also when you mount your old SSD in the external drive holder you use these same odd screwdrivers, so don't lose them should you ever wish to open the external casing.Anyway all is well now, but it sure wasn't as easy as all these other reviewers make it out to be.By the way I've been building my own computers since the SS-50 kits in the 70s, so I'm not a newbie at opening up computers and doing upgrades.","rating":4},{"comment":"The Buffalo WHR-1166D AirStation AC 1200 Dual Band Wireless Router is both full featured and rather typical of current model routers on offer in July 2014. The progress of wireless routers has been both steady and towards increasingly powerful bandwidth, able to accommodate and maintain high thru-put streams to multiple users at once. The various router makers all have the same \"recipe\" problem in that they are sourcing components from chip developers that make the same new features and new standards available to all makers buying the base chips at the same time, so no one maker has much of an edge on any given feature except being the first to market, having a gimmick to their implementation, the style of the user interface, or packaging.Having had to chance to try a wide range of wireless routers the past couple of years I can say after trying out the Buffalo WHR-1166D that the Buffalo WHR-1166D is completely competent in all its functions, which as mentioned are becoming increasingly generic, that it did not call attention ti itself in a bad way, and looked good. If all that sounds just a but unhelpful -- where are the head to head stats of micro difference and testing of nano incremental strengths and weaknesses? - then it's because wireless routers have become pretty much like microwave ovens and DVD players. There are differences, but they come down mostly to styling and control layouts, and perhaps user pride of ownership if the product has managed to create a mystique about its brand.The Buffalo WHR-1166D is a very good 866 + 300 Mbps dual band 802.11n and 802.11ac wireless router, with Gigabit WAN, four LAN ports, etc. If it has a shortcoming relative to other models on offer it is that it does not have a USB or SATA port for connected storage or printer. But as a straight wireless router it's very competent, priced right, and a good choice in the very crowded market","rating":4},{"comment":"This router generates a strong signal throughout my home and if anything has increased the range. It's not anything I can measure because I have a lot of steel in the house and that creates an interference offset. I like the dual band routers because I have kids. My kids normally use way more Mbps than I do with their gaming and streaming content. This way I am keeping some bandwidth reserved for myself since connectivity is critical. It has a 2.4 GHz band and a 5 GHz band, and it has two internal antennas.Security seems pretty good. I'm using WPA2 and am also stopping some potentially unwanted content through the onboard ConnectSafe software.The setup was quick. This comes with a 3-year warranty and 24\/7 tech support.","rating":5},{"comment":"Update:  Be sure to update the firmware.  My wireless was dropping occasionally, then was showing as Limited a few times.  I spoke with Customer Service via email, who are absolutely wonderful and contacted me fairly quickly, and they suggested I change channels and to also update my firmware, and I've had no more problems since that time.I'm super happy about the size of the Air Station.  It's about 6 inches tall, and takes up less space than any other router I've owned. Also, the power plug only takes up one slot on my power strip rather than two.  However, there is no on\/off button, so the cord has to be unplugged to turn it off, which is annoying, especially since my power strip is under my computer desk.The benefits of the Air Station are that it supports the new 802.11ac standard and reportedly does simultaneous wireless speeds up to 1166 mbps, and the Wan port is ready for fiber optic speeds if and when your ISP upgrades to fiber optics.  There are also 4 Lan ports on the unit.You can either use the AC 1200 as a  Wireless Accent Point or a Bridge or you can choose to let the unit decide and that's exactly what I did.  There's a switch on the unit that lets you choose between Router, Bridge and Auto.  Although I know what an access point is, I didn't understand the difference between a bridge and an access point, so I left it on Auto and that worked well.The instructions are skimpy in my opinion, but I did manage to get it set up fairly quickly.  There is supposed to be a Setup Wizard to help with setup but it didn't pop up for me but I just went into the router's management page (192.168.11.1) and added my username and password under the Internet menu, refreshed the page and it worked fine and we are loving it.I recommend it just for the size alone.  My last TP-Link was huge, so I do appreciate the smaller size.","rating":5},{"comment":"I opened the package up and got this to hook up to my 56mbps internet connection modem.  In theory, one should be able to attach the cables, power on, then type in the password on the underside of the router to get going.  The standard IP of any router admin page is 192.168.1.1.  Unfortunately, Buffalo wants to be \"different\" by having it to be 192.168.11.1 so watch out for that.  The admin page isn't quite as intuitive as I've seen on other routers, even cheaper ones.Note that those using dynamic dns services for free may want to avoid this router because it only supports dyndns and tzo, neither of which is free anymore and you can't add a custom one to the router interface.  This is important for those wanting to access webcams, security cams, or other devices remotely.On my old router, I had my I7 desktop attached by cord to the router on a gigabit LAN so it took advantage of the 56mbps internet.  After configuring the 802.11n wireless on this to use channel bonding, I was able to switch to 300mbps mode.  The speed fully took advantage of my 56mbps Internet connection (note that 300 mbps is only \"theoretical\" top speed so real-world always needs to be analyzed).Took my power meter and this idles w\/o active data streams at about 7 - 8 watts.  With a full 56mbps download stream, it took 8 watts.  Those with high power rates will want to consider the watts because it's likely you will have this on 24\/7  so find other quality reviews that give you this information when choosing to buy a router.Ergonomically, the unit is weighted down enough to avoid the cables contorting it around while sitting on a table or shelf.  It looks nice and doesn't have any hideous look like some others you might find these days.  The LEDs are not that bright which to me is a good thing because I don't like the Christmas tree effect.One major quirk is that the LAN ports are only 100mbps! That's not good because not every device will be wireless.  For this, a full star off because it is unacceptable at the price range.Overall, not a bad unit.  The lack of gigabit LAN may not matter to some, but it's something that wouldn't have added much cost for them to build it in.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a current standard wireless router that will run at ac speeds, which my Macbook my Mac Mini and iPad do just fine. I put it in my office and it works well enough. At home I tested the range against my Airport Extreme. The Apple router. I  get good reception on my Macbook in our detached garage but none at all when running the AirStation. Not a big deal, I've tried other routers and none have quite the range of the Airport Extreme.One thing to note: This is advertised as having gigabit speeds on the incoming ethernet port. That's only on the incoming signal. If you live in a place that has fiber optic internet connection, great. Most of us won't need that kind of WAN speed. And the gigabit is only on the incoming port. All the ethernet connections for local network connections are the old 10\/100 &#34;high speed&#34; ports. Since my computers and NAS are capable of gigabit ethernet that doesn't help LAN connection speeds at all. This is the first router that offers faster wireless connection than wired. I tested the connection speed by copying my music connection between computers, about 36 GB. The transfer speed timed out to about 300 mbps, much faster than the wired speed of the network.I've been trying to find a way to password protect the router from access on the setup address (192.168.11.1) but can't seem to find that setting. Since password protection is necessary for accessing the network, that's probably not a security problem.","rating":3},{"comment":"The router was easy to set up, and the AC WiFi was really fast on my tablet and phone, but it was not compatible with either of my computers.  AC is fairly new, so make sure your device is compatible.  I didn't like that their lower quality routers had more features than this more expensive one.  It's the only router out of all of their routers that does not have gigabit Ethernet over WAN and LAN.  It just has WAN.  I didn't understand why.I could not get bridge mode to work, and it would not even recognize that the router had a signal.  I also didn't like that it did not have a USB share port, which some less expensive routers have.  For some people, though, that might not be a big deal.  If the issues I have mentioned don't bother you, it is a good router, especially for people with a lot of devices like smart phones and tablets.","rating":4},{"comment":"OUT OF THE BOXOut of the box, there isn't much to say about the router itself. You've just got a router, power, network cable, and quick start guide. Although it's technically fully setup and ready to go when you plug it in. It's already got a unique access point name and password setup. There's even a physical switch that allows you to switch between Auto\/Router\/Bridge modes. Other than changing the default router password and other optional advanced settings, you almost don't even need to ever log into it's web interface.Just connect everything as the diagram indicates, and it's pretty much ready to provide wireless and wired internet connectivity.FEATURES & SETUPThe router has a pretty basic and easy to navigate web interface that allows you to make all of the changes you need. Which is also mobile friendly, should you prefer not using a PC. The AC 1200 doesn't have a lot of additional features. There's a guest mode, parental control, and that's about it.To continue advanced setup or go with custom settings, you'll want to make sure it's in Router mode, regardless of your home setup. This is the default mode, such as when you have it connected to the modem directly. There is a nifty card on the bottom of the router which has the IP, password, and everything you need to jump in and start setting it up.Which is exactly what I did to change the access point names, passwords, setup a static IP, and other less common \"advanced\" changes I do to make it work with my network. I've already got a separate server and router. All this thing needs to do is provide speedy WiFi. Otherwise functionality is completely the same.This was all pretty straight forward, except I did run into my first issue when going into \"Access Point\" or \"Bridge\" mode, which is that it disable the ability to access the router's web interface. I updated the firmware, reset it, all no go. Per Buffalo tech support, the router defaults to a 192.168.11.100 IP address when going to Bridge mode. Unfortunately I still wasn't able to access it after troubleshooting, and there doesn't appear to be a way to change this functionality.PERFORMANCEI have 802.11ac and 802.11n devices in my two-story house, so I have plenty of devices to test the performance with. First, the router does actually have a gigabit WAN port so that you've got the potential for a lot of speed via your ISP or Local Network connection. This seems like a no-brainer to have with an AC router, but you'd be surprised. The other 4 LAN ports are only 100Mb. As for WiFi, the router is dual band, and is capable of handling both 2.4GHz and 5GHz as the same time.For my initial test I used my Surface Pro 3 (Marvel Avastar Wireless-AC card) and a Dell XPS 11 (Intel 7260 WiFi card).  Both devices seem to be maxing out right around 25MB\/s file transfer speeds via my LAN connection with 5GHz on AC or N. 2.4GHz is naturally considerably slower, at around 10Mb\/s or so.It just doesn't seem to be capable of going faster than this. The router advertises speeds closer to 866Mb\/s. In reality, you'd looking at roughly 40-50% of those speeds, in optimal conditions. And we're talking only a couple feet from the router itself. Also note the difference between bits and bytes (there are 8 bits in a Byte and b=bit \/ B=Byte). 25MB\/s translates to 200Mb\/s, which is a bit less than I'd expect for an AC router. Especially since my older 802.11n router could easily achieve those speeds.PROS:+ Easy Setup+ Full gigabit WAN port+ Important features are present+ Small foot print+ AC can still be faster for some WiFi cardsCONS:- Less than expected AC wireless speeds- Web interface not available in Bridge or AP mode- LAN ports are only 100Mb- No advanced features such as QoS and high power transmissionCONCLUSION:Having an AC router will result in your AC capable devices likely performing better than they would with an 802.11n-only router. AC has better range and performance. I have since used other non-AC wireless cards transferring files over Wi-Fi with the Buffalo, and they're on par with what they did on my top-end D-Link 802.11n router. However, some newer AC wireless cards don't tend to do very well in non-AC environments. So there can be an improvement in performance, sometimes twice as fast.However, if you really want the most AC can offer, I'd suggest spending a little more and going for the higher end models that can really move some bits. After all, if you're going to upgrade, you might as well do it right. But if you're just looking for a low cost current gen Access Point, and don't need a lot of features or super fast speeds, this one would get the job done.","rating":3},{"comment":"This is a personal cloud drive\/backup device for Windows\/Macs\/tablet computers (Apple\/Android). In the box, you will find the LinkStation unit with 1 3 Tb drive installed, an 80&#34;(2m) Ethernet cable for connecting the unit to your router, a power cord, a CD with LinkStation software, and 2 paper quickstart guides, one for computers and one for handheld devices. The quickstart pages are image-based, language-free.Installation of the LinkStation unit took 20 minutes for me from the time I opened the box. Much of that time was actually spent puzzling over the quickstart guide, trying to deduce the meanings of the images since there are no words. However, once I figured out how to read the pictures, there were no false starts, and the drive was visible on my network as soon as I made my way to the end of  the quickstart guide. One odd point about the quickstart guide is that the photos seem to suggest the drive should be set up vertically for operation, with 60 mm (2.4&#34;) clearance from the sides and top. Yet, the device itself has vents on the two long narrow edges and solid broad sides. If you set up the device as shown in the pictures, one of the vented edges serves as the bottom of the device, facing the flat surface of your desk. The &#34;bottom&#34; vent suggests to me that maybe the device would get better circulation if set up horizontally so that both the long narrow edges are in the air as sides and the 2 solid broad edges serve as the top and bottom.Once the physical installation is complete, then comes the &#34;fun&#34; part--trying to actually set up the drive to share files. At the bottom of the quickstart sheet is a cryptic web address. I typed it in and found it was a link to the full manual, which I downloaded in PDF format. I began working my way through the manual. Chapter 2 had me open EasyAdmin and start setting up access to my drive. I changed my admin password and read through the advanced settings as shown in the guide. I installed the SmartPhone navigator app (for managing LinkStation access) on my Android tablet without any problems, but the WebAccess app would not install (wouldn't install to the default location), so I'll have to find some alternate method for accessing my files from my tablet. Chapter 3 is about setting up remote access. I followed the instructions exactly for set up for my computer, but got an error message &#34;WebAccess is not configured correctly. Click here to view the user manual.&#34; Clicking on &#34;here&#34; took me right to the very page I had been reading in the PDF manual. Instruction 6 on that page gave me a new Buffalo address to access. That took me to a sign in page, and my sign in was rejected because I didn't have an account, and there was no link on the sign in page to create an account. In reading back through the manual, it seems there ARE instructions for creating the needed account for handheld devices. So I had to go to my tablet to create the Buffalo account. Once I created the account and password on my tablet, I tried again to follow the instructions for setting up WebAccess on my computer. Still no go. I guess that's a battle to fight later when I feel like an IT challenge. Chapter 4 of the manual was about restricting access to shared folders, but since I haven't been able to set up WebAccess, I skipped that section.Chapter 5 of the manual was about managing storage, starting with RAID. Since this system has just 1 physical drive and I need all 3 Tb for storage, I guess I won't be using RAID features with this system. This chapter also notes how the LinkStation has a USB port that can be used to connect to USB drives, card readers, and USB printers, and how to replace the hard drive if it should fail. Chapter 6 describes how to backup from the LinkStation onto other drives. It also tells how to use Time Machine to back up from a Mac onto a LinkStation drive. Unfortunately, it doesn't tell how to use the LinkStation as a backup from a Windows computer. That's probably possible, but you would need to find and install your own Windows backup software and see if you can get it to communicate with the LinkStation. Since that's not covered in the documentation, I'll leave it open as a topic for further research and tinkering.Chapter 7 covers how to set up the drive for DLNA or digital media sharing. BitTorrent is also covered in this chapter. Chapter 8 covers advanced features, including email notifications for device errors, sleep mode for the drive (very useful for saving electricity or allowing access to files only at certain times), and data encryption. Chapter 9 covers utilities, such as NASNavigator 2, which enables you set up shared network drives.In general, I was pleased with how fast I could get this drive running out of the box. Unfortunately, the 2 tasks I wanted to use this drive for most, accessing files from my tablet, and backing up files automatically from my computer, are both going to take a bit of research and finagling to get going. I'll have to figure out why the WebAccess app won't install on my Android tablet and whether there's a work around. And I'll have to see if I can find some backup software to integrate with the LinkStation drive since the documentation doesn't mention how to backup from a Windows computer onto the LinkStation drive. Overall, this seems to be a decent piece of hardware and it connects readily to networks. Documentation for Apple device and Mac users seems straightforward, but many non-Apple users may find they will need to do a bit of independent research in order to get the device to work as it should.","rating":4},{"comment":"I live in terror that all the data on my laptop, items I've spent half a lifetime accumulating will disappear: source code, photos of my children, archived eMail, etc. My Dad, made the bad choice of backing up to a volume on the same drive as his originals which cost him a lot of lost data. So I try to keep things backed up. Now the first strategy is to make sure the most important stuff is on the cloud somewhere, thus I keep my software projects on bitbucket, and I have my most important photos in iCloud, but it's inconvenient to keep a terabyte of data in the cloud. So I have a Time Machine backup hooked up by USB to my monitor so that my MacBook can be regularly backed up, but when the drive in my laptop fails, and it will, I have the scary situation of having only one copy. So, I was happy to take delivery of this LinkStation as it promises Time Machine support and once backed up there I'll have two copies.For this purpose, Time Machine backup, you could buy an Apple product--the Time Capsule--and I would if it weren't so expensive, literally twice the price for 3 TB of storage, although it does come with an integrated WiFi router so it is not quite comparable. I'd assume it would also be simple to setup and aimed at the non-techie market.This product, is very much a techie product. Configuration is done through a frustrating series of web pages filled with edit buttons and a myriad of obscure features. It took me several minutes just to find out how to rename the server volume. And the first time I set up Time Machine, I accidentally did it to a guest viewable directory, something I don't want to do with my personal data.I have 1.15 TB of data on my laptop (a spinning disk and an SSD) and it took 23 hours to do an initial backup over what should be gigabit Ethernet. This was all quietly in the background but slower than I'd have expected. I've set Time Machine to alternate doing backups to the attached USB drive and this NAS so I should never be more than a few hours out of date while my MacBook is in the house.I also put a collection of videos in another folder and enabled DLNA serving. That works as well as DLNA sharing ever works (not a compliment). My Roku's media player app discovered it and I was quickly watching some old movies. Not the greatest browsing experience, but at least I was able to resume video playback and get smooth playing. I'd say it's faster at this task than a Seagate network drive I received last year.This product has iTunes Server, but as that service is pretty well neutered by Apple, I didn't even bother setting it up.So in the end, I've set it up, I've more peace of mind, it appears to be working. I don't hate it. But it could be easier to setup, and have better performance.","rating":3},{"comment":"If you've used any Buffalo NAS's in the past you'll be able to quickly set this up since it uses exactly the same web based GUI.For those new to Buffalo NAS it may take more time and research to get going.The manual says you don't even need a computer to set it up and that's what the \"SmartPhone Navigator\" and \"WebAccess\" apps are for but I suggest installing the NAS Navigator software on the CD since it's a lot easier and the EasyAdmin webpage looks a lot better and is easier to navigate that the phone app based version.For example, I know from previous Buffalo NAS that I have used that the included usb port can be problematic i.e not recognize most other external drives. At least they are more explicit in the manual about it now: Compatible USB devices include printers and Buffalo USB hard drives.And some of the settings in the web based GUI make no sense for a single drive NAS. I suggest making sure context help in turned on. This give a much better description of what all the different settings do.Once it's set up it's small, quite, cool and makes for a great DNLA, Twonky server which is what I use it for mainly and to backup my PC and Apple computers.To use if for Apple Time Machine backup's all you need to do is flick a switch to turn it on in the web based GUI and then it will instantly show up as a backup target for Time Machine.For Windows machines you can make use of the NovaBACKUP for backups.For the Twonky server I use the Twonky beam app on my iPod, iPad and Android devices to access videos,photos, and music stored on the NAS.Buffalo needs work on their iPhone and Android webaccess app to make it as easy to view videos,photos, and music stored on the NAS as Twonky beam.","rating":4},{"comment":"I had some difficulties getting the unit installed.  I followed the directions (not super easy since there are no words, only pictures) and got it on the network, but I could not get the webaccess to come up on my computer (I was able to access it through my iPad though) .  I went through all the normal troubleshooting tips--new browser, restart, reset, and nothing seemed to work.  I emailed customer support and they got back to me quickly and even checked back with me when I didn't respond within 24 hours.I moved after my first attempt to install the unit and when I moved I plugged it in and hooked it into my wireless router and then it worked.  I'm not sure what happened, but it all seemed to work after my move.  I did use the provided Ethernet cable as opposed to one of my own (I had tried 2 different ones in 2 different locations on the router), but I can't see how that would change anything.I had no problems getting it set up on my iPad, but I couldn't seem to complete the setup on my phone.  Once I had it done on my iPad, I was able to access it with my phone using the name I had setup on the iPad.Overall, I am pretty happy with the unit.  I can't say that it was easy to setup and install, so I don't think this would work for someone who doesn't have some understanding of their network.  It would be much better for someone who is willing to do a little troubleshooting.","rating":4},{"comment":"This product is a good idea overdone on the user side but nice for the techie who knows what he's doing.  It will back up everything and do so in the background but it takes time and the time one expends in the initial setup added to the back up time leaves you plenty of time to do it in longhand and laminate and still fit in nine holes of golf.  Of course this is probably the result of my greenhorning my way through that initial set up in the first place and the choices I made probably accounts for the slow times I'm experiencing in its actual use.  I wasn't impressed with the page after page of setup boxes that have to checked and on the server side good luck setting it up at all unless you've done this before.  I'll pass thank you.  But if you're a techie it's probably a five star product...I just have no way of knowing at my level of expertise.","rating":2},{"comment":"So, first the positives - the Buffalo LinkStation 210 3TB feels relatively sturdy upon first inspection, with the exception of the on\/off button that seems a bit too small and flimsy.  Noise levels are good, with only a slight whooshing sounds once it is fully booted up (4 minutes).  I even like the styling, with the monolithic black slab, red stripe at the top, and white LEDs on the front.  Overall, Buffalo did quite well with this unit and I believe for the tech saavy these personal clouds will be the future as they are more secure since you are hosting them and have control over the data.But, there is a pretty large downside for me, and I will update this review if that changes.  On the front of the box, it says &#34;Mobile Support, Access Your Content from Your Tablet and Smartphone Devices&#34; and &#34;Quick Setup with Mobile Device... no computer needed!&#34;  My Smartphone Device is a Nokia Lumia 928 (Windows Phone 8) and my tablet is a Surface Pro 3 (Windows 8.1 Pro).  Buffalo chose not to develop a SmartPhone Navigator touch app for either of these Operating Systems.  So, unfortunately, some of the biggest selling points of this unit simply are not available to a large amount of people.  The app is available on iOS and Android, but for a product like this where they have competitors with bigger pockets doing the same thing, Buffalo should have went the extra mile here and developed a Windows Phone 8\/Windows 8 app.  Also, it would have been nicer if the USB port on the back was USB3.0 instead of USB2.0.So, while it is a lot of space, sadly I am unable to use it as designed as Buffalo did not develop a Windows touch app.","rating":2},{"comment":"I am very pleased with the Buffalo, this is the second one I bought, because the 1 TB I bought a couple years ago isn't going to be enough to store all my stuff! I'm down to maybe 500 GB on that machine, and adding two more computers means it's probably a good idea to have a single network drive big enough to store everything, plus provides a second backup for important files.I love how the Buffalo NAS works. You plug it into your network (this one also allows direct connect by USB cable) and then you connect to it through your web browser. You log into the device and set up the root directories you want on the device. You also assign it a name for use on your network, and unless you either want to change the name or add or delete root directories, you never administer it again, everything else is done by using it as a networked PC, you can add subdirectories through Explorer and retrieve files simply by specifying  two backslashes, the device's name, and the root directory (and subdirectory, if needed) where the file is located. Applications treat files on this just like local files, plus I have an older Macintosh desktop I use for testing and it can access directories on the Buffalo as if it was local to the Mac.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is not a bad case for a tablet computer, and I like it. The material is nice, and the cover is flexible and can fold into a stand.But others who have commented are correct. The cost is rather high for what it is. Then again, I gather that most tablet covers cost a good deal. It seems to go with the territory.I'm glad, in any case, to have it.","rating":3},{"comment":"The Belkin adjustible tablet cover has pros and cons.PROS:*easy to put on tablet*fits securely*allows for camera use*sits up at a higher viewing angle or a lower typing angleCONS:*folding the tablet cover to stand up leaves the cover wavy when closed*the fold-back corner for the camera is a bit awkward*sometimes the folded cover\/stand gives way when you are typing*this cover is larger than my  samsung galaxy 3*it doesn't fit in my purseI used it for a week, then switched back to a case made for my actual tablet.","rating":3},{"comment":"This is actually a nicer case than I was expecting based on the images and description. It holds the tablet at one side and then at the  two corners of the opposite side, and it does a good job of keeping it secure, even when I swapped a few different brands of tablet in to see how it did.The shorter sides of the tablet are left almost entirely clear, and one of the longer sides as well, though the other long side is about half covered. There's an opening in the part that holds it, but I don't know how many cables will really fit through there to reach a port, so I wouldn't bet on using it that way. Overall, I'd say this makes it work better as a holder for tablets that have the ports for charging and such along the shorter ends so that they're sure to be easily accessible.The material feels pretty good, and the flap to uncover rear cameras is going to be a really nice touch in some tablets. In fact, even on an Asus MemoPad that has the camera in the center of the back, the flap folds far enough out of the way to allow camera use.One thing that is rather annoying is that it doesn't have any kind of strap that helps to keep the cover from flopping around, but I can see how adding one could be awkward given the overall design.This is certainly going to be a step down from buying a comparably priced cover for a specific tablet. There are some pretty amazing covers out there for popular tablets like iPads and  Samsung's offerings, that fit beautifully and are designed to make sure that the specific tablet you have fits as comfortably as possible into your hand.Buying a custom cover for each tablet you use, of course, tends to add a decent little chunk of money to the cost (unless you're waiting quite a while after release, until cheap options become available). If you happen to be a person who changes device frequently (either because you want to, or because you do work that requires familiarity with many devices), having a single cover that's pretty darn good is a whole heck of a lot cheaper than holding out for a fantastic separate cover for each device.If you prefer to buy a tablet and for several years until it absolutely can't function anymore, you're probably better off investing in a cover that's as good as it can possibly be for that tablet. If you have a lot of devices around and you end up switching pretty regularly, this is pretty nice. The suggested retail strikes me as a little too high, but it's in the ballpark as far as other covers go when they're first released.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a universal tablet case, and as such, it has the usual trade offs of a general purpose case versus one custom-made for a specific device. There are two unusual features that distinguish this case. The first one is intended, the top right part of the back cover folds outwards, allowing you to take pictures. This assumes that the camera on your tablet is on the middle or the right side (of the top of the back of the tablet). If the camera is at an odd location you can also try putting the tablet upside down since most (but not all) apps work upside down. This can be a handy feature if you take pictures with your tablet (not necessarily pictures as art or for social media, but utilitarian, eg receipts, documents, stickies, Evernote, etc).The second unusual feature is unintended but practical. If you are taking pictures with the tablet in portrait mode, you can fold the front of the cover in a triangle formation and use it to hold and stabilize the tablet while taking pictures. It is more practical than it sounds, although it may look a bit awkward to innocent bystanders observing you in action :)This has a different design, it is not the typical four straps at the four corners case. On the left side, there are two stretchable L-shaped tablet edge holders. They can stretch up to one inch diagonally outward from the center of the case. On the right side, there is a 3-inch long fixed placeholder. You align the right side of the tablet with the groove of this holder. So devices with buttons from the middle to middle-bottom of their right side will likely have those blocked.Because of the design of the case, you can easily hold on to the case instead of the tablet bezel. This reduces fingerprints and accidental touches on the screen. And wear and tear on the bezel. Some may like this. Others may find the extra case surface annoying. That's one of the usual trade offs with universal cases.The case has two usage angles, both with the tablet in landscape orientation. One is typing angle, and the other is a video watching angle. The video watching angle is stable when left undisturbed. If you frequently have to touch the screen, especially the top parts there is wobbling, so games and such may be too risky.The back of the packaging material states that the following tablets are officially supported (as in \"Guaranteed to fit and protect\"): iPad Mini, Samsung Galaxy TabPro 8.4, Note 8 and Tab 3 (7\" and 8\") and Tab 2 (7\") and Nexus 7.Indeed, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 fits fine and none of the ports are blocked. The microSD is on the underside of the device, so you have to take the tablet out of the case. But that's the case with even custom-built Note 8 cases. NOTE: there are two magnets on the back cover, that's how the case is held back when taking pictures. There is a lot of talk of magnetic cases interfering with the operation of the Note 8's digitizer and stylus so keep this in mind.It is important to note that this is a case for recent tablets. Recent as in thinner. If you have older tablets, they may not fit. For example, the original first generation 7 inch Kindle Fire is too thick to fit properly. You can sort of squeeze it in, and pressure may hold it in a bizarre way, but it's a very very iffy hold and not recommended. So anything at that thickness level (the Blackberry Playbook has the same outer shell) and thicker will not fit. I also tried an older Android 2.1 tablet and that too was way too thick for the case.In terms of tablet width and length, the 9 inch Nook HD+ is simply too long and too wide to fit in this case. So there's the upper limit.Because of the way the case is designed, a number of ereaders can fit, however, because ereaders are 6-inches, they look like they are \"lost\" inside the case. Like a kid wearing his older brother's clothes. Some may prefer this, others may find it too \"clothy\" (for lack of a better term).The Kindle Paperwhite fits fine and so does the Kobo Touch non-Glow ereader. The design of this case is a plus for the Kobo Touch which has a power slider at the top right corner that gets covered by many universal four strap cases. So a plus for Kobo Touch users.The classic Kindle with Keyboard fits sizewise but right side page turn buttons are blocked by the case's tablet holder. You can turn pages with the left side page turn buttons. Likewise with the basic Kindle ereader.The Nook Simple Touch non-Glow ereader also benefits from the design of this case. It is usually too wide for some of the standard four strap cases, but in this case, the stretchability of this case works for the Nook. Its right side page turn buttons are not blocked, but it's a little awkward to hit them comfortably. You still have the left side page turn buttons and the touchscreen, so not a big deal. When inside the case, there's about 1.5 inch of empty space on the top and on the left side of the case.The case comes in a not totally closed thin cardboardy color sleeve that saves up on material and the planet. It is very easy to open, just pull the case out. The case has a very mild new product smell, perhaps that's one of the reasons for the semi-open sleeve, so the case has time to breath and air out its new product smells.","rating":4},{"comment":"Fits my Kindle Fire nicely and also fits my husbands HD just as well.  It's a high quality, basic case but it does the job quite well.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a case for their 7 or 8 inch tablet regardless of what make and model.","rating":5},{"comment":"I was very excited to get this case.  I had originally got it with my Kindle 2 in mind which is an 8 inch tablet.  However, when I got it installed in this case, to my disappointment, the corners that hold the table in, interfered completely with all of the buttons on the Kindle.Okay, so I moved to my 7 inch tablet- Acer Iconia A1 830.  It did fit, but honestly, it is not as nice as the 7in case I have made specifically for it.  The back does bend down to take a photo, and it does stand up, but not quite as stable as I would like.The texture of this case is rubbery and does make for a nice water resistant cover.  The plastic corners do hold the tablet firmly in place and adjust well.  The side has a slit so you can access any slots.  The cover does extend past the edges of the tablets for good protection.This case\/cover is okay, but I just don't feel it is as good of a fit as I had hoped for my Acer Iconia or my Kindle 2.  Perhaps other brands would work better.","rating":3},{"comment":"I don't understand how Belkin sells things like this, as they charge so much more that other products that are so much nicer  in terms of quality.This item in particular seems strange, because it's a generic tablet case, in that different sizes will bit into it. That's not a good thing because it means that it's not the right size for anything.However, what's most off-putting is that when I took it out of the box it was already dirty. Both the outside and inside of the case are a sort of rubbery plastic, with the inside feeling slightly more suede-like. The problem however, is that part of both inside and outside already had marks on them (for lack of a better word) that didn't seem caused by rough handling. On the inside in particular, the faux suede looks nice but it shows handling. it's the kind of thing that I suspect a damp lint-free towel could smooth our, but then you'd be doing that all of the time I suspect. You can't really tell it from the images, but the places where the tablet is held (on the bottom of the tablet and on the two opposite corners, will rub against that material and make it look worn.Also, the large size (it seems much more elongated that it needs to be, means that for many tablets (I've tried a Nexus 7 and a Mac Mini) it's larger than you need, which makes holding it in book fashion awkward.Other than that, it's functionally OK, and it's at its best if you fold the front cover back and use it to prop the tablet in landscape orientation to watch a movie.But why would you pay $40 (as I write this review) when you can buy, for easily half that, a case designed for your exact model?","rating":2},{"comment":"I love this tablet cover. It fits securely and is adjustable. The back folds down to access the camera. It folds to stand the tablet up. It's lightweight and unencumbersome but is protective for the tablet.

The case has a non-slip texture that make it feel secure in your hand.  The tablet mounting method (one long side clip and two opposing corner clips) keeps the the tablet in place no matter how much I shake it. There is a corner flap that can expose a rear camera if your tablet has one. The flipped-down corner is held in place by a magnet inside the case. There are a couple of weak areas. First, there is way to keep the case cover closed, which means the tablet is not  protected from random things sliding between the tablet screen and the case. The other weak point is the excessive movement in the hinges such that you may have to do a bit of adjusting to get it to a stable position when using the tablet at an angle. Unfortunately there is no way to stand the tablet up vertically in a stable position.","rating":4},{"comment":"This Belkin Universal Tablet case for 7 to 8 inch Tablets seems to be designed well.  It fits my Toshiba Excite 7.7&#34; Tablet very nicely and allows it to be charged directly from the case.  As far as Universal 7-8&#34; cases go, this is probably the nicest one I've used so far.  The material feels nice and it's thick enough to provide ample protection to the tablet... meaning I could drop my tablet from about 4 FEET to a hard surface and be pretty confident that my Tablet is still ok. No, I haven't put this theory to TEST... I'm not that brave of a Man and I'm not Rich enough to risk it, lol.  But I do like this case.  I wasn't sure what the Fold-able corner was for until I played with the case. No, it's not to be used as a &#34;stand&#34; like I had assumed when I saw the photo of the case.  It's actually to expose the Camera that is on most tablets these days...so you can take a photo\/video with it while it's still protected in the case.  I think that's pretty cool...even though I don't think I will actually use this feature much.  Anyways,  I would recommend this case to anyone who is looking for a nice, thin for their 7 to 8 Tablet.  The Pros and Cons below are for those who are too busy to read the whole review :)Pros:- nicely designed case that fits 7&#34; to 8&#34; Tablets well.- design allows for exposed ports to be used for charging\/headphones....etc.- fold-able corner tab exposes camera so you can take photos\/videos while it's in the case.- Material is thin, yet thick and resilient enough to protect tablet- Material feels nice ... like leather that has a slightly rubbery feel.  It's not made of either though... just so you know.Cons:-Can't really think of anything bad. If you're using this with a 7&#34; Tablet, the case edges may extend a but further than it needs to but that's because it's made for up to 8&#34; tablets.  This can't be helped (being a universal case), so I can't knock a point off for that.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Belkin Universal Case and Cover for 7 and 8 Inch Tablets is perfect for my Kindle Paperwhite.  When I write reviews, the Belkin is a good hands-free stand.  I just lightly touch the screen to turn the pages, and I can find the notes and highlights I need.  The Belkin doubles as hands-free stand for reading an ebook on your Kindle Paperwhite while sitting at a table or desk.  Since I use the Belkin case for my Kindle Paperwhite only, I cannot comment on its appropriateness for other devices. When I take my Kindle on the road, the Belkin is a waterproof and sturdy enough cover to keep my Kindle clean and protected.  So far, I am enjoying it very much.  It gets four stars because of the high price; it is far from a bargain.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a &#34;universal&#34; case for tablets with 7 to 8 inch screens. It was a tight but OK fit for my 8.1&#34; tablet and I removed\/installed it about four times before the attachment broke. I understand 8.1 is larger than 8 inches, but you have to stretch the corners beyond 8&#34; to fit an 8&#34; tablet, so stretching to 8.1&#34; isn't outrageous. If the margin for error is 0.1&#34; then I cannot recommend this tablet cover. Screen size is only one indicator of overall size and bezel and thickness will also affect the size. My Acer W3 didn't work, but they list the Galaxy Tab 2 and 3 7&#34; tablets, Google Nexus 7, Galaxy Tab and Note 8&#34;, Galaxy TabPRO 8.4&#34;, and iPad Mini.The attachment consists of a channel that hooks the bottom of the tablet and two rubber corners that are attached to elastic and which grab the two top corners at a 45 degree angle. The corners are sewn onto the elastic and the thread separated from rubber as if it weren't sewn properly. It came undone like a poorly sewn button.The attachments add bulk to the thickness of the tablet, perhaps a little more than 1\/4&#34;.

The case fit snugly to the 8.4 tablet as it was desgined for 7-8&#34; ones. To accomodate tablets of different sizes, the case has one top holder and 2 bottom holders on elastic bands that could be pulled out. I think I have stretched the 2 bottom corners as far as it could go for the Galaxy Tabs S.The case increase the size of the whole thing quite a bit, but it looks there is plenty of protection. There is a fold down tab on the case that allowyou to use back camera, if your tablet has one. Front cover dubs as leg for viewing angle. There is actually one viewing angle possible the way it was designed. Front cover also  doesn't close tight to the tablet, when it is closed, you can see gaps between the tablet and front cover, thanks to those hefty holders!Like anything designed as one size fit all, this case works and provides decent protection, but nothing worth bragigng about.

However, having now used the case for a few weeks, I think I generally like it.I'm using this with a second generation Nexus 7, instead of the Supcase case I had originally purchased for it. While I like Supcase products in general, I found that the power off was getting triggered too often when I moved the cover to the back of the case.For better or worse this Belkin case doesn't have an auto-power on\/off magnet, so that issue doesn't arise. However, it also means I must manually turn on the tablet, which after a few days of getting used to again, wasn't a big issue.This case also allows you to fold the back to angle the tablet. Unfortunately, after a few weeks use it's gotten fairly flexible, which means the available angles are limited. However, it does make for a nice holding spot, as I can grasp the angled cover in one hand, instead of resting the entire back on my palm.With a 7-inch tablet there is a bit of extra space within the case. However, this hasn't been an issue, as I've had no trouble with it getting tossed into my bag and then being messed up when I pull it out at work or home.Note that I have experienced that the volume down button is close to the clasp keeping a side of the tablet in. However, it doesn't cover it up, so it's not a big deal.I don't use the camera on my tablet, but the folding corner does open a rather great deal, so as not to block any shots. It also flips back easily, so there shouldn't be an issue with it staying open.The big issue is probably the price. At almost forty dollars the price is rather expensive. At half that it would be completely worth it. If you were using this for an 8-inch tablet it also might be worth around thirty. But with the quality of product you can get for less, I'd recommend waiting for it to drop in price.Based solely on the quality of the product, I give the Belkin Universal Case and Cover for 7-Inch and 8-Inch Tablet 4 of 5 stars, as it'll be staying on my tablet. Taking into account the price I'd have to drop off a star. However, since I'd expect the price to drop, I'll stick with a 4 of 5 rating.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a pretty basic cover, although it is flexible and nice to touch I am not sure it offers the greatest protection. It is not very attractive but serves it's purpose. I prefer a camera hole not the flip over, and the color is just fair. It is light weight and is made universally which I love. It is a fair enough cover and does fit my tablet but I feel like it only offers minimal protection and for forty dollars does not offer enough features to be perfect, just okay.","rating":4},{"comment":"I'm an avid user of cases for all my electronics (for re-sale value), but found this to be too large and bulky for a Nexus 7. It does work as advertised, but feels like a hardcover book jacket for a paperback. I've always been a fan of Belkin brand cases, but would not get this unless there are no OEM or custom fit cases available for your tablet.","rating":2},{"comment":"I guess this case exists for people who change tablets but don't want to buy a new cover?  Yes, it is flexible at holding different tablets but the flap is so awkwardly large & floppy.  It is easy to get the tablet in\/out & it has the ability to be used as a stand.I really do not care for this cover.  I prefer a neat and sleek cover for my tablet.  This is like my tablet is wearing pants that are 5 sizes too big & the belt is all that's holding them on.","rating":2},{"comment":"Belkin has a variety of other cases already on the market that are designed specifically for particular tablets. With this new universal case, Belkin seems to be trying to provide a rather generic version they hope will draw a broad base of customers who own any number of different name brand tablets. The one I am reviewing is geared toward owners of the medium sized 7\" to 8\" tablets.This Belkin cover has a tri-fold front and comes in two different combination colors: Charcoal\/Royal Blue and Purple\/Violet (The Amazon photo makes them look like the covers are black; They're not: charcoal or purple). The outside of the cover looks and feels like a smooth vinyl and the inside is a non-slip rubberized surface. The case appears to be sturdy and well-constructed and its dimensions are about 9\" x 6\" x \" and weighs in at 9 ounces. The cover can be folded to create two different horizontal (landscape) viewing angles; according to Belkin: one angle for \"Comfortable Viewing\" and another for \"Comfortable Typing.\" One odd thing I did notice while I was folding the tri-fold front cover into a stand was the tablet was in one horizontal viewing position with one stand configuration and it was flipped over in the opposite horizontal viewing position when I finished configuring the second stand. As long as your screen image flips around this oddity would have no negative impact. If it doesn't . . . you would be limited to only one stand position.The case inside the cover has one of the more interesting designs I've seen. Where most cases consistent of a tray or cradle, this one has a triangular 3-point securing system. There are two plastic corner brackets that are each attached to very strong elastic straps hidden inside the 2-layered cover and a third stationary plastic bracket at the point of the triangle. The stretch-to-fit corners allow the 7\" to 8\" tablets to be held securely in place. Installing a tablet into the case took a few seconds, and once installed it was firmly in place. I picked up the open cover by its tri-fold flap and jiggled it around a little to test just how securely the elastic corner brackets held the tablet. That tablet wasn't going anywhere!The tri-fold front cover uses magnets to hold the cover closed once the tablet is installed. Belkin added an additional feature in this case that was a little unexpected. Instead of trying to provide a cutout for those tablets that have a rear-facing camera, they instead designed flip down corner on the cover (see the photo on Amazon). The flap exposes the tablet's camera lens for snapping photos while it's still in the cover\/case. There is also magnet in the flap to hold it shut and keep it from flapping around when not in use. However, you have to hold down the flap against the back cover yourself while trying to take a photo; this was a little bothersome as far as I was concerned. Evidently, Belkin couldn't come up with a device to secure the flap in the open position. Some tablets have a rear-facing camera, but they are located elsewhere on the tablet. This essentially renders this clever photo flap useless for them. Yet, it's still so easy to insert and remove a tablet from this case that not being able to use the photo flap isn't really all that much of a loss.As far as it being universal for 7\" to 8\" tablets goes, I think I would drop the word \"universal.\" Here's why: (1) On the front of the commercial packaging is written \"For any Tablets 7\"-8\". (2) Elsewhere on the package front it reads \"TRUEFIT Guarantee for any 7-8\" Tablet.\" (3) On the back of the commercial packaging you can see \"Fits & Protects Any 7-8\" Tablet, Guaranteed.\" Now here is the confusing part also printed on the back of the commercial packaging: (4) \"Guaranteed to fit and protect:Galaxy Tab 7\"Galaxy Tab 3 7\"Google Nexus 7\"Galaxy Tab 3 8\"Galaxy Note 8\"Galaxy TabPRO 8.4\"iPad Mini\"Huh? One moment it's universal and the next moment it's for specific tablets. I'd say the commercial packaging needs to be improved, too.As far as a producing a basic cover and case goes, I thought Belkin did a pretty good job putting together a sturdy, easy to use product. I especially liked the triangular 3-point case inside the cover. It secured and protected our tablet better than any case I have tested.","rating":3},{"comment":"This was chosen for a Google Nexus 7 inch tablet.+  I really like the way the case expands and adjust to fit tablet securely.+  Attractive case.+  Allows you to prop the tablet up on a flat surface.+  Reasonably priced for item.

Not a bad deal, and doesn't feel cheap.","rating":3},{"comment":"I was looking forward to receiving this tablet cover, because the one I purchased with my tablet was not the one I would have picked had I had more than a choice of 2 covers, so I picked the one I thought I could embellish, because it's a solid black case.I always seem to pick the color blue if given the choice, so this tablet cover I thought I might like more than the one I already had.  I also like Belkin products, but this tablet case\/cover is totally useless to me!!!Yes it does technically fit my tablet which is 7\", but it sits at such an awkward angle, because the part that fits where the buttons are, it ends up covering part of one of the buttons, for me it's the one that raises the volume, which is annoying! Iam speaking about the top part of the case, not the part with the 2 corners that pull out.This tablet case\/cover has 2 corners that pull out, then above that is like a shelf, for the other end of your tablet.  This does NOT have 4 pull out corners, so to me it's not as secure as I would want it to be.I tried placing my tablet in this case\/cover two different ways, but my main issue with this case\/cover is that it is so flexible\/flimsy, that I find it totally useless trying to use my tablet with this case\/cover, plus it has nothing to hold the case\/ cover totally closed, so I wouldn't feel safe traveling with my tablet in this cover\/ case.  I just don't think this cover\/ case is secure enough for me to use it.  Plus there isn't any cushioning\/ padding at all in this case\/cover to protect my tablet.  To me that has to be essential!The best thing I can say about this case\/cover is the color, but that is not the kind of main selling point Iam looking for when trying to find a case\/cover to protect my tablet, which is really what you want a case\/cover for!  It also has to be functional, and this one is not!I think I will stick with the case\/cover that I already have.  At least it has 4 elastic corners, one for each end of my tablet, plus a long elastic strap that goes down the length of the case\/cover that holds the case\/cover closed.Maybe this is one of those instances where you need to see and try the case\/cover in person, to see if it suits your needs.  This one doesn't suit mine!!!","rating":1},{"comment":"I just recently purchased a Kindle Fire HDX and while this does fit this case, it doesn't really work well because it covers the holes and I have a case already that will automatically turn it off. So, would not recommend for Kindle.However, I have an older Samsung Galaxy Tab that is works just great with. For that reason I have to give it 4 Stars. It's flexible and you can slide the slot to fit 7 and 8 inch tablets. It also acts as protection if you drop it because of the rubberized material. It is pretty cool and pretty to look at. Easy to set up.","rating":4},{"comment":"I have a Dell Venue 7 tablet (obtained through the Vine program) and since it's not as popular as the ipads, Kindles and Nexuses, I can't find a decent case for it in stores. This case fits, although it's a tad large (made to fit both 7&#34; and 8&#34;) and feels very sturdy. The only problem with the corner holders is that they either cover up the power button or the charging socket, but I fault Dell for that design, not Belkin. I just remove one corner when the tablet is charging. The holders hold the tablet in very securely and the cover stays closed with a magnet in the lower lip. Outside is smooth, doesn't show fingerprints much and is a nice dark purple color.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have a 7&#34; Samsung tablet and this case is a terrible fit for it.  I realize it is made for both 7&#34; and 8&#34; tablets.  But that means there is a fair amount of wasted space around all edges of the tablet.  That makes it feel flimsy and harder to hold.  Also because it is a generic one-size-fits-some case, it doesn't work with the camera because is it partially blocked, even when the corner tab is folded down.  Do yourself a favor and buy a case specifically designed for whatever tablet you have.","rating":2},{"comment":"Seems to be a good quality product.  Has two tabs that extend to resize as necessary to fit varying degrees of tablet sizes from 7 to 8inches.  It feels good and strong when pulling the tabs out to fit the tablet.  Which is important as one doesn't want the tablet to fall out easily.  It also has openings around the table other than the tabs and the top holder - which means it will accommodate varying brands, etc. as on\/off switches and ports will vary per tablet.  The case folds back under itself to become a stand held by the strength of the magnet and the weight of the tablet.  It works!","rating":5},{"comment":"Was a bit skeptical of the &#34;Universal&#34; claim, but there is an interior tab and elastic system that works beautifully provided you get the right size case for your tablet. Very secure, easy to set up so the tablet is standing, it's quiet (unlike some tablet cases!) and it's very streamlined. Sure, maybe a few more color options would be nice, but that's not really a big deal. This is a great product for the price. I would say maybe an elastic to wrap around the whole thing would be prudent (you know, like Moleskines have)... because this one didn't come with one and it keeps flapping open. Hence the 4-star rating.","rating":4},{"comment":"It's okay, but not brilliant. If I had the choice between this cover and one that was specifically designed for my tablet or at least any 7\" tablet, I would choose it over this product.Pros:Construction - it is well made from durable materials.Holds product securelyRear flap folds down to allow the operation of a rear-facing camera (as long as it is in the center or to the right)Cons:The cover has a quite weak magnet to keep it closed.The power button on my ASUS MeMO Pad 7 ME176CX is not accessible.Many tablets, like mine, have a facility to power off when a magnetic cover is used. If the magnet used in this cover was larger then it would work, but in its present construction, that feature is not possible, which results in the tablet wasting its charge until it powers off, as per your power saver settings. Additionally, if this feature was operational, then reaching the power button wouldn't be such an issue since the tablet would power on when the cover is opened.Lastly, when the cover is closed on my 7\" ASUS MeMO Pad 7 ME176CX, it doesn't have a firm feel, and looking at the 7\" tablet in a cover that works for 7-8\" tablets, while the mechanism to accommodate both sizes is clever, it looks somewhat like someone wearing a sweater that belongs to a bigger person.","rating":3},{"comment":"I have a 7&#8221; Camelio tablet, being a butterfingers I figure getting a case for it would extend its lifespan.  The problem is finding one for an off brand tablet.  His Belkin Universal Case claims that it fits 7&#8221;-8&#8221; tablets and it sort of, almost fits mine.  The problem is the base of the tablet is too thick to fit in the bottom bracket.  There are two adjustable brackets at the top that do fit this tablet fine.  Even so, it does keep the tablet in the case fairly well, off all the times I have dropped it since putting it on, and the tablet has only popped out once.  There is also a nice feature where the back cover folds over so you can use the back camera, except I cannot use that function because my camera lens is in the middle.  The cover also folds into a nice stand to use your tablet but it is only nice if you like using the tablet the long way, I prefer to use mine the tall way so I really use the stand either.  I guess really the only nice bonus feature I do use is that is that it is easy to charge with the case on.","rating":3},{"comment":"This is a nice, secure and attractive case and cover for a 9-8 inch tablet.

This is a HUGE improvement in terms of weight, and there is no discernible difference in how it works. In a book on close-up photography that I got from Amazon, I found a suggestion for turning this zoom lens into a close-up lens by adding a Canon 500D lens. I was skeptical, but after taking it out on two outings, I think it will work well for me. The only problem is that the two lenses fight each other a little bit, and the Nikon lens tends to shift focus slightly as the lens wobbles, which naturally affects the photo. It takes some getting used to, but I'm starting to get the hang of it. Ultimately, I see these two lenses working in tandem as the workhorses of my little photography stable. Today I had the best day ever in 3 years of D-SLR photography, thanks to the new and improved 18-300 mm lens and the Canon 500D. Nikon should reintroduce its own close-up lens to provide the perfect complement to what I see as a nearly perfect lens for everyday use. I can't wait to see how time will improve it.

I'm pushing 800 pictures since I got the lens, and I've very satisfied with it.  There is some distortion at either end of the lens (barrel and pincushion), and there can be some vignetting, depending on aperture and zoom, but these are easily correct in a photo editing program and\/or RAW editor. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this lens.","rating":5},{"comment":"I got the lens 2 days ago and made several photos outside and indoor using it on Nikon D7000 in P mode. It is not bad.

As soon as it gets less sharp it gets noisy especially at max zoom.  I also own Sigma 18-250mm (very good lens). The bokeh on Nikon is not as pleasant as on Sigma (it looks smudged).

Nice and balanced, fast accurate focus, great zoom and all around if this is the only lens you have I can't see how you will be disappointed.

It might take a swivel or tilt of the antenna to bright them in 'perfectly', but that's simple to do. And just a 'note' to the reviewers who 'understandably' downgraded the suction cup base. I just want to pass-on this hint: You flip the lever up...wet the suction slightly...set the suction cup in place...and then pull-down on the lever to create a decent vacuum effect. The unit even now comes with a high-tech plastic 'thing-a-ma-jig' that turns even rough surfaces into smooth ones so that the antenna can grab-hold with its suctions base.

I don't work for Suspersonic...I'm just VERY pleasantly surprised that such a low cost item made all the difference in my ability to watch the all digital channels I couldn't bring-in with the Naxa-supplied antenna previously.","rating":5},{"comment":"I've tried 4 antennas.

Zilch!!","rating":1},{"comment":"This antenna actually works a little better than a $35 GE bar antenna (I needed one and it was the only model left at a local Walmart, and I'm not a GE fan). I do not use the suction cup or stem\/holder. I have taped it (the antenna sheet itself is flexible) to the upper portion of a window which always has the blinds half closed.  I went to antennaweb dot org and found that most of the towers are 262 degrees and less than 10 miles from my house while my antenna is facing due north. Rotating it slightly to the west helps, but since I prefer it flat against the window, it stays facing north. I do get UHF (local PBS), but again, that tower is less than 10 miles away. I also have a large sheet of foil behind the antenna (antenna taped to window, foil sheet on top of that). I'm giving it 5 stars because, so far, it does everything I need to to at a cheap price and the antenna is very compact and portable.I agree with other reviewers about the suction cup, it doesn't work\/doesn't work well. There is a thick gel pad included to stick on a non-slick surface so you can use the suction cup on that but this gel pad is smaller in diameter than the suction cup!","rating":5},{"comment":"Guess I'm one of those unlucky ones that didn't get good results from this little antenna.

The suction cup attachement could be a little better (it is a little top heavy) but other than that I (and my daughter) am very pleased.Jan. 23 2012I liked the first one so much I bought another. The first one went upstairs and it picked up all the local channels by just plugging it in. The second was placed on a downstars TV (almost directly below the first).

I am awarding it five stars on its meeting purchase expectations for doing what it is supposed to do. However, and this is a big &#34;however&#34;, the first one had a manufacturing problem in its Range Extender wifi module so it would not hold and often never make a link between the iPhone or iPad (both should work with iOS7 I am assured by DJI). After a week of working with DJI I finally returned it to the seller Luckitron who refunded the purchase price but not the $100 return shipping fee. A lack of wifi means you can fly the 'copter but not control its camera or see the status panel of the 'copter. Luckitron referred support to DJI. I then tried a different supplies H&B Photo in case there had been a bad batch. This one worked perfectly right out of the box and what an amazing flying camera it is. But on the 2nd flight, one of its motors started stuttering and not coming up to equal take off power of the other three. This has happened to others who used bolts for the prop guards (do a Google search) but in contacting DJI again they did not think that was the case this time since sometimes it would start up fine and other times it would stutter. They have taken it back for repair but I have to wait 4 weeks for turnaround.","rating":5},{"comment":"The quality of the videos the camera takes are stunning and almost vibration free.

Of course you have to be careful and sensible, but as long as you are, you'll have a wonderful experience. It can be tricky both learning to fly the drone AND learning to work the camera at the same time, so I'd recommend focusing on just the flying part until you gain some skill.

It is a VERY FAST connection and well worth the price.  I upgraded an XP home computer with a Gigabyte motherboard.  There are two hardware requirements to install this card.  You computer must have the PCI-e slot on the motherboard that can accept this card.  And you need to plug in a power plug from the PSU -The old molex type.  It has both 5v and 12v.  There is nothing more to the hardware installation. Once you boot up Windows the \"found new hardware\" wizard will automatically start but it will not be able to install the drivers from anything automatically (trust me, I tried.)  The little CD of drivers that comes with this card has the correct driver, but as everyone has noted there is no explanation on where to find it, since the CD is filled with all sorts of miscellaneous drivers.  The one I used for Windows XP Home edition SP3 was \"\\USB3.0 VL8xxDriver\\Via_XHCI_Driver_V4.00B_WithAP.exe\"  I believe it will also work for Windows 7 & 8.  This is a self-extracting installation program. Once it is installed there will be a small utility program installed which when activated, can put the card into \"Turbo\" mode @ 5 Gbps. However, I don't think you need to use this program since the USB 3.0 specs are automatically set for that speed. I tested this with my USB 3.0 WD MyBook backup external drive (without the use of the little utility.)  It was blazingly fast in transferring over my system image backups.

Then I plugged my 8&#34; tablet and smartphone (both almost empty charge) and charged up to full in matter of 2 hours. As no instruction came with the unit, it was a little confusing at first to convert from input to output mode... from charging the KMashi to out charging to the phone and tablet. Here is the trick. There is a little button next to the 4 little blue lights on the side. Tap the button quickly once to turn on to charge device mode. Push and hold the button for 1-2 seconds to turn it off.

Charging it overnight does not provide enough &#34;Juice&#34; for a whole day of operation.The Kmashi charger is larger than the iPhone and heavier, too, but it's a real powerhouse of a charger.  There are two outputs, a 1 amp one for iPhone and other low-current devices, and a 2 amp one for Kindle Fire, iPad and other devices that can use it.  You won't hurt anything if you plug a low charge-current device into the high-current outlet -- it just won't utilize all the available power.The Kmashi is charged through a micro-USB connector, and the charger outputs are both full-sized USB-A connectors.  You turn on the charger by pressing a recessed button.  It charges my iPhone from dead to full in a couple of hours - the same as any other iiPhone charger.

Previously I have good experiences with several KMASHI products (such as theKMAX-812 4400mAh Rechargeable Backup Battery Pack). That's why I decided to give this unit a try.[Battery Capacity]Most lesser-known battery packs tend to exaggerate their capacity ratings. So I conducted my own test to verify the claim of '10,000mAh'. I connected a 3.3 ohm power resistor to the 'OUT2' port (which is rated up to 2.1A max). The unit is able to supply 1.5A at 5V for 241 minutes, before shutdown. This means a total output energy of 30Wh (5V * 1.5A * 4hr). Assuming conversion efficiency of 80%, I can then estimate the internal battery to be about 10,000mAh (3.7V * 10Ah * 0.80 = ~30Wh). So the advertised capacity rating is accurate.[Output Current]During my testing, I discovered that OUT2 port is unable to sustain any load current greater than 1.8A, even though it is rated as '2.1A max'. The OUT1 port, on the other hand, is able to supply 1.1A, or slight higher than the rated '1.0A max'. This is disappointing since my main goal is to recharge myBarnes & Noble NOOK HD+ Tabletduring long trips. The Nook has problems with most power banks I tested. It will try to draw 2A charging current initially. But if it can't, it will drop the current to 0.45A instead. In this case, the Nook can draw 1.1A from OUT1, but only 0.45A from OUT2.[Status Light]The MP816 has a 4-LED battery status indicator light. According to the instruction sheet, each LED is supposed to represent 25% of charge. My actual testing showed that the status light is highly non-linear:4 LED = 61 to 100%3 LED = 32 to 60%2 LED = 19 to 31%1 LED = 4 to 18%blinking = under 3%This is a common problem with most power bank units: you can't reliably tell the remaining battery capacity based on status lights. One exception I found is thePNY Dual-Port 2.4 Amp 7800mAh PowerPack. It has a digital status indicator that can report the battery status accurately - down to 1% according to my test. Sadly, the PNY unit is also unable to supply 2A for my Nook.[Power Button]One quirky thing I noticed about the power button: it needs a very short press to turn on. If I press and hold it for 1 sec, the power remains off. This behavior is opposite to that of most other power banks.[Recharge Time]During recharge, the MP816 draws up to 1.5A - as long as your USB power source can supply it. So it takes about 8 hours to fully recharge the internal 10Ah battery pack. But if your USB power source can only supply 0.5A, then it could take 20 hours! One drawback I discovered is that there is no pass-thru charging. That means while you are charging the internal battery of the MP816, you are unable to recharge anything else from OUT1 or OUT2 ports.[Bottom Line]Given its low cost and high capacity, I still consider this KMASHI unit a very good value. I just have to remember that the '1A' port actually charges my Nook faster than the '2.1A' port.[Footnote]I used thePortaPow USB Power Monitorto measure the unit's input and output currents. It is indispensible in testing charging rate of my USB devices.

I bought this when it had just 1 review. The problem with that particular review is that it seems to be from someone from the seller or the manufacturer, considering a bulk of his reviews are of Kmashi products and all rated 5 stars. So I took a leap of faith as the price was very reasonable, and I could always return it to Amazon.This is a keeper. I am not sure about the mAH rating, since I have no way to actually test it. I suspect it may be exaggerated. However I will tell you what my findings as an user are, and you can judge for yourself if this fit your needs.The battery pack has a little heft to it. That is expected considering the size of the battery. Very well built, it feels solid and belies the price I actually paid. Quality feel. It can slip into your jeans pocket, but will make it's presence felt.--- Getting this juiced up.It takes over 14 hours with a 5V 1amp power source.It takes a little over 7 hours with a 5V 2.1amp power source.This does not come with power adapter. It only has a USB to Micro USB cable.--- Charging devicesCharging iPhone 5.Once the battery pack was fully charged, I could get 5 full charges with some juice to spare. I got the charge to 100% from the following phone battery charge state.Twice from 20%Twice from 15%Once from 10%Since these charges happened over a week without having to recharge the battery pack, it tells me that this product can be used with confidence, during travel.Charging the iPad 2This was a bit of a let down. But probably technically ok. I could only get partial charges from a full charge of the battery pack.Once from empty to 86%Once from 15% to 93%So a full charge of the battery pack will not charge the ipad to 100%, if the ipad charge is below 20% or so. But my iPad is over 2 years old and the battery may not be as efficient.My tests above should give you a fair idea as to what to expect in real world usage. I do not have other devices to test out.But based on the findings above, you could do some math and find out how this would serve your device based on your particular  devices battery capacity.I had to knock off one star because of two issues :1) This will not charge any device while the pack itself is getting recharged. There are other battery packs which do that. However it was not a deal breaker for my needs, but would have been nice.2) The charger needs a little kick in the pants, to charge upto 100%. For some reason my  iPhone would stop getting charged at around 96%. I had to press the power button on the device once again to get the charge to 100%. It may be a particular quirk with my device.","rating":4},{"comment":"This case is perfect for my smaller Galaxy Tab3.

Well it turned out it had ZERO. For some reason there is still composite video and analog audio. Why are manufacturers clinging to composite video inputs but were so quick to discard the component video? Are there still a lot of VCR and old school camcorder users? Perhaps.Well anyways, my TV had a VGA input that I had noticed when mounting it on the wall. I figured down the road I would buy an adapter and hook up my Wii to that. After reading the reviews I got a little scared. Seems that the TV must use the VGA as a component input to work. I was not sure if mine would but I bought it anyway. First I attempted using this on my Samsung LCD upstairs and it did not work at all. Gave no signal message. Hooked up my computer to the VGA and confirmed it worked. Then through all settings to determine whether it needed to be adjusted to accept component. Since that TV had component input already. it had no reason to accept component via VGA.Downstairs I removed the TV from the wall and after plugging in this adapter I noticed on the back of the TV it said &#34;VGA\/Component in&#34; My confidence rose and sure enough it worked fine. The TV I am using this on is a bargain basement Westinghouse LED from best buy.So yes. If the TV says VGA\/Component it will work. But if it simply says, &#34;PC in&#34; it may not work.

This little adapter worked well for me so here's the specifics of my system.  Hopefully you can use this as a gage to see if it will work for you:Console: Wii with Nintendo's Component Video CableOfficial Wii Component Video CableMonitor: Asus MT276 MonitorASUS MT276HE - 27\" Wide LCD Monitors - BlackConnect this adapter to the RBG plugs on your component cable.  Connect your audio as well using a separate L\/R audio cable.  Connect the VGA plug to your monitor and select VGA mode.  The monitor show allows for 2 HDMI inputs and 1 VGA input.  Turn on the Wii and your done.  The colors look pretty rich on this ASUS monitor as it allows for color adjustment.  I'd encourage you to check the specs of the monitor to make sure yours is similar.  I think the KEY ingredient is the VGA input.  By offering this connection, the adapter does not need to \"convert\" anything and just passes the signal through to the monitor via the HD15 (VGA) connector.For the price, this can't be beat and performs exactly as I hoped it would. (slight leap of faith on my part)","rating":5},{"comment":"I gave my Olevia 32\" TV to my parents, a drawback of the machine is that it has one of each port, meaning only one HDMI, one component, one composite, one s video, etc. The cable box with HD doesnt go through the TV's coaxial, but through the component, while the blu ray is on the HDMI, leaving no hi def port for the 360 I gave my father to stream video from his computer with, which had previously been running on composite.The television supports Component through the VGA port without a converter, so I grabbed a couple of these, and now the xbox 360 is displaying beautifully at 1080i (or so the xbox says it's ouputting in) through the VGA port. This means I dont have to clutter the place with a switchbox, or pay upwards of 40 bucks for the hard-to-find official x box 360 VGA cables, and my father gets a better image when using the machine to stream video.You have to make sure your TV can accept component throught the VGA though, since not all TVs are capable.","rating":5},{"comment":"I hoped to connect Wii to computer monitor.

This is not my first, or even second or third tablet.  I have been carrying one for circa 10 years, starting with theNokia 770 Internet Tablet PC.  I spent much time and energy last year looking for a suitable replacement for myArchos 70b Internet 7-Inch Tablet (8GB)when the battery died (unfortunately it needs to be shipped to France for service, which is the only issue I have with Archos). I have been carrying their tablets for a long time, and am still in love with my Archos 5\/500.  I have aKindle Fire HD 7\", HD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB - Includes Special Offersand aASUS TF700T-B1-GR 10.1-Inch Tablet (Gray) 2012 Modelas well as anArchos 101 G9 8GB - Classicwhich was purchased as a family tablet for watching videos (and entertaining kids) during travel.  It could be argued that I have enough tablets, but it was a matter of finding one which was just right for day to day use.  I find the 7 inch screen on the kindle too small for me to read comfortably and a 10 inch tablet feels like a brick in my purse.  I went in pursuit of an 8 inch tablet, but also a bit too late as Amazon had sold out of the Archos 80 titanium (which looks to be practically unobtainable at this point).  I tried theLenovo Yoga Tablet 8 - 16gb,ASUS MeMO Pad FHD 10 ME302C-A1-BL 10.1-Inch 16GB Tablet (Blue), andNOOK HD+ 9\" 32GB Tabletand found them all wanting in some way, ultimately settling on the Transformer, which does give me everything I want, but is a bit larger than what I want to carry. Many of the tech and benchmarking sites I looked to for in depth reviews said to hold off and wait for the Bay Trail processor, and, here it is.The Asus Memo does not in any way feel or behave like a budget tablet.  It is equipped with the newly released Intel Bay trail 1.3 Ghz quad core processor, a fast, efficient and cool processor optimized for mobile devices, and Intel HD integrated graphics coprocessor.  It loads just about as fast as the Kindle HDX , no mean feat, as Amazon equipped the hdx with the fastest processor available.  It also has a  high-res WXGA IPS screen with 10 point touch. (I nixed more than 1 tablet for sub-optimal display).The sound is really nice for a tablet, though as with any other, better sound can be achieved with headphones.  Because of the fast processor, streaming music on Amazon prime was a joy, so much so that it delayed my installing apps and updating the systems files ;)It is beautifully thin and light with edge to edge glass, virtually no bezel.  Unlike the prior generation, this does not look or feel like a budget tablet, and does not feel like a brick in my purse :)  It is just about the ideal size, a nice balance of size to weight ratio.  I do not feel like I am making any trade-offs carrying it.The tablet includes front and rear cameras and records HD video as well.  The 5 mp rear camera is among the best available on mobile devices.Asus's android skin is clean, not loaded with bloatware and gives you a good deal of control.  It is nicely designed and intuitive.  If you have used an android device before you should not have any difficulty learning to use or customizing this tablet.One of the benefits I have found of purchasing a tablet from an electronics company is open access.  You can download apps from Amazon, Google, or any other marketplace you choose.  If I have any issue with this tablet at all it is how closely bound to Google it is.  They ask you to input your Google account or register for one on start-up, and Google keeps trying to grab control.  I have real issues with Google's intrusions on privacy, and choose to keep them off my devices. One of the first things I did was to install Amazon's app store (which you can do without going through Google by going to amazon.com\/getappstore).The next thing I did was to installKaspersky Lab Security for Android (2-User)which I would recommend as the best all around protection I have found yet.In sum:5 stars for speed\/ processor : Intel Bay Trail with Intel HD graphics5 stars for design\/ build: and ultra thin tablet with edge to edge glass, quality look and feel5 stars for display: WXGA IPS display with 10 point touch5 stars for sound: about the best sounding tablet I have tried, even using the speakers!4 stars for android skin: Asus has nice clean android skin which gives you plenty of control.  I gave it 4 stars because you do not get quite as much control as with Archos (which is wide-open)5 stars for access: You can choose to download from virtually any android marketplace5 Stars for value: a beautifully designed, full-featured tablet at a budget price.There is not much not to like in this tablet.  Although it comes in at the high end of the budget range, it gives you quite a lot for the money.  I do not believe you can get a better 8 inch tablet for this price at the current time, and I know, I've looked (and looked)._______________Updating to add a link to theAmazonBasics 8-Inch Tablet Sleeve, a trim lightweight neoprene sleeve, which offers shock protection and some water resistance without adding weight or bulk, at a very attractive price.  It fits this tablet perfectly!  It is not flashy or a fashion accessory, but if you are looking for moderate  protection without added weight, bulk, or much expense, this sleeve does the job.-------------------------------7\/12\/2014 update------------------------------------------------I am updating this review to add some information on processor performance\/ comparisons.  Not long after I got this I was told that my daughter somehow blew up her desktop and laptop and tablet at roughly the same time (Ok, maybe didn't blow up, but they are not working).  She is a pretty  sophisticated and demanding user, having done IT support for her (engineering) college for a couple of years, so if I buy her something suboptimal she will be back on the hunt almost immediately ;)I was surprised (and impressed) to see that the Bay trail processor outperforms the tegra 3 (on the Asus transformer infinity 2013) and matches the performance of the tegra 4 (trnsformer infinity 2014).  It also outperformed all the ARM processors (most of what is on the market) and topped the lexus 7 and Nvidia shild, being topped on speed only by the intel core i3,5,7, seldom found on mobile devices.It looks like I am comparing this only to the ASUS Tranformer book ASUS Transformer Book T100TA-C1-GR(S) 10.1\" Detachable 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop, 64GB (Grey) and ASUS Transformer Pad TF103C-A1-Bundle 10.1-Inch Tablet with Keyboard Bundle (Black) which is essentially this tablet with a 10\" display and keyboard dock, or to a full sized laptop.If you are trying to decide between these models, the Transformer book is a windows 8 (or 8.1) machine, while the Transformer pad is android (and almost identical to this tablet but for the size and dock).If you need the ports, get the one with the dock.  It has other benefits as well, being a charging station and extending battery life, as well as providing a physical keyboard (though a bluetooth keyboard can be used with the tablet as well).Well done indeed!This is a lot of performance for the money, and it looks like I will be buying 2 more in short order (for both of my kids) as little brother is bound to point out that all he has is the ipad provided by his school (and I did kind of promise him one as I waxed poetic about the performance of this little tablet ;)---------------------------------------7\/20\/2014 update---------------------------------------I am updating my review again to note that I while playing with the settings discovered that it is possible to disable pre-installed apps!  This gives you a good deal of control over your device (more than most currently offer) and helps extend battery life a good deal. (Most if not all Google apps run in the background eating up memory).For me it makes an enormous difference because as a psychologist I have to safeguard contact and calender information. My solution up to this point has been to carry a separate tablet which I keep offline.  It looks like it might be possible for me to disable the apps which threaten the privacy of my clients, potentially enabling me to use one tablet instead of 2.  For me, this is a boon, as I purchased several tablets in the past year looking for a solution, one which would enable me to store contact and calender information securely.  Because Google apps pick up that information I have not been able to use my tablets as I have in the past without keeping them offline.  It looks like I might be able to do that with this tablet.  I am liking it more every day!","rating":5},{"comment":"I already have a Google Nexus 7 (2013) which is also made by ASUS but with different specs (more memory, different CPU) so my experience is colored by the comparison.First off, ASUS has customized the UI significantly (not forked, just customized). It actually looks nice and I've got to say the keyboard is a lot better if only because they've fit a lot more characters and options\/punctuation on the first board without having to switch to alternates. Definitely loved that.Since it's 4.4, the rest of the OS is largely the same and runs the same as my Nexus 7 (which I upgraded to 4.4 from 4.3). However, except for ASUS-specific apps--the browser, mail and other core apps were defaulted to ASUS versions though you can always use the Google ones--there was a noticeable amount of lag at points using different apps. For instance, I was playing Hay Day (don't judge me!) and app switching would lag several seconds at times. Other apps would often feel this way as well. My guess is it's the lower RAM (1 versus 2) but it bothered me. I understand this device is cheaper--especially since my Nexus 7 is a 7\" and the comparable MeMO Pad is $150 so the price difference is fairly substantial. Bear in mind, though, the MeMO Pad's CPU is more powerful from what little research I've done (I'm not an expert here). I never ran into this sort of hiccup on the Nexus 7. It's possible a little further down the line, the CPU differences might become more obvious but I didn't notice it.I do have to call out the included battery management app ASUS included. I'm using a third-party one on my Nexus 7 and it can make...interesting choices. The ASUS one seemed a lot smarter about power management. Honestly, if I could buy that app and run it on my Nexus 7, I think I would.Also, speaking of games, a problem that seems to exist in both devices is heat. One corner can get blazing hot, likely the CPU getting a workout. Not exactly a negative (you're getting a very slim device with a solid CPU) but at times I worry the device is gonna catch fire or something.Beyond the above, the device is otherwise pretty solid. I can't say it blew me away or anything but that's why I mentioned the Nexus 7. Technically I got a chance to be blown away when I got the Nexus 7. This just tells me ASUS can still build good devices. I'm just not sure about the software. I get that they're trying to get the device to stand out but I'd rather they just threw in that modified keyboard and left the rest of the apps to Google and other providers.Should you get this device? It really depends on what you're looking for in a device. You're saving a decent amount of money versus the Nexus 7 which can be important. It's running on 4.4 so you can use the same apps and that keyboard is great for me. You're getting a larger screen which is nice as well (there is a 7\" MeMO Pad that's $50 less so bear that in mind as well). Personally, having used the two devices, I find myself slanting towards the Nexus 7. The additional memory\/smoother experience combined with a slightly thinner form factor satisfy me more. Plus, I prefer the \"default\" Android style over the ASUS \"flat\" style, as nice as it is. If performance matters to you, you may want to try the Google Nexus 7. But, if you want the larger screen (and expanded keyboard) along with the better CPU while saving some money versus the Nexus 7, you really can't go wrong with this device.","rating":4},{"comment":"I recently bought a Nexus 7 and iPad mini for a new job and use them heavily on a daily basis. I also have a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 for personal use.  So when the opportunity came up to test this new Asus MeMo Pad 8, I was excited to test it alongside my other tablets.The MeMo's footprint falls somewhere between the iPad mini and Nexus. It's actually closest to the iPad mini, however it has an HD display, while the iPad does not; so there's really only a slight size variance between the two. The MeMo is very thin and light. I'd say the weight feels is about on par with my Nexus 7 with only a slight difference.  I used to think my HDX was super thin and light; and it is, however compared to my Nexus, and now this Memo, my HDX soon felt bulky and heavy by comparison. I do love the larger screen on my HDX, though these smaller footprint screens are starting to really grow on me.  I think this MeMo may offer the best of all words though, since it falls squarely in between all competitors as far as size and weight.  My iPad mini, by contrast (covers the iPad's ears so as not to hurt its feelings) feels more like an obese, outdated clunker compared to my other 3 tablets. Don't get me wrong, I love my iPad mini too, just not as much as my other children. (there, I said it!)Under the hood, this MeMo is almost as good as my Nexus. Both feature quad core processors but MeMo only has 1gb of RAM compared to Nexus' 2gb. Also, Nexus has a much richer display with better resolutions, but MeMo comes close.  Both Nexus and MeMo are made by Asus, and it almost seems like MeMo is their answer to their own creation, only this time, without the flagship Nexus name.Price wise, Nexus and MeMo are also very close. I paid just over 220 for a 32gb Nexus and this MeMo seems poised to start out at 200 for 16gb, which is comparable to the 16gb Nexus price. However, I feel confident MeMo's price will drop slightly after the initial launch. Personally, I think it's worth a few extra bucks to double your disk space and get the Nexus, but MeMo does have an SD slot, so it is expandable, while Nexus is not.Here's some basic comparison specs between the 2 Asus models:MeMo 8 = 0.7lbs \/ 320gNexus 7 = 0.64lbs \/ 290gMeMo 8 = Intel Atom Quad Core 1.33ghzNexus 7 = Snapdragon Quad Core 1.5ghzMeMo 8 = Intel HD GraphicsNexus 7 = Adreno 320, 400MHzMeMo 8 = 1gb RAMNexus 7 = 2gb RAMMeMo = 5mp front 2mp rear camerasNexus = 5mp front 2mp rear camerasMeMo 8 = WXGA 1280x800 IPS display 400 nitsNexus 7 = 1920x1200 HD IPS display 323 ppi; Scratch resistant Corning glassMeMo 8 = 211. 7x 124.9 x 8.3mmNexus 7 = 114 x 200 x 8.65 mmMeMo 8 microSD Slot = YesNexus 7 microSD Slot = NoMeMo 8 = Ships with KitKat Android 4.4Nexus 7 = ships with Jelly Bean Android 4.3 with a 4.4 upgrade available for downloadSo you can see how both tablets are very close in specs. Personally, using both side by side, I clearly have to give the edge to Nexus. The speed and performance is just all around better. Plus the slightly smaller footprint just works better for me.  However, the MeMo is a close second and I think the power and volume buttons, though similar to Nexux, somehow are more convenient to use.Both MeMo and Nexus have excellent cameras. but MeMo adds a nifty auto selfie and time rewind feature.  Time rewind basically shoots live video while you're taking pictures and lets you rewind frame by frame to get the exact still shot wanted from any given moment being photographed.  Cool and it works well.MeMo adds a host of free premium content that may or may not be of interest to anyone. Plus MeMo gives 500gb of free Asus cloud storage for 2 years; after which, subscription fees apply. Most of the freebies are nothing I want, but it's a nice add on all the same.Browsing and performance are really good; web pages loaded fast and app downloads went smoothly (unlike iPad which downloads and installs at a crawl by comparison.) Wifi has an excellent range and I had no connection issues. The screen is very responsive and displays beautifully.  All functions well and I have no real complaints.Bottom Line - MeMo is a solid competitor to Kindle Fire HDX and a close second to the Nexus 7. iPad mini, on the other hand, is solidly left in the dust by all of the tablets I personally own. Remember, I have all 4 in hand, so I have tried them all head to head.  By far, iPad mini is in last place, and costs the most.  First place, without a doubt, is Nexus 7. MeMo and HDX will just have to duke it out among themselves to win your heart and dollars. Personally, I'm glad I have all of them for different reasons. However, if I had to pick just one, it would definitely be Nexus 7. But MeMo is still a 5 star tablet.  Very nicely done; but then, you really can't go wrong with Asus. They have quickly become my new favorite brand. I've been a fan since the motherboard days and they continue to impress me with innovation and quality gizmos. This is a great tablet. Just decide what's most important to you and go with that.  Remember, MeMo is the only one with a microSD slot, so if that matters to you, this is your winner.UPDATE 6\/22\/14Additional Info:Speakers - they're actually quite good. I'd say the quality is better than Nexus 7 but not as good as Fire HDX.Performance - the slower CPU shows its limits on some graphic intensive games.  Nexus 7 renders everything smoothly, while MeMo has some stutters and hiccups. Nothing serious, but if you're a gamer this might be an issue.Cosmetic - MeMo feels really nice in the hand. It has a rubbery sorta backing, reminiscent to my old Toshiba Thrive. iPad mini feels awful in the hand without a case; slick and clinical, begging to be covered by a decent case. MeMo 8 will also ultimately go in a smart case too (when something decent comes available) but it also feels quite good in the hand as is. However, the tablet is in need of a case to help prop it up while in use.Buttons - the volume and power buttons are reversed from Nexus. This feels a little counterintuitive as it places the volume on the far left, and the power just to the right of that. I guess I don't power off my tablets very often though, so maybe this will prove to be the best placement over time; but for now, it feels a bit odd. The size and shape of the buttons are better than Nexus. MeMo's are a little larger and easier to press.Screen Capture - if you don't know already, to capture a screenshot of whatever is on your tablet's screen, just press the volume down and power buttons at the same time. Captures are automatically saved to your device and can even be automatically uploaded to Dropbox if you have the app. Given the button placement, screenshots are a little easier on MeMo than Nexus.  However, Fire HDX has the best button placement and functionality IMO.Camera Placement - Fire HDX has the best camera placement and integration with their Origami case (best tablet case ever BTW) Both Nexus 7 and MeMo 8 have placed the front camera on the left center of the frame, which means your thumb will easily get in the way and cause smudges on the lens. The rear cameras on both are located on the upper right back (basically opposite the front camera, but on the top corner) Again, Fire HDX has the best camera placement and function.No Flash - MeMo 8 and Nexus 7 both lack a camera flash.Color Scheme - MeMo 8 is very pleasing to the eye. The menus are inviting and easy to see. It is actually very similar to iPad's menu design, however the fonts are larger easier to read on MeMo 8. (even setting iPad's font to Large did not help much in this area.)Bloatware - Asus includes a lot of extra apps and stuff on MeMo that were not included on Nexus 7. Some of it is useful, but some isn't.  And it doesn't appear these redundant apps can be disabled, which could be a problem down the road if disk space becomes an issue.Quick Setting Menu - like most tablets, just slide your finger down from the top right of the screen to reveal the Quick Setting menu. MeMo's is laid out quite nicely with a host of colorful and inviting icons to choose from. Easy tweaks that you'll use most often, all right there.Fingerprints - Fire HDX seems to be impervious to collecting smudges fingerprints on the screen. MeMo 8, on the other hand, seems to attract them much easier than both HDX and Nexus.  Its not terribly bad, but definitely an issue.  A screen protector may be in order.That's all for now.","rating":5},{"comment":"I am married to a dedicated Dell user, but do not share his enthusiasm for their products or customer service. Since I'd never used ASUS products, I was a bit concerned about ease of use. As it turns out, I had no reason to be concerned.I am not a techie and all the tech specifications mean nothing to me. I want products that work well, are easy and fun to use, and are reliable. So far, so very, very good.I tested this tablet in less than ideal conditions, on an 8-day trip, staying in three hotels. It made an excellent impression when I found I could take it out of the box and use it. I did not open the manual and I found set-up to be truly intuitive. Although not all my WiFi connections have been reliable, this tablet has been.Having to go through ongoing hassles with a Dell tablet, I wasn't sure I even wanted to try another, but I am having fun with it and find that it satisfies my tablet needs. I would've given 5 stars, but the top of the case has a small crack in it although I've never dropped the tablet. Based on my experience so far, I would highly recommend the ASUS tablet, especially to casual users.","rating":4},{"comment":"I was looking forward to to getting the new Asus Memo Pad 8.  I have the Samsung Tab 4 8.0, the Samsung Tab Pro 8.4, the Nexus 7 2013 and the Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 and was curious about trying the Asus after reading reviews.  After trying it for awhile I am disappointed in it.  It is a budget tablet that has many fine qualities, but there are a few things I just didn'the like about it.  First of all the battery life is terrible.  It didn't last for more than 4-5 hours which is just not what I expected.  Secondly, the power button and volume rocker are placed awkwardly on the right side and they are slanted downward which makes them hard to access.  The power button is placed below the volume rocker so I was fumbling around for it, hard to feel for it.  Next is the display, I found it to be a little too dark and a bit dull.  Initial set up was very easy except the tablet has to be charged for a full 8 hours before it can be used.  I also feel that it is a bit heavy, after using it for awhile my arm and hand started to cramp.  Otherwise it is a very nice tablet particularly for anyone looking for a budget tablet.  I really thought I would like it, but because of the not so good battery life I decided against it.  The build quality is good, it fits nicely in the hand.  It is is fast and smooth.  Lots of very nice features that will appeal to most for the price.  I will stick to the Samsung, Kindle Fire HDX, and Nexus!  Will hesitantly recommend.","rating":4},{"comment":"In the literal sea of tablet offerings in the 7 to 8 inch class, it takes a lot to impress and it appears Asus is trying its level best to do so.  The real question is, have they succeeded?Boasting an Intel quad core Atom processor and a high resolution screen playing the newest Android 4.4 OS, it appears Asus is attempting to stand out in the $200 crowd.But can they succeed?  Previous MeMO versions sold at the big box stores did okay but were nothing spectacular and the tablet field is inundated with offerings that cost less (or more) so the competition is tough and standing out is even tougher.  Making matters worse for this field is the Apple iPad Mini which comes in with a higher price but a larger cache.For starters, this does pack the Intel processor and the newer OS, but Asus adding their own OS overlay called ZenUI, a design in which the start screen packs a lot of information that you can personalize; however, to be truthful there is only so much you can pack into such small real estate.The Asus also has a screen resolution normally found on larger screen units which does result in bright colors, vivid pics and non-stuttering videos plus you get the ubiquitous dual cameras, front and rear, but so does just about everybody else.Unfortunately, in an attempt to lengthen battery life, Asus took the low road and set screen brightness so low that even at maximum you're still pretty dim.  Readable, but still a bit dim.As for aesthetic qualities, they could best be described as minimalistic.  If nothing else, it's a flush, compact unit with nary a protrusion anywhere.  Buttons are flush mounted yet easily located and the rear surface is dimpled and easy to grasp and the only noticeable bumps on the front consist of the outside case border around the glass.  Otherwise it's smooth sailing, literally.Note to manufacturers -- it's nice to offer tablets in wild or sedate colors, but don't make an issue about it -- 99% of us are going to bury these in protective cases and only superheroes with x-ray vision will ever notice.In my testing I did find overall operations to be snappy and downright quick.  Battery life was a reasonable 7 to 8 hours which is about 1 hour shy of stated ratings.  In my experience this is about standard with manufacturer specs being about 1 hour off real world testing.  Video fluttering was nearly non-existent and apps flew open nearly as quickly as I could tap the icons.What probably helps the most here is the inclusion of Android 4.4, aka, Kit Kat (considering the logo is the Android robot made to look like the candy bar, one can only wonder what Google had to pay for those rights), the newest and fastest incantation in the Android line.  It adds tweaks and gizmos galore that will keep the average geek occupied for a while.And this is where the Asus outshines the Apple Mini -- the OS.  While iOS is a worthy competitor it lacks on-screen interactivity and widgets, in general.  Android has design and spark with vivid interactivity and the high resolution screen of the Asus helps a lot (although detractors state its overall specs are light, they fail to realize this is small package delivering the screen quality of a larger notebook).So, does the MeMO have any faults?  There are a few but they are relatively minor:* Who thought of moving the camera to the right edge from the center mounted variety found on earlier models?  This means users may get hands or fingers in the way (especially in landscape mode) and all older cases will no longer work even though the unit may fit.* Music and sound reproduction, although highly touted by Asus, is acceptable but not outstanding.  As one would expect, much better with headphones but as a standalone the sound is barely passable (and made worse by adding a case).* Screen brightness is limited and possibly too much so.  Even turning off the battery saving features didn't make the screen too much brighter.So, is the Asus a good buy?  In the $200 category, most definitely so.  Sure beats the competition in most respects and going any lower in price is a sure bet on disappointment.","rating":4},{"comment":"When it has came down to tablets, they have definitely shown to be the next best thing to computers and smartphones. But overall, it has been very hard to find what is the best tablets on the market not just in price, but value as well. Asus has made some excellent computers and tablets over the past several years. While they have been overlooked from being taken seriously into the touch screen handhelds, in favor of Apple with the Ipad and Ipod Touch. Asus, which had made the Google Nexus 7 tablet and the Memo Pad HD 7 tablet, which were very heavily overlooked, but made some excellent progress. The new Memo Pad 8 ME is a lightweight tablet has expandable memory and works flawlessly, where you can listen to your music, download apps from the Amazon Appstore without hassles and has a very elegant interface. It works very well, and works in sync with my micro SD Card, and has a fast processor. If you are looking for a great alternative to the Apple Ipad, I absolutely recommend this tablet for the money.Price: B+Speed & Reliability: B+Convience: A-Battery Life: BOverall: B 1\/2+","rating":4},{"comment":"Update 7\/14\/14: I reset the tablet and in the install process I turned OFF background updates (it's a checkbox in the install process). Then I went into settings>accounts>google and used the menu dropdown to re-enable sync. Why did this work? I don't know but instead of draining 100% overnight it now drains about 2-3% a day when in standby.I really like this tablet. It is the right size to carry when i have a case or a backpack and I want something lighter than a full-sized tablet but larger than a phone.Because size matters a lot in this case here are the exact measurements:The viewable screen, 4 and 1\/4 inches wide by 3 and 3\/4 inches long. The actual tablet itself is 5 inches wide and 8 and 5\/16ths inches long.the thickness is 5\/16ths of an inch. I don't have a triple bean balance to weigh it but it's very light and can easily be held for an extended period in one hand. It comes with Android 4.4.2, bluetooth and wi-fi. it has a 5 MP camera on the back and 2MP on the front.  If you already have used android there aren't any big surprises here. Asus adds a significant amount of bloatware that you can't remove, though you can deactivate it by going to settings>app>click the app>disable.The hardware itself is responsive and can handle videos well as well as light gaming. The screen is a pleasure to look at and doesn't have the extremely annoying \"auto adjust\" brightness feature that other Asus tablets have. There is only 16 GB of internal memory and after installing my favorite apps I'm already down to 10.4GB so it goes fast. You won't be able to store a lot of video on this device without adding an SD card (which isn't a big dead as a 32 GB SD card is quite cheap now).So if it is such a nice little device why only three stars?  Two words, battery life. One of the first things I noticed about this device is that it was draining almost all of the battery overnight. When I checked the battery usage chart it was almost all because the wifi was remaining active all night. Fine, I went into the power settings and set the wifi to turn off when the tablet is idle. It didn't help, the battery was still being drained by wifi overnight. So I tried again with the battery settings, this time using \"ultra-saving mode\" which says specifically \"disconnects the network when the device is suspended\". yet still the battery was being drained overnight by the wifi.So the only solution to this is to remember to manually turn off wifi before I set the device down. If i don't do that the wifi will eat up all the battery to the point when the unit won't even power on without being charged first for several minutes. One of the key selling features, as far as I'm concerned, for a tablet is power management. You should not need to constantly remember to plug the device in. In fact, i have an eee pad slider that can literally go for weeks on a single charge if I don't use it much. No such luck with this tablet which will drain its battery in about 2-3 days EVEN IF i turn off the wifi and put the unit in standby mode. That's just poor power management. if you've chosen the \"ultra-saving\" battery mode the tablet ought to be able to last many days without a charge if it isn't being actively used.If Asus can sort this power management issue I'd bump the device to 5 stars. By the way, this is NOT a problem in the Asus T-100 which also uses a Bay Trail processor. So I know they can get this right, perhaps a fix is on the way in a firmware push.","rating":5},{"comment":"Looks good, feels great to the touch, nice screen.

I was looking in the 7-9 inch range when I found this. At half the price of Apple's iPad and Samsung's Tab S, this device is perfect. Its biggest competitor is the Nexus 7 which is made by Asus as well. I only needed the device for watching movies and tv shows from Netflix or other sources. I wanted something without huge bezels and wasted space. The Nexus 7 has a better screen, better build quality, and runs faster, but it is smaller, has way bigger bezels and doesnt have expandable MicroSD storage. MicroSD storage will allow me to put up to 128 gigs of movies and music on this device. Asus ZenUI isnt bad, but I like plain old Kitkat better. For the money this rocks.**UPDATE**After using this device I noticed it runs super slow. If I am running an app for a while and press the home button there is a 10 second delay before my apps and widgets fully load. Im not exaggerating I used a timer. Speeding up animation speeds made the device have to illusion of running faster but it is still very laggy. Kinda disappointed. I think it is the combination of cheap internals and poor performance optimization with Asus software. I feel that stock Android might work better. Should have gone with the nexus 7.","rating":2},{"comment":"The Good:+ Highly Portable+ Good CPU Performance+ Value - Outperforms Its PriceThe Bad:- Awkward Controls- Dull\/Muted Display- BloatwareOverall:  The ASUS MeMO Pad 8 is for budget-minded users looking for a highly portable tablet.Background:  The ASUS MeMO Pad 8 is the second in the MeMO Pad line that I have reviewed (see my review of the MeMO Pad FHD 10).Design:  ASUS can&#8217;t seem to get out of their own way when it comes to design.  While the build of the MeMO Pad 8 doesn&#8217;t feel as cheap as the FHD 10, the control placement makes for a frustrating user experience.  The volume rocker and the power button are along the right side (in portrait mode), but they are at a weird angle as the edges of the tablet are slanted inward from front to back.  This makes the buttons hard to press, and I find that I am always hitting volume down when I want the power (and screen lock) button.  It is unfortunate because these are controls that users need every time they use the tablet.Setup:  As seems to be standard with ASUS tablets, it begins with an 8 hour charging cycle.  It&#8217;s not a dealbreaker, but it puts a damper on the new tablet experience.  The real setup process is smooth as it should be by this stage of Android tablet development.  Unlike all other tablets I&#8217;ve owned, this one did not have a firmware update.  You are off to the races at this stage.Display:  The resolution of the MeMO Pad 8 is 1280 x 800 which is typical of 7&#8221;\/8&#8221; tablets - the noted exceptions are the iPad Mini w\/Retina Display and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, which have superior displays but at superior prices.  However, resolution is not what disappointed me in the MeMO Pad 8.  The display is dull and dark compared to the FHD 10.  I applied the same background wallpaper on each device, and the difference is significant.  This affects every aspect of using the tablet - other than something like music playback where you aren&#8217;t using the screen.Gaming:  While the display doesn&#8217;t yield the most fulfilling experience, the Intel processor handles intensive games without blinking.  I fired up Riptide GP2 with low expectations, but there were no hesitations or skips during play.  Other games (such as Zen Pinball) are just better on a 10-inch tablet.Portability:  This is the main appeal of the MeMO Pad 8 over the FHD 10.  It is much easier to carry - especially for people like my wife who carries her iPad mini in her purse.  In addition to being smaller, it is also lighter.  One other side benefit of the size is that thumb typing is easier than it is on 10-inch tablets.Bloatware:  It&#8217;s a way of life for Android tablets that don&#8217;t come directly from Google.  Disable the apps, and grit your teeth once at the wasted space.  As they said on Battlestar Galactica, &#8220;All of this has happened before and will happen again.&#8221;Overall:  The ASUS MeMO Pad 8 seems to have two main benefits that I&#8217;ll call the &#8220;two P&#8217;s&#8221; - portability and price.  This is a budget tablet that provides slightly better than budget performance.  If portability is not a major concern for you, I would strongly recommend that you consider the FHD 10 instead.  The current price gap is around $10, but the features and performance make this a no-brainer.","rating":4},{"comment":"I bought the Asus HD 7 inch Memo Pad Tablet last year, and chose it because it is affordable, has Jellybean which works with Bluetooth, and has an micro SD slot for expanding memory.This one has the same 16 gbs of storage, with the same 1 gb of ram and the micro SD slot for expanding memory, but has a bigger screen with good resolution. That extra inch means that I can read graphic novels easily without having to switch to panel view like I do on the older Memo Pad or my iPad mini.Photos look good, I use the rear facing camera more than the front facing one not being interested in taking selfies. It doesn't replace a good digital camera, but for taking photos of things like plated food to share on social networks, it's great. The colors are just saturated enough, and the details show well.This also sounds better than the other Memo pad, the onboard speaker has a fuller sound and gets a bit louder. It's not great sound, but enough for video. For streaming music, you might want to use a good Bluetooth speaker with it.This is lighter than the iPad mini and is very comfortable to hold. The battery has a good life, better than the iPad mini, and on par with the other (smaller) Memo pad. It charges with a standard mini USB. The Bluetooth connectivity is good, pairs quickly and works well. The wifi also works well. I can use this sitting outside my house without any issues.The one thing I didn't like about the other Memo pad is still true on this one. The screen shows fingerprints and smudges worse than any other screen I've ever seen. Use a stylus, otherwise you're going to be wiping this down every single time you use it.It's a budget tablet, but one with great features, and all the things that made me very satisfied with my purchase of the other tablet are still true with this one, but this one loads quicker, and has a much better display. The one thing that the iPad mini has over it is some functionality. There are just some apps that are still iPad only. For display, this one is the clear winner over the iPad mini.","rating":5},{"comment":"I'm really very, very pleased with this &#34;budget&#34; Android tablet.First, the form factor is very nice. It is thin with minimal side borders and a nicely &#34;grippy&#34; back. It is much like the iPad Mini, but narrower and slightly thinner.The screen is bright and the &#34;modest&#34; 1280x800 resolution is absolutely fine for this size device. In a pinch, I would use this as a reader in place of my Kindle Paperwhite.I work for a game developer and I was very curious to see how this tablet would do running our Unity-based apps that are in development (and therefore not fully performance tuned). This is where the Asus really surprised me. There were no stutters or hesitations at all. Everything ran flawlessly.I am well and truly impressed by this tablet. In fact, ignoring the different eco-systems, I actually prefer this to the iPad Mini. I also find the slightly extra space in this 8&#34; form factor is preferable to the Nexus 7 (2nd generation) that I have used as my Android device in the past","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a really nice device.  I had the MeMo Pad HD7 and really liked it but the screen was too small for my liking and my niece gladly adopted it from me.  The 8 inch is a really nice size (I wish Amazon would make their Paperwhite in this size).  It is tall and slim and easy to hold.  I need to get use to the very slim sides - I've accidentally held it and found myself turning pages when I wasn't ready, but the bottom area is wider and is a comfortable place to hold on to while reading.  It is very light - close to the IPad Mini (which I also have and love).  The screen is beautiful and I have to say that the screen colors in pictures and movies are more vibrant than the IPad mini.  The MeMo was very easy to set up and get started with.  Everything downloaded very quickly - email was easy to set up and adjusting the home page to the way I wanted it to look was very easy also.  I use my tablets mainly for reading - holding all of my Nook, Kobo and Kindle books.  Downloading my books was very easy and quick.  In using the browser for surfing I found that it was not as quick as the IPad mini and several times I was kicked off but I assume that is normal for all tablets - the mini does it also.  Wifi connection is stable and far better than the Mini which drops the connection a lot when I am in my bedroom which is two floors away from the router.  I did find that there were times that the screen was unresponsive to my touch requiring me to shut it down and bring it back up.  Also I was a little disappointed in the battery life.  I keep my screen light very low (though at the lowest setting it is still too bright for me, especially at night.  Thank goodness for the screen filter app) so I was very surprised when I went to bed and it was 97% and when I opened it up in the morning it was 73% - I'll have to keep watch on this.  The sound from the headphones is good - comparable to the Ipad mini. Pictures taken with the MeMo - in my opinion - are no better and no worse than the IPad mini.  I really, really like the back of the device.  It has a slightly rubberized feel to it - it is not slippery in your hands or on your lap and it does not show fingerprints.  Right now there are few covers out there available for the MeMo but with the non-slippery back I would be happy to keep it uncovered.  The screen is the same as the IPad mini and other tablets in that it does show your prints - I don't think there is any way to get around that.  I was happy to hear it had the SD card to increase your memory but very disappointed that when I tried to move things onto the card - it refused to accept it.  The device recognizes the card and space available but I just can't get things to move over.  Still all in all I am happy with the MeMo 8 and would definitely recommend it to someone who wants a quality looking\/well performing tablet for a low cost.  I think Asus has come a long way from the first MeMo 7 whose battery life was horrible. I hope the 8 inch size will be kept around for a long time.  Now I am interested to seeing which device I start carrying with me more (Mini or MeMo)  - that will be the final seal of approval.UPDATE:  i have lowered my rating a star after using this device further because of the battery life.  I charged the MeMo last night to be ready to take it to work.  The battery was at 100% but in the morning when I  woke it up the battery indicated 65%..  The difference between the MeMo and the  iPad mini is that the mini only discharges no more than 5% if that overnight.  I guess the solution is always to shut it down completely but I feel you shouldn't have to.  This device is  a very nice piece of equipment  and I really do like reading on it.  i just wish the battery life was more stable.  Hopefully it is just a problem with the one I received and not all.","rating":3},{"comment":"I have used an early Kindle Fire 7&#34; (rooted and upgraded to KitKat 4.4.2) for a while now. I wanted a more recent, faster device with a slightly bigger screen, that was lighter to hold.  I waited for this tablet to be released, and I'm glad I did.+++ Performance +++The speed of the device is excellent. I notice almost no lag on pretty much anything I care to run on it (although I'm not a tablet gamer).  I have a reference material app that is about 100MB in size and navigation and data retrieval from that app is snappy and without problems. Having Kitkat helps since it's the fastest android yet, but still, the quad-core processor in this tablet is quick.+++ Screen +++The display is 1280x800, looks very nice, is bright and the colors are vivid. I like the 8&#34; size because it's great for reading with a decent font size, without the bulk of a 10&#34; screen.+++ Physical feel \/ ergonomics \/ weight +++I liked the kind of rubberized back of the Kindle Fire so I wondered if I would like the back of this device as much.  I have to say that I do like it. It doesn't feel quite as solid as the Kindle but then again it's much thinner and lighter, so maybe that's why. At 0.8 pounds this thing is great to hold even for extended periods.  I am unsure about the [power\/volume] button placement and style.  The buttons are on the right side towards the top, but are located on the rounded 'corner' of the tablet between the side and the back. I guess this is so that whether you place the tablet on its side or back, the buttons won't get pressed by accident. The buttons do feel solid though.+++ OS \/ GUI feel +++I like it.  For those of you worried about whether Asus strayed too far from stock Android - don't be.  There is a mild Asus 'skin' but it looks very nice and it's easy to get to every single stock android setting that you are used to.  The quick menus that you pull down from the top are customizable and give access to pretty much everything you'd need fast access to.+++ Features +++This thing is loaded up. Latest Intel Atom quad-core CPU, GPS, Bluetooth, MicroSD card slot, front and rear cameras, it even supports Miracast to wirelessly transmit the tablet's video output to a TV or other large screen.  And of course the latest version of Android.A lot of folks will want to know more about the camera performance. To be honest I don't really use them much on my tablet, since my Galaxy S5 has better cameras. But from what I've seen, the cameras are pretty good and should do an ok job.+++ Battery Life \/ Power \/ Charging +++I have only run it through a couple of charges so far. It seems to last pretty well.  It drains quicker than my Kindle did but then again it does have 30% more screen area, and the screen is by far the biggest drain on the battery.The included charger is a 1.5 amp device. Pretty much any charger that outputs via MicroUSB seems to work.  I keep a Powergen battery pack in the car in case any of my personal electronics start to die and it charges well off that too.www.amazon.com\/PowerGen-12000mAh-External-Battery-Capacity\/dp\/B0085OB0IEI may edit this portion of my review after I've had it a month or two and seen how the battery performs.+++ Value for money +++For $199, I've never come across a tablet that's so well specified and loaded with features. For the money, I don't see how you can be disappointed. Blows the pants off an iPad mini, that's close to twice the price, and this tablet has a bigger screen.+++ Negatives +++It's hard to find any.  But if I had to gripe about something, it's the lack of an ambient light sensor.  A lot of tablets have this now, and it brightens and dims the screen automatically according to how bright it is in the room. However, the brightness slider is just one swipe away at all times (it's at the top of the right-hand menu pull-down). There's no way I could take a star off my review for this since it's is the only minor gripe I have with the device.+++ Conclusion +++If you are looking for a budget device but with the latest OS and great performance, this tablet is for you. I would recommend it without hesitation.","rating":5},{"comment":"Currently this is my favorite of the ASUS brand tablets, and I have owned five over the last few years including the ASUS MeMO Pad 7 ME176CX-A1-BK 7-Inch Tablet. Both are easy to use and sport the 1 GB of Ram, but the 8&#34; is a great size for reading on the go, be it a book or a comic. Downloading with this is quick and painless with the 1 GB of RAM making access to the internet quick with no delay, and the lack of lagging continues while streaming in videos or listening to music. The display looks good, too, adding to all forms of media, be it movies or comics. For the price, the tablet has great specs, with the aforementioned 1 GB of RAM, 16 GB of storage, an expansion slot so you can add SD cards. It has a great feel, is lightweight, and looks sharp. I also like the new design when it comes to accessing your tablet, with functionality becoming even more streamlined. If there is one downside to the newer ASUS tablets, it has to be the cameras. I do not take many pictures with tablets anyhow, but there is a graininess to the pictures it takes that leaves something to be desired. Still, that is seen in a number of tablets and is not something that really impacts my view.If you are new to tablets or do not know technology all that well, I think the ASUS models come off as very user-friendly. I purchased one for a family member who is terrified of technology and she was able to figure out a lot of functionality. Also, I want to add in something on ASUS customer support. I have had to make some service calls over the years to three different companies, and ASUS was the most recent one because of a small but annoying error. The person I spoke with was nice and very helpful, and they actually stayed with me well into an hour, answering all my questions and making certain there were no more issues. That kind of customer service combined with affordability, durability, and functionality is what keeps me with ASUS.","rating":5},{"comment":"I use this with my iPad to free up storage and to provide a back up storage system.

I picked my favorite player (I have a few installed) and the movie played great. No lag AND it even streamed the subtitles (.srt file), which normally doesn't work when streaming to devices via DNLA.8.

I've tried everything I know. I think it isn't intended for Windows computers - only Apple and Android operating systems.  So I am being overly generous by giving it three stars.  I cannot find anything useful on the Toshiba website - certainly no support.  I have tried three times and nobody knows anything at all.Toshiba made it a special effort not to provide any instructions with this product. They have lots of pictorials, but when you get down to wanting to use it, the instructions are so terse as to be absolutely useless. And how is the SD card slot supposed to work?

Because it's using WIFI, you sort of have to make a choice, which are you going to use, the internet or the device. That right there is pretty limiting. Then, the fact that I wasn't able to connect it to all my devices was disappointing. I first tried to connect it to my computer. I was able to log on to the device, but when I tried to use the web interface to access the storage, the web page wouldn't load correctly in Internet Explorer. So, then I tried connecting from my phone, a Nokia Icon. Same connection setup, no issues there. Then the web site opened right up and worked fine. So, the phone was working. Next, a Windows tablet, but it didn't work. So I was only able to get two of three devices working. However, once I was connected, I could browse to the device through File Explorer. But, I couldn't move any files into the device from there.But, you can connect it directly to a device too. I turned it off so that it was no longer set up as a wireless device. Then I plugged it into the computer. That worked fine. From there I was able to move files around, store stuff, retrieve it.Back on the phone, the web site gives you access to not just the files on the device, the ability to manipulate the device, set up users, change the WIFI configuration and other stuff along those lines. It worked just fine.One other thing that I didn't like too much about the device was the connection on the device itself. It uses a proprietary connection that goes to USB. So, if I want to care this, it's one more cable added to my bag. It would have been better if it used a mini-usb. Also, the drive itself looks like metal, but it's plastic and frankly feels a little cheap. It has a bag that it can be carried in and you'll probably need it. I suspect this won't last long on the road (but I'm flying out to Belgium with it tomorrow, so we'll see).It also has the capacity for full-sized SD cards, but I didn't have one around to test with it.Overall though, I'm a little disappointed with the device since it won't work with my tablet or PC without being plugged in. However, it's a nice addition for more storage. But if I want full control of the device, I'll have to always use my phone. That's kind of weak.","rating":2},{"comment":"I would say this device needs more improvement.It seems to work okay with my smartphone, but it has to be connected via the free app which you get from Play Store.It took me a while to learn how to use the device, but when I did, I was able to transfer my photos from my smartphone.I have yet to use it for my laptop so I cannot on that.Plus you need to turn this on with the button on top every time you use it, plus you must keep it charged for it to work, it comes with a charge adaptor, and pouch to keep it it.128 GB will hold a lot of photos, but beware if using it for music or video, as those use space more quickly, especially video.","rating":3},{"comment":"I have enjoyed the service of this device from the moment I started using it. I'm primarily using it as cloud storage for my smartphone, nexus pad, and laptop when away from home. I've not had any problems after close to a month of use. It streams movies and music without any problems, although I've noticed some buffering issues when I playback movies on my Nexus 10... I haven't noticed buffering issues with any other device, so I'm reluctant to point at the Toshiba SSD for that issue.Setup was no problem for me even though I've seen some reviews that shared a different experience. I do agree that the GUI (graphic user interface) for the software leaves much to be desired. I don't use it at all as it is all but useless... the file tree behind the GUI is where I access all my media and files. This seems to work fine.I like this little wireless SSD a lot. It holds a charge well (I've yet to run it completely down before recharging), and have seen use for over eight hours before I've plugged it in for a charge. I'm sure there are some software tweaks that might make this a better product than it is, but I'm very pleased as it is.","rating":4},{"comment":"Think of the Toshiba Canvio AeroMobile Wireless SSD as a really big SD card for your phone. But better than an SD card, because you don't have to plug it into your phone to use it: You just connect using Wi-Fi. And because the device has two Wi-Fi radios and a network bridge inside, you can still use the Internet while connected to this device. That's right, unlike what another reviewer said, you don't have to choose between using the Internet and using this device. You just connect to the Canvio, give it the information about the wireless network you want to connect to, and it takes care of the rest. This feature definitely works, I got it to work for me pretty easily.Another item of clarification is what kind of cable you use to charge it and\/or connect to your PC. Another reviewer stated it's a non-standard cable. It is not. It's a standard micro USB cable like most devices use these days. The port it plugs into has two parts to it, so it looks like a non-standard port. (I don't know what the other part of the port is for.) But the cable that comes with the Canvio is a standard micro USB cable. I was able to plug in either the cable that came with the unit, or another cable; both worked fine. And since it supports USB 3.0, data transfers via USB are very fast when using another USB 3.0-capable device.I like that you have to hold the power button down to get it to turn on, this means it's unlikely to turn on accidentally, say, in your carry-on bag, thereby draining the battery unnecessarily.About media-sharing, the positives are that it holds a lot, uses CompactFlash memory for high speed, light weight, and silent, vibrationless operation (i.e. no hard disk inside), and supports up to three different users so that, say, a family can share one device. You can even password-protect the accounts for privacy (although I'm pretty sure you can bypass this by connecting straight to the device with a USB cable.) It supports files greater than 4 GB in size since it's formatted with the NTFS file format. And you can expand the storage space available on it by plugging an SD card into the slot on the side.The Android app that goes with this device is full-featured and reasonably sized, that is, it's not bloated. But it does not support all video formats, so for example, movies that I take on the road with me have to be encoded correctly. My standard encoding scheme is H.264 in the .mkv container type  and this device doesn't know what to do with it. (&#34;Can't play this video,&#34; it says.) Since you have to use Toshiba's app to stream video, you're at their mercy for what they support. And I see the Android app hasn't been updated since April 24, so Toshiba apparently isn't working too hard on adding features, which is unfortunate.You can connect to the device using your browser instead of the Toshiba app, and it seems to work about the same. But all the same I couldn't stream a video, because both browsers I tried wanted to download them instead. The video format issue is not a big enough deal to mark it down. Basically, if you created the media on your phone, the Canvio will know what to do with it.Regarding backing up pictures and videos, it's an easy-to-find menu item on the app. You pick the user who will own the backed-up files, and watch the progress bar. Once the files are backed up, you can view them from any other device that you connect to the Canvio (as long as you know the user's password, if you set that up). You can also choose to download one picture or video at a time, just find it using the app and press the download icon. (I will confess I couldn't get this particular feature to work for me though.)I also really like the documentation. This device is fully documented via a 187-page PDF on the device and available for download from the Toshiba Web site.The Toshiba Canvio AeroMobile Wireless SSD is a great product concept and well-executed. I definitely recommend it for backing up and sharing media from your mobile devices.","rating":5},{"comment":"Transfer speeds are good with USB 3.0, great amount of space, but had too much difficulty getting the wireless to work. The instructions are very lacking. Finally gave up and now use it as an external harddrive.","rating":2},{"comment":"I don&#8217;t need to send files via WI-FI. I wanted a portable SSD drive to act like a thumb drive on steroids, where I could use it to transfer large files between computers (including one that came with an SSD internal). Plus I wanted to be able to boot from it if I needed to. So here is what I did:1. I connected the SSD drive to my Mac via its included USB cable.2. I copied all of the included files to my Mac (just in case I needed them later).3. I opened Disk Utilities and saw that it was formatted as FAT&#8230; I believe that means it was formatted for PCs  - not Macs, so I reformatted it to be Mac compatible. BTW: For you Mac people out there, there is a Mac driver in the disk image: &#8220;Tuxera NTFS for Mac.dmg&#8221;. So there is obviously a way to use the WI-FI with Macs.4. Once reformatted, I partitioned it into two partitions - one was left blank for any copying that I will need to do in the future and the other to have a Mavericks system installed. This way I can boot to it if anything happens to my Mac&#8217;s system. BTW: It boots just great. I like the speed of the SSD over my old Firewire hard drives. It just flies!I am quite please with my new SSD Drive. FYI: The wired file transfer between it and my Mac is much faster than my small thumb drive yeaaaah!!! I can highly recommend it for the two things that I use it for, but (obviously) I can&#8217;t say anything about the WI-FI capabilities.BTW: It lasted all day and evening when I was booted to it. Either the battery is super good or it takes it power from the USB cable when plugged in.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have a Samsung Note3 and thusfar the only issue was initially staying connected to the device. I am running Android 4.3 and had to turn off the setting that automatically changes WiFi to the strongest signal.

Overall a decent product and does what it promises.","rating":4},{"comment":"In concept the Toshiba Canvio AeroMobile Wireless SSD drive is a fantastic device for storing media and backing up your mobile devices, but there is definitely room for improvement.  I've been using the drive for about 3 weeks now and have had a few problems with the some of the wireless functions with the device.My main purpose for the drive is for photo storage while traveling.  My goal was to off load my photos to my laptop, then wirelessly transfer them to the AeroMobile.  From the start, I had problems connecting my Macbook Pro to the drive.  The laptop would see and connect to the device, but when I tried accessing via the web, the browser would freeze up.  I decided to use the drive connected with the USB cable only.  As a regular external drive, the drive is fast, much faster than the 3 portable external drives I currently use.  The drive is also very light which was a plus while traveling.I did try loading a few movies and some music onto the drive and was able to connect to it wirelessly with my iPad and Galaxy S3 with no problem.  Using the Toshiba app, there was some buffering while watching movies but there was no problem playing music.  I haven't tried doing a backup of the iPad or the S3 so can't comment on that feature.Overall, I'm pleased with the speed of the drive and its portability.  If it worked consistently with all my devices I would surely give it 5 stars, but for now, I'd have to give it 3.","rating":3},{"comment":"We're a major gaming household and have four desktop computers (two for gaming and two for TV\/movie\/music media centers), several tablets and multiple other phones\/wireless devices which means we store\/stream\/play A LOT of data. The majority of our current hard drives are Western Digital and range in size from 250GB to 1TB. We also began using Seagate drives (Seagate Backup Plus 2 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive STCA2000100) which have been quite pleased with. However, Toshiba has always been one of my favorite brands (my first and most beloved boombox in the 1980's was the TOSHIBA RT-SF5), therefore I was excited to test out the Toshiba Canvio AeroMobile Wireless SSD (HDTQ112XCWF1).  Here are my thoughts;Pros+ Fast data transfer speed.+ Extremely compact size and highly portable.  Perfect for travel.+ Built-in SD card slot for expanded storage.+ Full computer boot up in mere seconds.+ Can connect to up to 8 devices simultaneously.+ Compatible with PC, Mac, Android and iOS devices.+ Wireless.Cons- As with most Solid State Drives you have to sacrifice storage for performance.- A few of the Apps froze up on me from time to time.- No way to auto-connect to WiFi.  I have to manually connect through settings each use.- A bit spendy for the overall storage capacity.- Battery life seemed to fluctuate and was a little unpredictable.The \"Toshiba Canvio AeroMobile Wireless SSD (HDTQ112XCWF1)\" is the third Solid State drive we've owned.  Our other SSD's areOCZ Technology 60 GB Vertex Plus Optimized Edition SATA II 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive OCZSSD2-1VTXPL60Gwhich we've sadly had to replace three times with the manufacturer due to repeated data corruption.  I'm happy to report that I've had no such issues with this Toshiba SSD.  Overall I'm very happy with the \"Toshiba Canvio AeroMobile Wireless SSD (HDTQ112XCWF1)\" and would gladly recommend it as a portable storage drive.  If you don't mind sacrificing a bit of storage for speed then this drive would be a good investment.","rating":4},{"comment":"I can&#8217;t seem to get this to work with Windows.

Great item with great potential!&#34;  I now have mixed feelings about it.  :\/  Great concept with some flaws.  It's light, fast and very portable.  Those are great pluses.  It's wireless!  Another plus!  But there's a mixed message:  it uses WIFI so you have to decide whether you want to use the 'net or the device.  I also had issues connecting it to everything I wanted to connect it to.  I run Windows 8...I had issues.  I have a Note 3.  Issues there.  I have an iPad 3.  Success.  I continuously tried to get the computer and phone to connect but never did.  That was frustrating since my main goal was to get pictures off my phone and onto the SSD.  I almost forgot.  I tried to connect it to a Surface Pro 2.  No go (it has Windows 8 too).It can connect to your device but the storage amount is so minimal I'd rather invest in a portable hard drive.  That's just my opinion.  (Note:  you can add an SD card for additional storage.)I think I'd wait until it gets along better with more peripherals and has greater on-board storage.","rating":3},{"comment":"I noticed quite a few negative comments about this device, and was surprised.

Please continue reading to find out why.I&#8217;m one of those people who reads the manual before using a product.  The box came with all security seals intact but there was no manual or quick start guide.  I went to Toshiba.com only to learn that I needed to go to Toshibastorage.com.  After wasting the better part on an hour I, noticed a link that indicated that support for this particular model hard drive had been moved to yet a different website.  I gave up on getting a manual for the time being.I had trouble plugging the hard drive into its power adapter because the data cable is only a foot long.  Short cables are a pet peeve of mine.  Really, couldn't they spare at least two more feet?  My power strip is on the floor under my desk.  That forced me to leave the hard drive on the floor, where it was a prime target for being crushed.Upon plugging in the hard drive into its power adapter, a green light started blinking.  I assumed that meant it was charging.  I left the drive charging overnight.  The next morning none of the drive&#8217;s indicator lights were on.  I pressed the power button and nothing happened.  I tried the power button a few more times, and still nothing happened.I reconnected the drive to its power adapter and once again, a green-light started blinking.  I left the drive charging (hopefully?) for several hours.  In the meantime, I went to the 3rd website where I was finally able to download the manual.  A blinking green light means it is charging, so the hard drive should have charged; but it didn&#8217;t.Several hours later I tried using the drive by plugging it into my computer.  I have a Windows 7, 64-bit computer and I had no trouble accessing the hard drive.  The drive comes with several folders and files on it already.  There are multiple folders for different users, so content can be easily organized.  There are also files and how-to guides pertaining how to use the hard drive with a Mac computer.  For some reason, they did not include a manual for the hard drive, which would have been nice.  That would have saved me all the time I wasted on the Toshiba websites.I give credit where it is due and this drive is fast!  I transferred a video file that was 1.8GB in less than two minutes!  Now that the video was on the drive, I was ready to stream it to a computer using its wifi connection.  I had trouble connecting to the hard drive&#8217;s wifi where I finally found  the default password for the wifi (12345678).  Nevertheless, with the wifi connection established, I was ready to start streaming.my video to the computer.  WRONG!  Apparently, you cannot stream content from the hard drive.  You can transfer files to and from the drive, but you cannot stream files.Since you cannot stream content, I was dismayed as to what the point is of having wifi on the drive.  I called Toshiba support to discuss my concerns.  I called the 800 number only to be given a non-toll-free phone number.  After waiting eight minutes on hold, I was given the opportunity to leave a voice message.  It has been over 24 hours and no one has contacted me.Last, but certainly not least, the drive&#8217;s battery does not last long.  Also, the power button does not respond well.  You have to press the power button several times for it to respond.In a nutshell, the drive is awful.  It apparently does not come with a manual.  The support for the drive leaves much to be desired.  The battery life of the drive is a joke and the power button is questionable, at best.  I urge consumers not to purchase this tripe.  I welcome a rebuttal from Toshiba, as I was expecting much more from such a well renowned brand.","rating":1},{"comment":"To me, this is a perfect device to organize, store and share the various photos, videos, and documents people in our household have on their various devices.  For example, my daughter has a laptop, my wife an ipad mini, and myself an ipad.  It takes a little patience and time to set up the storage device.  Now, by having the SSD on in the house, all of us can access any family members files that they wish to share.  Of course you can also do this through your home networking, but by using the SSD wirelessly, it is much easier and faster.  Just think of your SSD as your own &#34;Cloud&#34; storage, turn it on and let your files be available.  And when you travel, take this little guy with you.  Also, free up space on your computer devices and phone.  For example, if you buy an Apple product, you can spend a lot less by choosing the lower storage capability.  No brainer choosing a 16gb over a 32gb saving a hundred bucks, for example.  I didn't have the technical issues some other reviewers had, but I haven't worked all the features yet.

So now, I have received two sleeves so far, one from Herschel and Company and most recently one from Inateck in an effort to find a perfect sleeve\/carrying case.Inateck was kind enough to send me their felt envelope sleeve for the Macbook Air\/Pro a few days ago. I received the green version with the black elastic strap on the front.Build quality: Inateck uses a semi-rigid felt material to fashion an envelope style case. The felt is not as thin and pliable as other felt sleeves and gives the sleeve a somewhat firm feel. The inside of the case is lined with flannel both in the main pocket and the one big front inside pocket and the two smaller back pockets. The lining is just as soft as other sleeves and will definitely protect against any scuffs or scratches of the Macbook Air.Fit: The Inateck Envelope Sleeve fits my Macbook Air very snuggly. While this is great for me, it may turn out to be an issue for others who use a shell cover on their Air or who have a Macbook Pro. I have not tried to use this sleeve with a Pro or with an Air with a cover on it but from what I can tell, I am not sure how well they would fit if my Macbook Air fits very tightly in the sleeve. Is it too tight for my Air? No. For a Pro? At this point that is debatable.Protection: This sleeve offers basic protection for my Air but I would not say it offers drop protection at all. The corners of the sleeve are double stitched with felt so there is a bit more protection in these areas and that is great for sliding in a briefcase or messenger bag, but if you are looking for serious drop protection you may want to check elsewhere.Extras: The sleeve comes with a neat small pouch that can be used to carry your charger if it is coiled up. This is not a necessity and is a pretty nice addition. What I really like best about this case are the extra storage compartments. The sleeve has extra pockets built into the inside of the case (one large slit for documents) and two on the outside (for headphones, your iPhone etc.). These allow you to carry your Air and a few other items while moving from room to room in the library \/ home \/ work. While most sleeve style cases don&#8217;t offer any extra room to carry other items, Inateck has provided this with room to spare.Cons: The only thing I do not like about the case is the black plastic strap in the front. It takes some effort to get the top portion of the case to fit through the black elastic band and I am not sure how the stretchiness will hold up over time. I would have preferred a Velcro or snap closure (while Inateck offers those types of closures in a grey color, they were sold out and I ended up just reviewing what was available). Lack of protection, for me at least, is another con, as the Inateck sleeve offers about half the protection of other sleeves like for example the Herschel and Company sleeve available from the Apple store. Now many people want to carry their Air in as slim a sleeve as possible without worrying about drop protection and for this crowd the Inateck sleeve will definitely fulfill their needs and more.In the end, I was very impressed with Inateck&#8217;s effort at creating a sleeve for the Macbook Air. The quality is top notch, the extras are unique, and most importantly the price ($15 on Amazon) is hard to beat. I would suggest taking a look at the pictures on their site and Amazon before deciding but I am definitely pleased with this sleeve and will plan on using it in as a more dressy and slim option when transporting my Air in my briefcase. Check out the sleeve at Amazon and Inateck&#8217;s website below and if anyone has any questions I would be happy to answer them in the comments below.","rating":5},{"comment":"Got this in the oatmeal color.

Will not hold the larger ones....ie...Nokia 1520....but then I was not expecting it to and would not use it even if it did.You also get a small ,also well made, storage pouch for the power cord.All in all if you are looking for something with some style and color choices than this should work find for you.Just ordered another for my wife in a color she chose.........green......","rating":5},{"comment":"I'm favorable to the usability of this Inatek sleeve, but there are some considerations. On the one hand it's quite versatile and applies to a number of use cases. On the other hand, there are some quirks, and the color I received (as a review sample from Inateck) is a really ugly green--- &#34;DDR&#34; ugly, which I'll explain later.Utility: a number of computers and tablets fit nicely in this sleeve. I was able to get an old Acer netbook in it with reasonable comfort, and newer, slim notebooks will go equally well. Tablets also are easily accommodated, from smaller ones right through the 10 inch deluxe models. The device nestles comfortably in a big pocket and looks pretty safe.There is another full-width pocket in front of the main pocket. This is a very nice idea, and can accommodate a keyboard (if you don't put it in the main pouch) or any number and kind of other accessories, possibly even a large battery pack. (Netbook plus whopper battery pack and cable is my own most common use case.)There are two small pockets on the back. One might be suitable for a small cell phone and the other, slighty larger, might be good for a modest battery pack or a larger cell phone. Earbuds would go nicely in either. The problem is that there is no seal, so smaller things that might fall out, like thumb drives, may not be the best thing here.In fact, since the closure for the whole case is accomplished by folding down a flap and tucking it under an elastic band, you are advised to carry this is in pretty much an upright position. Also, if you use the small back pockets for thicker items, there will be some bulging and a little discomfort in carry the case.The manufacture quality of my sample was fair. There were a couple of missed stitches and the whole thing didn't feel strong or durable (although others have reported good experiences, and my sample has yet to see weeks of hard use).But the appearance?A little background: Inateck is headquarted in Leipzig, Germany. Before the fall of the Wall, Leipzig was in East Germany, a country I spent a little time in during Cold War days. I don't know if this is inadvertent, but the green color and felt look and feel of the case is an exact match for the insignia of the Grenztruppen der DDR--- the East German border guards. I was so shocked I had to check on the Internet to verify my memory of this and unfortunately I was right.Besides being terribly ugly, this color makes instant associations for anyone who was there in those days, and the associations are anything but pleasant.A little advice to Inateck: reminders, even unintentional ones, of the German Democratic Republic (DDR) are not such a great idea. Ditch the DDR green color now and forever.I'm giving this a marginal four star overall rating; it's five stars worth of utility, and a little off for some strange design decisions.","rating":4},{"comment":"This stylish bag and charger bag really took me off guard. It is super super soft inside and out, fits well, and reminds me of something custom-made or that you'd get on Etsy. It protects my Macbook Air 13 very well, and I couldn't be any happier with this protection sleeve\/cover. One thing that makes it unique is that there is a flap inside the top edge that also protects the edge that most other sleeves expose, and others handle with a zipper. I've actually marred the corner of one of my other laptops with a zipper on a different sleeve... no more zippers!Some covers that I've had in the past fit so snug that I feel like I'm going to push the computer through the case when I put it on. This one has just the right amount of give, and the softness inside gives it some polishing love every time. If you are looking to have a unique computer case, this is it! It also snaps closed.By a lot of hard hours and days and years of time spent reviewing, I found myself in the top 10 reviewers on Amazon. This wasn't a goal or self promotion, but by nose-down focused reviewing. I occasionally get contacted by manufacturers or sellers who appreciate my way of reviewing and ask if I'll consider reviewing a product for them, with no obligation or cost. This is one of those products. I assure you that I review what I want, when I want, how I want, in order to share what I feel is the most accurate useful information.","rating":5},{"comment":"Inateck Macbook 13.3 Inch laptop case is a very nice sleeve case for ultrabook size 13.3 (and smaller). This case feels great to touch and compact\/thin enough to carry it comfortably. The design also looks good and I happen to really like the green color of this case. It fits my 13.3 inch ultrabook very nicely (actually a bit tight but not to the point it is annoying and through time\/hours of use I think the case might expand a bit and fit perfectly). I tried several other laptops\/netbooks smaller than 13.3 inch and they works fine too with this case. This case also have additional pockets where you can put your phone or book reader. I am not sure how solid the padding is (less padded than my other laptop bag but good compared to sleeves) and I am not going to test it by bumping or dropping my laptop in this case :) . This bag also come with the small pouch for power adapter or mouse. Overall, this is a nice case and practical to use daily especially if you don't need to carry ac adapter otherwise you might want to have another case where you can put this case and the ac adapter case and your other accessories into that carrying bag. Thanks Inateck for sending me this case.Sidarta Tanu","rating":5},{"comment":"As the name implies, this envelop-shaped cover case 14\" x 9\" is made specifically to fit the MacBook Air; but it also can be used for most other mini Laptops.The elegantly designed case is made of sturdy but soft (&#8539;\" thick) heather grey felt, accented with tan leather. The stitching is uniform and strong. A 4\" x 3\" patch of leather is strategically placed at the bottom to allow for a non-slip grip.The main compartment is lined by smooth soft flannel to prevent scratching of contents.It also has a fold-in divider that comes in handy when carrying my MacBook Air and an iPad, or a pad\/few papers etc.Two flat pockets with slit openings, each 5\" deep and 4.5\" and 3.75\" wide respectively are found on the back of the case and serve to carry a mobile phone, iPod, earbuds, a thin flat battery recharger or a small external drive.The case is not meant to protect against damage from dropping on hard floor or a heavy direct knock.A separate matching felt case 4.25\" x 3.5\" is included for carrying bulky power cords and wall plugs.Another high quality item from \"Inateck\". They seemed to have thought of all possibilities to make this attractive case very functional and useful. Although the price is surprisingly low, it is a very good value.

How nice. It's like a remote control on steroids.  Gives me the ability to fully control my HTPC without the need for a full-sized keyboard and mouse.  Very responsive mouse pad control.  Very compact in size, so think of it as a remote control.  Great product.  Hope it lasts - I will update if any problems surface.","rating":5},{"comment":"One of the main obstacles to the wider adoption of &#8220;smart&#8221; TVs and entertainment center PCs is the lack of convenient and accessible user interface. The traditional remote controls are very limited in their capacity, the touch-screen input is obviously out of question, smartphone apps tend to be buggy and slow, and we are still some time away from a truly effective voice input. There are several good wireless keyboards on the market right now, but most of them tend to be too big and bulky for the intimate space of one&#8217;s living room. This mini keyboard seems to be as close to the ideal solution as they come.I&#8217;ve managed to pair up this keyboard with four different computers or computing devices: Mac Mini, Dell Windows 7 desktop, Android PC-on-a-stick, and LG Google TV. The keyboard paired up well with all of them. I was particularly pleasantly surprised with how well the keyboard worked with my little Android PC-on-a-stick. I&#8217;ve tried using several different Bluetooth keyboards with that little device, and they have all been a disaster. All I had to do with this Rii keyboard is connect the little RF dongle to the Android PC and I was set.The keyboard&#8217;s layout follows more or less the standard QWERTY configuration. The keyboard feels a bit cluttered, but it still more or less works as advertised. the key action feels pretty good, but again you don't want to use this keyboard primarily for typing of long documents. For interaction with smart TVs and similar devices the keyboard is more than adequate.Having the trackpad positioned above the keyboard is one of this gadget's best features. This allows for all of the keys to be easily accessible for thumb typing. The use of the trackpad is a bit more awkward than with some other keyboards, but in my opinion this is a small price to pay for a fully accessible typing.The keyboard feels well built. It looks elegant enough and it&#8217;s also very lightweight. It will definitely feel at place in any living or entertainment room. It might fit all too well though &#8211; you may have to worry about yet another &#8220;remote&#8221; getting lost or misplaced all the time now.Cool little accessory\/gadget that has an important role to play in the modern hyper-connected home.**** Product provided for review purposes. ****","rating":5},{"comment":"Works well.

Small, works perfectly, battery is replaceable, touchpad really nice as mouse replacement. I use it for our living room Ubuntu laptop. This laptop is connected to a projector via HDMI\/receiver.

I am so happy with my choice to buy this product.","rating":5},{"comment":"When my review sample arrived I tested it on a few devices and it worked perfectly on each. The first device was my ancient ThinkPad T61 running Windows XP. I inserted the dongle (look in the battery compartment for it), and it was immediately recognized and activated. As soon as I turned on power to the keyboard I was able to navigate using the touchpad, bring up an editor and type.The next tests were with myKeedox Quad Core RK3188 Android 4.2 1080P 5G 2.4G HDMI Bluetooth 4.0 Smart TV BOX, then using aMicro USB OTG Host Cable to USB 2.0I connected the dongle to my Galaxy Note 3 phone and Tab 3 10.1 tablet respectively and was texting and performing other functions. This is truly a plug-and-play keyboard\/touchpad.One final thing I love is the battery is a standard BT51 that can be purchased just about anywhere if you are such a power user that you need a spare.It's set up for thumb style texting, so most folks will be immediately comfortable with it. I love the tactile feedback from the keys, which were a pleasure to type with, as well as the array of function keys and buttons. If you spend a lot of time on smaller devices this is a dream come true. At about thirteen bucks at the time of this review it's a bargain for folks who are heavy texters.","rating":5},{"comment":"Nice little keyboard.

And i can not leave doggle in, drains battery of phone, but not as fast as an optical mouse\/trackball.  Would love this better if it had a descent size track ball instead of touch pad, had issues that it would repeat long lines of a keystroke  or deletes lots of text when i dont want it to, or rapidly goes to bottom of page, or if forces me to choose an accent letter when I have no need of them, a lot of deleting going on. What the hell is with the accent letters and how the hell to turn that off??? The touch pad only does a small area of screen and not full screen, rather have ball. But did connect with ease.

Even after days of near constant use, I still have to pay attention to aligning it just right - it has not become second nature.And, second, the angle of the tablet to the keyboard is about 110 degrees. This makes it hard to use when your eye line is looking down at the screen (e.g., when standing up.) This also means that the keyboard cannot be folded back to return to an impromptu tablet - say to view something in portrait mode. The only option is to undock - which means you now have to deal with an extra piece of furniture.Despite those minor quibbles, I love the TF103C - it is a joy to use, and everything works just like it is supposed to.This tablet bundle is a winner!Happy Computing!~A_E~","rating":4},{"comment":"I hate this thing...let me correct that - I hate Android devices. This thing is sooooo ridiculously slow you might as well start it and go bake a cake....when the cake is done, maybe this piece of junk will have finished downloading all of it's constant updates or the battery will have drained itself in the 30 minute lifespan it seems to have. I've had this thing for over a year....you turn off the Google Play Store auto updates and when the Play Store app updates itself (which doesn't seem to be affected by that setting), it turns the updates back on...so when you power this thing up, it begins auto downloading gobs of updates rendering the thing almost useless...and that's on a high speed network....then...when you charge the thing (because the updates have drained the battery), it constantly dings about every 10 seconds...so if you're using this in a hotel room and trying to sleep...good luck with that...you have to mute the thing...and if you were planning on using this piece of junk as your alarm clock....see where this is going....Android is just a pile of really crappy apps running on a slow, clunky platform that can't hold a candle to it's more expensive, but waaaay better performing competition over at Apple. I finally have had enough of crap Android devices and have gone over to the iOS camp...scrapping this tablet for an iPad (and am already much happier I did), and next the 'smartphone' for an iPhone.....sorry, but these thing may look cool and seem nice to have, but this thing has been more of an aggravating source of frustration and disappointment than it's been useful....Google Android, go back to the drawing board and try again because this OS stinksI also bought this 'bundle' with the keyboard.....nice idea...but the keyboard constantly comes unattached - if you're using the keyboard for the fact that it allows you to connect USB devices or the fact that it has an SD card slot, then all of that becomes useless as soon as the keyboard unattaches itself....overall, this seemed like a great add on but in the end, I hardly ever use it because it's become so unreliable.....but it looks nice....and that's about the only thing good I can say about it....Time to reset this thing to factory defaults and dump it","rating":1},{"comment":"This is an android tablet, so it want to connect up to your google account, but you can skip through that step during setup also it wants your to register with ASUS but you can also skip that step. As soon as you turn it on you just follow the instructions going through the setup. It is simple and easy.One thing to get use to with is that it is top heavy most laptop are bottom heavy, but since this is a tablet the keyboard section is much lighter than the screen section. But it also makes if feel a bit flimsy when carrying around. The tablet it very easy to disconnect from the keyboard, you just press a button at the top of the keyboard and the tablet pops off. Putting it on is a bit more tricky, but still simple. Just line it up and click it on. When it is docked a icon will show on the top left hand corner of the screen which is helpful.Using it as a touch screen or using the keyboard makes it so much easier too use. I found myself not know how to do something on the keyboard so I just used my finger instead and it made it very versatile.On most laptop, you can push the screen back more depending on the glare or the angle you are using the laptop. But since this is a tablet with a keyboard dock you can only have the screen to 90 degrees it doesn't push back any farther than that. I have never used a tablet that clicks into a keyboard before, so I have to get use to that.The tablet power button is very small on the top. And the charger is on the left hand side of the tablet. The keyboard has a USB port. The tablet has a camera, but it pretty basic. It has some filters and features, but it is very grainy. It also doesn't have a flash from what I can see. It has a forward and back facing camera, and it records as well.It comes preset with a google folder and an Asus folder on the front screen. The Asus folder has 10 Apps in it: Do it later, file manager, Audio wizard, webstorage, contacts, powersaver, supernote, calculator, clock and splendid. It doesn't come with that many extra factory default apps so that is nice. It has a Mirror, which is pretty much camera, and a couple other ones that I haven't seen like Omlet, party link, emusic, movie studio, What's next and zinio.Some of the apps are not notebook version friendly like Omlet comes up vertical so you need to take it off the keyboard and use it as a tablet so that is a bit annoying.Overall, I find this tablet very user friendly. It is a bit heavier than I imagined. It is very quick and either using your finger on the screen or using the keyboard they work seamlessly together and responds very well too. The only thing that bothers me is the flimsiness of the tablet on top of the keyboard but, the tablet itself works fast and efficiently.","rating":4},{"comment":"***ASUS Transformer Pad TF103C-A1-Bundle 10.1-Inch Tablet with Keyboard Bundle - BlackIf you're looking for a 10\" Android tablet with a fast processor at a reasonable price you will probably be very happy with this.  The more I use this tablet, the more I like it.  This is the second Asus tablet I have owned.  I bought the first one 3 years ago.  It still works great but of course tablets, including this new one, have come a long way in speed & display.  I have been using a Google Nexus 7 since retiring my old Asus last year.-The 4.4 KitKat is very fast & smooth.-Intel Atom 1.33 GHz works great & loads apps quickly.-The display is very good\/sharp & has excellent color.  You can easily make color refinements with the \"Splendid\" feature.-I like the keyboard.  I don't have huge hands so it's quite comfortable.  Even my husband who does have large hands finds it easy to type.-Wi-Fi seems to work very well; have had no drops even outside on my deck.-The keyboard connection\/hinge seems very strong & well designed.  To release the keyboard, you just push a button on the hinge & it comes apart.  I have had no problems with it coming apart when I do not want it to.-The battery life seems very good, of course that all depends on how you use it, brightness, etc.-The Asus \"ZenUI\" is really easy to use.  Asus is a leader in useful custom features & apps & this new version is no exception.  From the \"Do It Later\" calendar, \"File Manager\" and  the \"Splendid\" color calibration software, etc. it is easy to use & works really well.-Has a microSD card slot.-Bluetooth 4.0Not so great:-It's heavy!  2 pounds & 7.6 ounces with the keyboard attached (according to my kitchen scale).-Awkward to open it when the keyboard is attached.  There should be some kind of finger indent to make it easier.-The speakers are just OK but when I want to listen to music streaming from the Asus, I will use a portable speaker or ear buds so not a big deal to me.  They are in the back of the screen at the sides.-The cameras are disappointing (very grainy photos) but I rarely use them for taking photos anyway.  They are fine for Skyping.I have not downloaded the \"free\" Asus content.  Doubt I ever will download them because I find those features to be mostly marketing & I prefer to use other music sources & cloud storage.","rating":5},{"comment":"This Asus Transformer Pad is a good tablet when compared to other tablets in its price range.  This is a sub $300 tablet that will make a great gift for less tech savvy people.  It would be a great tablet for kids, and parents who are looking for a cheaper alternative to the iPad.  The Intel processor is very fast and responsive.  I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the apps updated and downloaded.  The build is typical Asus - quality at a bargain.  This product cannot be compared to and iPad or Galaxy tab.  They are on a different level with quality, processor, and specs.  It is a very good tablet in its own rights, though.  I enjoy accessing social network sites, and browsing various blogs on the device.The Pad is made of plastic, but is very well put together.  The keyboard fits well with the tablet, and the pieces connect very well.  It is a bit bulky with the keyboard, and reminds me of the old netbooks from years ago.  It is also quite heavy with the keyboard attached, but still quite portable.  The keyboard has one USB port, and doesn't include a battery.  It is all powered from the tablet.The screen is of an acceptable resolution, but definitely lags behind the higher end models.  Still, the performance and color reproduction are great.  Don't expect a &#34;WoW&#34; experience like you would get with the new Galaxy Tab.  The processor is lively and keeps up with the screen transitions pretty well.  The 1GB of RAM is a letdown, but understood, considering the price point.  This device would be best used for consuming content, and not a &#34;fill in&#34; for your PC.  It handles music and movies quite well, also.  All in all, a good device for someone looking for a budget tablet with a good keyboard.  I would recommend it!","rating":4},{"comment":"I am one of the lucky few who gets to review this product before market launch.  I was also one of the early owner of first generation transformer pad.  The new keyboard, unlike the first generation keyboard with batter, has now no built-in batter to offer extended usage.  It's nice to still have a USB port on the left side.  The KitKat 4.4 is excellent but I won't focus on that.The keyboard dock is very secure and has a nice latching and two metal tab to secure the folding actions.  The release button is also very easy to operate.  However, if you don't push hard on dock, sometimes the tablet doesn't recognize it.My first impression is good.  But when I started to play streaming music off Amazon, I found out there's not a visible speaker port (hidden thru a meshed holes in the back) The music is hidden behind the pad (where it is loudest) and the music is louder if you place the pad facing down and the sound is a bit muffled.The screen glass is very smooth.  When typing with the keyboard, sometimes, the system is busy with updating app, it will miss a few characters.  I guess this is caused by the small amount of RAM (only 1 GB).  The unit is lighter than the previous generation (no more battery in the keyboard).  The bronze finish is not as exotic as before.  The performance is acceptable, considering the whole bundle is sub $300!!!The fact that some apps are default either in portrait or landscape is kind of difficult to use while docked.One last complaint is the battery charges really slowly if you are using it at the same time.  I had it plugged as soon as the unit arrived, with only 30% battery, and after two hours, it is still at only 34%.Also, it only picked up my 2.4GHz wifi and not the 5GHz one.The screen size is 1280x800, very good resolution.  The browsing window is a bit small for me so I often had to enlarge it.The camera resolution is also very low (a new product like this should be at least 5M but it is regretfully only 2M).It's a worthy contender in the hundreds of different tablets in the market, and soon phablets iPhone 6.Hope this is a good review for you to make a wise decision.","rating":4},{"comment":"Might've got a bad unit but the pointer likes to randomly disappear, rendering trackpad completely useless.

This one is definitely making a round trip.","rating":1},{"comment":"Spend enough time with the TF103C and it's patently obvious why it only costs $299. ASUS has whittled the dockable tablet down to the essentials, with just about every luxury tossed aside; you won't find a breathtaking display, good cameras, long battery life or video output. What's left, though, continues to be tempting. This is a brawny tablet for the money, whether or not you use the netbook-like functionality all that frequently. If you do, it might even be an ideal laptop substitute. The Transformer Pad is more expensive than the cheapest Chromebooks, but it's slightly faster and carries an abundance of native apps.You do have to ask whether you need the keyboard at all, though, and that's the real dilemma -- many people don't. If you're no fan of the Transformer concept, the TF103C won't change your mind. The savings from passing on the keyboard can be rolled into a tablet that may not be as good at productivity, but could easily be superior for books, games and movies. Give the Transformer Pad a close look if you're at least mildly curious about the dock; just be sure to keep its competition in mind before you take the plunge.","rating":5},{"comment":"This latest tablet offering from ASUS has a variety of positives and negatives, but overall I found the product to be extremely user friendly (which says a lot coming from a lifelong Apple user who has never operated a Droid device) and economical.POSITIVES-Lightweight-Keyboard works well and snaps off seamlessly, converting your laptop tablet into a much more portable device-Bright screen display with vivid graphics-Great variety of pre-installed apps-Strong Intel processorNEGATIVES- Only 16GB of storage space on the actual device (you can purchase 500GB of online storage)- The camera is laughably bad, 2MP on the main side and .3MY on the front. You will never take a good photo with this device, but that isn't the reason main selling point of this tablet to begin with, so I can't complain too much.-The battery charges at an extremely slow pace. Perhaps I'm spoiled having only had experience with Apple products, but I really do feel like it shouldn't take as long as it does to return this tiny device to a full charge.","rating":4},{"comment":"Update 7\/14\/14: I reset the tablet and in the install process I turned OFF background updates (it's a checkbox in the install process). Then I went into settings>accounts>google and used the menu dropdown to re-enable sync. Why did this work? I don't know but instead of draining 100% overnight it now drains about 2-3% a day when in standby.When you absolutely need to have a physical keyboard on your tablet this is a good choice. The keyboard is responsive and will register nearly all keystrokes though it will miss one now and then if you're trying to type on a soft surface (like in a bed). But overall it's a good stiff keyboard with decent key movement and feedback. However, it is a small keyboard (10 inches by 3.5) so don't plan to type novels on it. The touchpad below the keyboard works quite well, no complaints (it is much better than the ASUS t-100 i have) it is 3 inches wide and 1 and 3\/4ths inches tall, so it's cramped but not tiny.Because size matters a lot in this case here are the exact measurements of the tablet when detached from the keyboard:The viewable screen, 8 and 1\/2 inches wide by 5 and 5\/16th inches tall. The actual tablet itself is 10 and 1\/8th inches wide and 7 inches tall when detached from the keyboard, the thickness is 3\/8ths of an inch. I don't have a triple bean balance to weigh it but it's fairly light and can be held for a while easily in one hand. It comes with Android 4.4.2, bluetooth and wi-fi. it has a lowly 2 MP camera on the back and a pathetic .3MP on the front (seriously ASUS?). If you already have used android there aren't any big surprises here. ASUS adds a significant amount of bloatware that you can't remove, though you can deactivate it by going to settings>app>click the app>disable.The hardware itself is responsive and can handle videos well as well as light gaming. The screen is a pleasure to look at though I did initially struggle with the very annoying \"auto brightness\" feature, I think the latest firmware push fixed that. There is only 16 GB of internal memory and after installing my favorite apps I'm already down to 10.2GB so it goes fast. You won't be able to store a lot of video on this device without adding an SD card (which isn't a big deal as a 32 GB SD card is quite cheap now).So why two stars? Battery life and the cameras. One of the first things I noticed about this device is that it was draining almost all of the battery overnight. When I checked the battery usage chart it was almost all because the wifi was remaining active all night. Fine, I went into the power settings and set the wifi to turn off when the tablet is idle. It didn't help, the battery was still being drained by wifi overnight. So I tried again with the battery settings, this time using \"ultra-saving mode\" which says specifically \"disconnects the network when the device is suspended\". yet still the battery was being drained overnight by the wifi.So the only solution to this is to remember to manually turn off wifi before I set the device down. If i don't do that the wifi will eat up all the battery to the point when the unit won't even power on without being charged first for several minutes. One of the key selling features, as far as I'm concerned, for a tablet is power management. You should not need to constantly remember to plug the device in. In fact, i have an eee pad slider that can literally go for weeks on a single charge if I don't use it much. No such luck with this tablet which will drain its battery in about 2-3 days EVEN IF i turn off the wifi and put the unit in standby mode. That's just poor power management. if you've chosen the \"ultra-saving\" battery mode the tablet ought to be able to last many days without a charge if it isn't being actively used.The camera's are really sad. In this competitive market i don't know how ASUS thinks it can get away with a 2MP and a .3MP camera on the rear and front of the tablet. Just that one drawback alone would be enough to make me look for a different tablet.If Asus can sort this power management issue I'd bump the device to 3 stars. By the way, power management is NOT a problem in the Asus T-100 (I can leave it on standby for many days) which also uses a Bay Trail processor. So I know they can get this right, perhaps a fix is on the way in a firmware push.","rating":3},{"comment":"For the price, this is a very good tablet with keyboard.  It is very fast, well made, and performs very well.  I bought it over a week ago and have used it extensively to wring it out.  Below are my observations:DOCUMENTATION:  There is a 7 page (without appendices) printed User Guide that only shows drawings of the tablet and charging instructions.  And a 10 page printed manual of the Keyboard showing drawings, how to dock\/undock, special keys and the touchpad.  THAT'S IT!  If you want to learn how to use it you have to go to the Web.  There is a very good e-manual PDF file (158 pages), for the tablet on the ASUS Web site.  Go to ASUS>Support>>Service Programs>Downloads and type \"TF103C\" in the search window.  Then android+manual>version \"E9028\" and download file \"e9028_tf103c_for_web_only\" PDF file.  About 8.2 MB. (for English version).  The tablet does have \"Guided Setup\" that starts automatically and guides you through WiFi setup and your Google Account setup.  There is a Icon for this in the \"All Apps\" screens if you need to re-do the setup.I have a cheap ($99) tablet (Nextbook) that I bought from Walmart that has a great printed User Guide, Quick Start Guide, and FAQ's.  If they can do this on a $99 tablet, why can't ASUS do better on a $299 one (or at least put a link to the manual on the tablet)?CONSTRUCTION:  The construction seems real good.  No flexing, squeaking, or gaps anywhere.  When the tablet is docked to the keyboard, there is a slight rocking back and forth in the keyboard slot but the tablet is secure.  The tablet weighs 1 lb, 4 oz. and the keyboard weighs 1 lb, 4 oz.SCREEN:  A very good IPS screen.  Not the highest resolution but I can't see much of a difference between it and my ASUS ME302c which has a higher resolution.  Like my other ASUS, I find the default screen settings to be too dull and too warm.  But there is a pre-installed App (Splendid) that will change the color temperature and vividness. I also need my screen brightness set to about 80% to please me.ASUS ZEN UI:  I like it very much.  It is different than the stock Android, but I prefer the changes made by ASUS.  There are a ton of pre-installed Apps on this tablet that you cannot remove.  But you can remove the Icon clutter easily by \"hiding\" the ones that you don't use or \"disabling\" them.  I don't think that will save you any memory, however, but it is easily reversible.KEYBOARD:  Very nice.  Feels well made (no flexing), the key press is good, and the touchpad is sensitive.  The keys feel a little cramped for me but I have big hands.PORTS:  There are two USB ports (a micro USB on the tablet, and a full size USB on the keyboard).  Both will support a mouse, keyboard, flash drives, and a portable USB powered Hard Drive.  There is NO HDMI port.  The tablet has a speaker\/microphone port and will support a micro SD memory card up to 64GB.ANDROID 4.4 (KitKat):  I have a Lenovo tablet that just updated to Android 4.4.2 and I like the new OS.  But the Lenovo does not have \"Multiple Users\".  Lenovo stripped it out.  This tablet does have \"Multiple Users\" and \"Profiles\".  And there is now a \"Printing\" setting.  The new OS seems very smooth and responsive and there are a number of new \"things\".OPERATION:  This tablet is very fast (Antutu Benchmark =33,336 and Quadrant Standard = 17,983).  Web page loads are very fast.  In over a week of extensive use, there have been no slowdowns, or error messages, or \"double taps\".  It has downloaded and run all the Apps I use on my other tablets except for one (Temple Run, but Temple Run 2 will play).  It froze up once in the web browser (tablet freeze) and I had to hold down the power key until it shut down.  All of the free system memory can be used to store Apps so there should never be a problem.CAMERAS:  This tablet has two cameras.  Front and rear.  Both are low quality.  Android 4.4 has added a number of new camera features you may want to try.  But consider tablet cameras as only back-up devices.  No tablet camera I have ever seen can match a dedicated camera or even a smartphone camera.VIDEO:  I don't watch much video or movies so I can't comment except that it has played all of the videos that I have tried and seems to play YouTube well.  The screen is not high enough resolution to display 1080p but 720p works well.  If you have a problem with any video formats, use a different video player (MX player has always worked  for me).SPEAKERS:  For a tablet, these speakers are good.  The music quality is good and the speakers are loud enough for a small room.WHAT COULD BE BETTER:  There is no external indication of charging.  I like a external LED that shows charging and charged.  The back of the tablet, along with the screen, is a fingerprint magnet.BATTERY:  Charging from 15% takes about 4 hours.  Battery run times using \"Battery HD\" calibration are as follows: (Screen brightness at about 80% and without the keyboard attached).Music Playback = 16 hrs, 40 minVideo Playback = 8 hrs, 20 min.Internet Browsing = 6 hrs, 15 min.Talk time (VoIP) = 7 hrs, 11 min.Reading = 9 hrs, 54 min.CONCLUSION:  I like this tablet and keyboard bundle very much.  It will be my main Android tablet until someone makes one with the same weight but with a 12\" to 14\" screen.  My 74 year old eyes (even with glasses) like more screen area.","rating":5},{"comment":"The ASUS Transformer Pad is a decent 10.1&#34; tablet running KitKat. I was shying away from Android for a while, having given Windows RT a chance (and I liked it, but it was kind of limited), but I decided to give Android KitKat a real chance to impress me, and I have to say I'm definitely happy with some of the KitKat refinements and improvements... Though I dislike that they seem to have completely disabled the ability to move apps to the SD card unless you trick the system, somehow.On the hardware side of things, ASUS always impresses me and this is no exception. The construction is solid, though it does feel a tiny bit more plastic-like than some higher-priced competitors. The micro SD card slot is recessed enough to avoid accidental release. The touch screen is clear, crisp, and doesn't screw up even when using five-point touches. The color is deep and the contrast is decent. The unit doesn't get hot, but I have noticed that-- even on the highest battery-saving setting-- it does go through battery life a little faster than expected.And it's suitably fast. The Intel CPU does, indeed, make a difference in this device. If you want to do more advanced things in Android, you'll be happy to know this seems to be able to handle high-end video, serious gaming, and lots of multitasking.The keyboard is fine-- A little cramped, of course, but you have to expect that in a 10.1&#34; device. However, I absolutely HATE the touchpad. Like my previous ASUS Transformer, the touchpad is way too sensitive and unless I turn it off via the convenient function key at the top of the keyboard, I find myself moving the pointer in the middle of typing. There's no way to adjust sensitivity, either. It's either on or off. Why couldn't this be like the amazingly nice touchpad on my Samsung Chromebook 2? That one doesn't react when your hand gets near it, requiring you to actually touch the touchpad (Hey! What a novel concept!) to make it do anything. This is my one area where I get annoyed with ASUS, and this seems to be a common theme with every ASUS notebook and Transformer I've used or owned (and I've had quite a few ASUS notebooks).However, since this is a touchscreen device, it's no big deal to turn off the touchpad entirely and just tap the screen. The dual USB ports also mean I can connect a standard wireless mouse, and I also have the option of a Bluetooth mouse... So really, the touchpad being horrible is far less of a concern than it could be. Still, ASUS needs to work on this. I've never been satisfied with an ASUS touchpad's sensitivity problems.I do find myself constantly wishing the keyboard dock would have a port for the charging cable, so I could dock and undock the tablet portion without having to connect a cable when I want to charge, or disconnect the cable in the morning when I want to grab just the tablet and go. If it were on the dock, all I'd need to do is put it in the dock or press the release button and remove it, and there'd be no tether. In reality, this dock is just a keyboard, touch pad, and USB hub. That's nice, but these are all functions that could be handled by other external devices just as well, and I think this diminishes the importance of the dock. If it handled extra power, extra storage, or did some cable management, I'd be more pleased.All in all, though, this is a great Android tablet, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new KitKat device. The keyboard is a bonus.I subtracted one star for the lousy touchpad, but this is still a solid, enthusiastic four-star device.","rating":4},{"comment":"I'm putting this review up quickly because I have been having some issues with the Asus website and free \"content and services\" that I think people may want to consider before buying this product.  Hopefully Asus will make a point of fixing these problems quickly, and then I will adjust the review.So far the hardware has been fine.  The tablet and keyboard have been running smoothly for the few hours that I've been trying it out.  It's powerful enough to run HD mkv files without any slowdowns.  The screen's bright but the colors don't pop, and the keyboard doesn't have the features that the more expensive Transformer keyboards do.  There's no extra battery or memory card slots there.  The keys and the layout of the keyboard look and feel about the same as other Transformer keyboards I've tried.  There's bound to be some compromises on a tablet at this price.The Asus website has been a huge disappointment, though.  For a major manufacturer, it's almost shocking.  The first thing I noticed is that images sometimes didn't load.  Instead, I saw that little symbol that tells you there's supposed to be an image but the image file won't show up.  It took many attempts to register the tablet.  I kept getting an error message for the wrong serial number, despite double and triple checking, until I was able to submit the form.  The free \"content and services\" then did not come through.  Even the one that's through Asus, for a free 2 year upgrade to 500 GB of web storage.  The E music offer did go through when I updated and ran their app, however you don't really get 75 free songs, you get 37.50 worth of store credit for signing up with them.  It would only add up to 75 if every one that you bought were songs that sold at their minimum price of 50 cents.I did get a customer service representative fairly through their online instant messaging link, but all he did was give me a link to email them about the problem.  He seemed to have no idea about the offers on the Amazon listing.  And the page he sent me to also failed to work.  I got an error message that told me \"cannot be empty\", even though I filled out every field on the form, even the optional ones.  Error message after error message, and it wouldn't tell me what was missing so that I could fix it.Even if you are not interested in any of the offers in the amazon listing, I think buying this tablet might be a little bit of a gamble.  Even something as simple as redeeming some offers that come with the tablet has been frustrating.  I would hate to have to deal with them if there was some kind of hardware failure and I needed to use the warranty.Edit:  I've had more time to spend with the tablet and am just as happy with that as I was when I received it.  A few other points:  The keyboard does have a usb input, so while the keyboard is attached you can use external hard drives and other peripherals.  Very handy.  Typing on it isn't too bad.  It's cramped, even though I have small hands for a man, but that cannot be helped with one of these small keyboards.  The trackpad is the one part of the transformer that actually felt cheap.  It just feels flimsy and it has this annoying tendency to move the pointer when you press down on it.  You have to push down pretty deeply for a click to register, which probably causes this.  The Atom processor is pretty zippy too.  I tested it with an MKV file at 1080p and it ran well.Problems with Asus's website and customer service continue, though.  I did get a code for the Zinio subscriptions through e-mail a couple of days after sending in a complaint on the website, which took many tries, just like registering the tablet did.  Asus did nothing to explain how to redeem the offers mentioned on the Amazon listing, so I have no idea if I got the code because I complained or because it takes a couple of days to process it after you register with Asus.  Again, ASUS gives you no instructions and doesn't tell you what to expect.  With the e-music offer, it appeared after I updated the e-music app.  You have to register to receive it that way, though, so I'm not sure it would work if you're already an e-music customer.And I STILL haven't received the free 500 GB from ASUS, days after sending in a complaint, or a reply from them.  This is easily the best of the offers that ASUS says they are giving away.  I'm going to try Tien, who responded to my complaints in the reply section of my review.  I shouldn't have to through so much hassle and confusion to get these things.  Either they are purposely making it difficult for people to take advantage of these offers, or they are just disorganized, but they need to do a better job communicating with customers.  What happens if you get a lemon and need your tablet replaced or repaired?  Is it going to be this difficult to deal with the company?","rating":3},{"comment":"...between an iPod Nano (7th generation) and whatever other device is connected at the USB end.This cable seems slighlty thicker than the Apple OEM.

Once clamp and screw shelve into arm, this stay exactly where you put it. The arm itself is make out of metal and it's flexible but require some pushing around. It will not move by itself which is great.In my experience for my desk which is about a little bit less than 2\" this clamp fits well. My headboard in  my bed unfortunately was bigger than 2\" and this did not fit there. I as able to clamp to the side of my bed instead. The arms is is almost 2 feet long (22\") which provide ample reach.The shelve that clamp into the ipad is plastic. I believe this is by design so that it can gives and easily squeeze ipad into w\/o damaging it. I could see an aluminum part here instead but that would require some extra clamping mechanism. Overall the plastic is ok for me, it's hard and didn't have any risk of ipad falling out. It survive the constant hammering of my 7 months old baby hands on it.","rating":5},{"comment":"This desk clamp mount is great for keeping your iPad &#34;floating&#34; on your desk without taking up precious desk real estate. The arm is extremely durable, made mostly of metal components, yet it's still flexible. The arm does require a bit of force to bend, but it'll certainly keep your iPad in place while you're using it.One significant drawback for me, I wish the length of the arm was adjustable. I have a relatively shallow desk, and even with the clamp mounted at the back edge of my desk, the arm protrudes too far out. They could have made the base of the arm adjustable by sliding it farther into the clamp itself.I also wouldn't have minded a more universal clasp for the iPad itself so that it could work with a variety of tablets or with my iPad with the case still on.Overall, it's a very high quality mount that serves it purpose quite well.","rating":4},{"comment":"Ever since I got my iPad, neck fatigue was an issue and so I figure I needed to have it in a place that was a little more appropriate and make it more of a screen that was eye level.

The flexible support rod (gooseneck) is flexible but extremely stiff to adequately support the pad in whatever position  I found necessary.  The pad retaining clip is lightweight plastic.  Despite the appearance the pad retaining clip was completely adequate to retain the ipad4's 652 grams (1.437 pounds) weight. The kit has included four cable routing clips which are very handy to manage a charging cable along the gooseneck to the device. I was pleasently surprised to find that the lower grips of the pad retainer clip fit perfectly on a cheap generic 7&#34; tablet I use to keep household inventory for the dreaded weekly trip to the market.

With the protection case, my iPad Air cannot be used on the holder. Each time I have to remove the case then put the iPad on. This is not very convenient.

Heavy, sturdy, and high quality, this is something that will get quite a bit of use.The portion of the stand that holds the display is a three-point plastic clip design. The lower left and right corners fit into the curved edges, and the top horizontal clip snaps the iPad into place. It's much more secure than it might initially look, and it's not going to fall out of the mount.The gooseneck is a thick and stiff design (nearly 2ft in length) that doesn't move with the weight of the iPad on the end. It doesn't matter how you bend it... the iPad isn't going to creep or shift downward. It took a bit of time to find the right angle I wanted, but once it's in place, it's really in place.The bracket has two mount points for the gooseneck, depending on whether you need to mount the bracket horizontally or vertically. Like the rest of the unit, it's heavy and sturdy, and there's NO chance that the bracket will slip once you tighten it up on the edge of your desk (or wherever you decide to put it).I have a similar device that I use for my iPhone, but it would in no way be able to handle the weight of an iPad.

For tablet enthusiasts, like me, its a &#34;nice to have&#34; that I use occasionally and enjoy.  As other reviewers have noted, it has a solid feel, with both the right heft and texture to make you feel like you are using an actual artist's (or contractor's) pencil.There is a bit of a learning curve with it, as with all devices, and the fact that you can only use it with Paper is certainly a limitation, but overall, it's a solid addition to a tablet users arsenal of styluses, and I'm confident that the limitations that other reviewers have noted will be addressed through various patches and releases to the software that pairs with the stylus.","rating":4},{"comment":"Yeah, yeah, it's expensive but that shouldn't be a shock to anyone who does 'Apple', right? And this one is actually happens to be a great pencil\/stylus. It works well with Paper by FiftyThree, of course and it works well with everything else.The 'carpenter' form factor somehow, makes it very pleasant to operate. Both the tip and the eraser end do exactly what you'd expect them to do and the Pencil would be just perfect if it was pressure sensitive but it's a great drawing tool even without it.More positives? It's comfortable to hold, just the right weight and well balanced, good palm rejection, comes with a spare tip and eraser, easy to charge by plugging it into any powered USB port, good magnetic attachment to iPad's smart cover.Besides the already stated apparent lack of pressure sensitivity and 'price', all else is super. Enjoy.","rating":4},{"comment":"I'm interested in learning how to draw. I started out with paper and pencil, but I realized that because I aspire to someday be able to draw for a living, I need to go digital. Eventually, I should end up working on a Wacom Cintiq. But that's not a good place to start unless I win the lottery.I thought that my iPad would be a great start. A while ago, I purchased the best quality stylus I could find. Since they are all pretty much a piece of rubber on a stick, they aren't expensive and one is pretty much like another. I was disappointed. Then one day, I came across pressure sensitive styli that could be recognized by some apps. Palm rejection was also possible. The palm rejection however, did not work well with that stylus and I suspect it's because the apps were not custom designed for the stylus.Finally, I came across this one. I thought I'd give it a try, but I was certain that it would ultimately fall short. I was surprised. First of all, the &#34;Paper&#34; app that was specifically designed to work with this device, is itself perfect for a budding artist learning to sketch and draw. The word &#34;intuitive&#34; is overused these days, but that's exactly what it is. Familiar gestures work the way you would expect. Pinch to close, swipe to flip pages, etc.. You can create books (sketchbooks, journals, etc.) on the fly, and pages are easily added or deleted. I like the fact that the &#34;pencil&#34; has an eraser end. I don't have to click on an eraser icon first. I just flip the pencil as I would with a normal pencil.Because the app was designed to work specifically with this product, palm rejection works perfectly!This device is not pressure sensitive, but line thickness in the fountain pen mode varies with the speed of your stroke. Pressure sensitivity is good, but for a beginner like me, this product is just fine.I like this product so much that I bought a &#34;briefcase&#34; style case to carry my iPad and this stylus.My evaluation is from my perspective, as a person just learning to draw. But from where I sit, this thing is fantastic. I'm going to buy one for my niece, who loves to draw. She'll love it!","rating":5},{"comment":"Pencil reminds me of a carpenters pencil. It's wide shape feels very organic and I love the walnut finish. Since I already had the &#34;Paper&#34; app on my iPad, I was able to get to work right away.Pencil uses lower power bluetooth to connect to the iPad and doesn't require pairing other than touching the activation circle on Paper. I had problems getting it to sync now and then, but once I learned to slow down a bit, it got much easier.When using Pencil with Paper, Pencil adds features such as an eraser and you can set Paper to only draw when Pencil is connected and touches with your finger can blur and blend things you've drawn. Paper's blurring and blending abilities are very limited though and it doesn't work quite as well in practice as it does in theory.One thing I'm disappointed is missing is pressure sensitivity since Pencil would be ideal for that sort of thing. It's one feature of my Wacom tablets that I love and I would have liked to see it included in Pencil.Durability of the tip will be an issue over the long term. While the tips are not expensive, they seem rather fragile overall. I'm afraid that one day, I'll drive the sensor down through the tip and scratch my privacy screen.And now that we're on the subject of using Pencil with screen protectors, I've had most of my issues with Pencil when using it through a screen protector. The tips texture isn't smooth and will, over time, tend to catch bits of dust and detritus and scar the screen protector. That coupled with the extra friction of the tip with the plastic screen makes it a pain at times to draw as effortlessly as I like.I really wanted to like Pencil more than I do. It's a beautiful device, but the features don't add enough value when you consider the cost.","rating":3},{"comment":"This stylus oozes good looks - right from its unique packaging, its wood finish, its distinctive shape, to its sleek minimalistic aesthetics. Unfortunately, this beauty is only skin deep - charging it involves some level of dis-assembly, and a worry about where to place the remaining parts of the stylus while it is charging.By default, the Pencil works as a spongy-tipped capacitive stylus - in any app, across all tablets, and even without being charged (since it does not use its Bluetooth radio.) Unfortunately, it is too expensive to be used in that mode.However, its true power (no pun intended) comes from its implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy (v4.0) which allow its more advanced features to be brought online. However, this does mean that it requires iPad versions that support this specification, namely the iPad 3 and later.When powered up, the Pencil\/53 can actively detect when it is pressed (using buttons at both ends) and communicate that to the the iPad. This lets you use the Pencil\/53 as naturally as you might use a real pencil (write with one end, and erase using the other.)The iPad-only Paper\/53 app (2012 app of the year) is designed to engage the complete feature set of the Pencil\/53 - it knows the difference between the writing tip and the eraser end (erase), your finger (blend mode), and your palm (palm rejection). The app also allows easy Bluetooth connection, without going in to the iPad settings menu (by touching and holding a connection icon in the tool palette.)Personally, I found that I quite enjoyed using this stylus - connection was quick, there was no lag, and its ratio of charge to use time was very decent. I also liked its ability to stick securely to my iPad. It took me a while to get comfortable with the carpenter's pencil-styling, but I got there eventually.The nib is very soft, and moves smoothly across my screen. This is a good thing because I had to remove my screen protector to get this to work, and it would have been tragic to have my screen scratched by this stylus. However, this extra softness means that you need to bear down on the stylus a bit, so the tip can wear itself out very quickly. I used mine for about two weeks before I noticed it wearing out. Fortunately, it comes with a replacement, but I'm now even more conscious about wear and tear on the nib.The design of Paper\/Pencil comes from a team with a great track record (Xbox\/Kinect) and has venture funding from Horowitz\/Andreesen (Interestingly, I just completed reading Ben Horowitz's book &#34;The Hard Thing about Hard Things&#34;.)~A_E~","rating":4},{"comment":"The documentation with this says it's for use with iPad 3+ or iPad mini. Well I have an iPad 2 but thought let's try and get it to work anyway. Which it very easily does. You simply charge the tip of your pencil by USB, download the paper 53 app, make sure your bluetooths on, and start drawing. You have three sketchbooks you can fill up and page thru and you can also see In Paper which is drawing others have posted. You can email drawings or post them to your chosen social media.I was a little irked that all the tools they show you in their starter tutorial don't come standard. You have to buy the mixer tool, and all the other brushes, marker, and pencil are an extra $1.99. So you only have one drawing tool, a pen, that you can use without paying additional money. All of the drawings can be done nicely but have a vague cartoon feel to them. I think this would be great for keeping kids occupied or if you are the type who has a sudden sketch idea you need to doodle out for later. I would have liked this tool to be used for writing as well with 53 being able to sync to word. I have tried several of those kinds of pencil tools and this one definitely has the best hand to screen ability. I think that's because instead of literally trying to make the pencil a stylus or pen that writes on a screen digitally, this pencil has a cushy tip for transference and a bit of weight to the pencils body.","rating":4},{"comment":"There's a lot to like about the Pencil, from its carefully designed feel in the hand to its resistance against the screen to how much nicer it makes drawing on the iPad. If you're truly committed to digital sketching it's a tool unlike any other, and together with the Paper app ( a very nice touch, how buying the hardware unlocks all the in-app tools) it may be just the ticket. It'll especially be nice when pressure sensitivity and more variation depending on how you hold the tool becomes possible -- a promised feature with the iOS 8 release in a few months. The thing is just that it's not really good for much else besides drawing in Paper, and it's a bit expensive for novelty value; I'd certainly recommend thisnifty product, but only for heavy sketching users who already spend a lot of time on the iPad.","rating":4},{"comment":"I like the paper app and was excited to upgrade to something futuristic like this. Sensitivity, precise control, made specifically for paper... It is none of those things. I'm running an air w\/64gb 40 free. And this pencil lags. There's no pressure control. It's seemingly less precise than my other styluses. The nib is floppy and thin and cheap.  How they could have messed this up so bad I have no idea. Don't buy into the hype unless you want lots of frustration.","rating":1},{"comment":"Pencil by FiftyThree is both an ordinary stylus and an enhanced one, depending on what application you are using.If you use the Paper by FiftyThree app, with the stylus, you are in for a treat.  It is intuitive and precise and an absolute joy.  More than once, my disbelief was thoroughly suspended, and I felt like I was making organic, tactile art rather than creating art digitally, without ever opening a tube of paint or a jar of ink.  It was a fantastic feeling and so relaxing because I really did not, for once, think &#34;I'm using a stylus&#34;, as it does, within the Paper app, work so intuitively like a non-digital pen, brush, eraser, pencil.Set up was easy after I charged the battery with one of my MacBook's USB ports.  Connection was fairly straight forward and I like that whenever I pickup Pencil, it just works for me.  I have other devices (cameras, another stylus, printers, etc) that are hit or miss whether they will connect with my iPad mini.  Pencil seems much more reliable and I wish other manufacturers would catch on to make device integration as smooth and easy, so those of us who use such devices could get back to working and creating with them.I do wish there was a way to get the functionality, within the Paper app, to crossover to other apps (all apps!) as I think I would only put it down to recharge.The hand feel is fantastic.  The shape is like a carpenter's pencil, which is much easier for me to hold and create with than a regular, round barrel, due to arthritis in my hands.  The materials are lovely.  I have developed sensitivity to many rubberized coatings on other products, so I was thrilled that the Pencil only has anything rubbery on the tip, but the part that is in your hand is brushed aluminum which doesn't cause any issues for me at all.","rating":4},{"comment":"I just discovered the &#34;paper&#34; app and love it! When you purchase the 53 pencil you get the full version of the app with all the tools available. It works great on my ipad and I love the tutorials available to help learn.I do have a couple of gripes. One, I haven't really been able to get used to the strokes which work opposite of what is natural for me. Instead of starting fat and going thin on a stroke, this works the opposite and the stroke gets thicker towards the end. Since this is not a pressure sensitive pen, it works with speed to simulate pressure. I haven't been able to get used to that.The other thing that is more of an irritant is the pen cuts out as i get to the edges of the paper. I am using an ipad, but towards the edges it sometimes stops drawing.Other than that, I think it's an awesome pencil. It feels so nice and smooth and is a perfect weight (not to heavy or too light). If you can afford it, it is way better than a standard $9.99 stylus. $60 is quite a bit to pay, but you will get hours of use out of it if you like to draw or just doodle or tangle.My favorite tutorial is located at: mademistakes dot com","rating":4},{"comment":"Pencil stylusModel: Graphite (aluminum)Manufacturer: FiftyThreeAmazon price: $59.95I&#8217;m a graphic designer and an artist. I have used well over a dozen styli since the iPad was first introduced. Each has a different &#8216;feel&#8217; and each reacts with the glass screen in its own unique way. Some have hard tips, some have spongy soft tips. I find the hard tips skid on the glass too easily and the big sponge tips are not accurate. The most important feature of a stylus is AIM. You need to know exactly where the tip will make contact on the screen. The Pencil by FiftyThree is very accurate and even though the tip is soft, it works well on the glass screen.FiftyThree makes one of the few really excellent iOS drawing apps for the iPad called Paper. A fringe benefit of using the Pencil is that it unlocks all of the tools in the Paper app. These are in-app purchases if you don&#8217;t have the Pencil. Conversely, the Pencil will work as a normal stylus with other drawing apps for iPads, tablets and phones.In addition to drawing with the Paper app, the Pencil provides palm-rejection. This means that you can actually rest your hand on the screen while using the Pencil and only its tip will be active. No extraneous smudges. Speaking of smudges, your finger can be used to soften and smudge your artwork when using Pencil. Perfect for shading. Flip the Pencil around and, as you would expect, the back end is a soft-tipped eraser.Pencil has an odd carpenter&#8217;s pencil shape, but I quickly adjusted to it. It feels good and solid in the hand and the weight feels just right. Grip the tip between two fingers and the interior pulls out exposing the battery and a thin USB plug at the end. You can recharge the battery from any charger or USB port on a computer. Charging only takes a few minutes.The Pencil is packaged with a spare drawing tip and a spare eraser tip. The extraordinary tubular package is all paper and cardboard. No plastic. The entire product demonstrates careful, responsible design.I really like drawing with FiftyThree&#8217;s Pencil and if you are an artist or interested in art, I think you will as well. Highly recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"The charger fits into any USB plug. You have to take the pen apart to do this. I am not a big fan of this. I don&#8217;t want to take my pen apart to do anything other than change the replacement tip. But the process is simple enough and is not a deal breaker. The instructions said it takes 90min to charge the battery but It takes 60min. It comes with replacement tips for the pen and eraser. It&#8217;s very easy to install the tips.To use it, you have to download the FiftyThree app. It&#8217;s free, but the other features cost $1.99 each and there is an essentials for $6.99. I really enjoy the app a lot. Does it work on other apps? I tried it with Sketchbook and a Disney drawing app. It works as a regular stylus but does not have the features it would have when using it in the FiftyThree app, for example, the eraser does not work. Sketchbook does not recognize the pen as a bluetooth. That&#8217;s disappointing. However, all the features work in the app Goodnotes.For some reason after using in other apps it would not sync to the FiftyThree app again until I restarted my iPad. I had to do that a couple of times. Other times it was find, so it&#8217;s a little fickle.It is a very responsive pen. With some pens, the markings lag, but I never found that to be an issue. Also within the FiftyThree app there is palm rejection.I use the adonit jot pen and I&#8217;ve used the Wacom pen. I like this pen better than the Wacom and it is softer on my surface than Adonit Jot.The price tag. Compared to other stylus is the price worth it? I&#8217;ve seen artist use a $10 stylus vs one of these. If you know what you&#8217;re doing then a $10 is going to make no difference. It will really boil down to comfort and features. Some will find this pen not very comfortable because of the shape. It&#8217;s hard to know where to start with this pen. Also the surface of the pen is slippery. Those might be things you&#8217;re thinking about when you look at the pen. To be honest, I wasn&#8217;t sure, but after using it for a while I found the pen very comfortable. However, at the price of $60 or $75 for the Walnut color, it could use some more features to justify it.","rating":3},{"comment":"Until I received Pencil I had not used the free Paper app. Once you have the Pencil you synch it with Paper and it unlocks a few of the extra features that normally cost $7.99. In order to use these features you must be connected to wifi and synched.This is a stylus. Mine is black graphite which I feel is a little slippery. It is shaped like a carpenter's pencil which takes getting used to. It has a good heft to it, it is weighed well.When using the pencil drawing tool in Paper I just can't get used to writing with such a fine tip when the tip on the Pencil is wide.I rate this product 4 stars because it is expensive. You can use Paper with a finger and with any other stylus that costs $10 or less.","rating":4},{"comment":"Excellent responsiveness, extremely easy to enter data, pencil feels very natural when writing.

These together allow for the greatest drawing and sketching on the iPad to date.The Pencil stylus pairs perfectly with my iPad in seconds and immediately activates palm rejection. The palm reject software executes perfectly and I never have issues with bleed-over or errant strokes (Tip: If you have multitasking Gestures turned on, you may find the iPad wanting to switch apps when it detects the pencil and palm of your hand. This is a result of the iPad software competing with the Palm Rejection software). Additionally the Pencil unlocks every tool in Paper along with blend mode, all of which add exciting new dimensions to your drawings. Eraser mode works as advertised as well, and is also extremely handy.I have the Walnut version of Pencil with the Magnet, and am thoroughly pleased with its ability to snap into place on my iPad and stay with a firm hold. The pencil's design might seem odd at first, but I love the ergonomics and have quickly become comfortable with both drawing and writing with it. Even apart from Paper, the Pencil works as a &#8220;dumb&#8221; stylus quite well.There are only two drawbacks I have noticed:The first is the gap between the rubber tip and the pressure sensing nub. As with many styli that use this type of tip you get a significant &#8220;flat and drag&#8221; feel. Use too little pressure and the stylus won&#8217;t conduct well and stokes will be lost. However, with the correct amount of pressure the sensing nub works as advertised and strokes move beautifully from thin to fat with ease.The second drawback is drawing on a screen protector. I use a matte protector that reduces glare. The Pencil&#8217;s wide tip and the amount of pressure I use left smudges all of the surface of the protector that were not easy to clean. Note that these were not scratches, but still annoying to the point that I needed to remove the screen protector. The stylus still leaves smudges on the glass, but these are easily wiped off. Unfortunately this is part and parcel of all rubber tipped styli, but it is especially noticeable with the Pencil.Over all, I have a great impression of Pencil by 53 and it is king of all styli when paired with the king of all drawing apps, Paper by 53. A great buy!","rating":4},{"comment":"Frist, this is a beautiful tool to hold. The feel of the walnut and the quality are impressive (as they should be for this price, it's an expensive product).  It works well, most of the time, with Paper app it's designed to work with, and it will work as a regular stylus, though for non-Paper use I'd just as soon use a cheap stylus that I would care about losing, as it doesn't work any better than a regular stylus when not in Paper. (This shouldn't be an issue as the magnet works well in terms of clamping it to the iPad, but I like holding the iPad without anything attached to it.)There are some issues with it: I tried it with a screen protector and it's not nearly as accurate with it on. If you really need a screen protector, you may be disappointed.And there are connectivity issues. Not all of the time, but enough of the time that you have to take that into account, you can't just assume you can pick it up and start using it. That's another reason why it hasn't replace a regular stylus for me: I don't use Paper all of the time, and since it's just like any stylus functionally with all other apps, I prefer using a regular style for the other apps as I know it'll work.I'm hoping that the connectivity issues aren't hardware related, and that app updates will help, but I'm not sure. So as much as I like this, if you don't really need it right now, and can wait, I'd give it a while and see what happens.","rating":4},{"comment":"This little gem has become my go to stylus for my iPad.  The fact that I already owned &#34;Paper&#34; by 53 was a nice bonus, however, I don't really use that program all that much.  Using it with that program, all of the in app purchases are unlocked (I guess they figured you dropped the money on the Pencil, so they would be nice) which is a nice feature.  The pencil needed charged about 30 minutes before it would work, and once I opened the Paper application and synced the pencil, I had no problems.I really like the feel of the pencil using it just to get around my iPad.  The rubber tip seems a little weak to me, but only time will tell.  It also ships with an extra rubber set of tip and eraser.","rating":4},{"comment":"This a good stylus.

Is is a self described aspiring artist. Before giving it to her she had played around with the companion app Paper, but never really spent much time there. After linking this to her iPad, it seems that it is all she wants to do.It is very impressive, though also a very expensive iPad stylus. I do question its long term usability as the rubber seems like it will both wear out and fall off.If you need a simple stylus, this may not be the best choice. But if you are looking for something that will inspire you... or will work natively with Paper, this should definitely be considered.","rating":4},{"comment":"The Pencil by FiftyThree is one of the nice iPad styluses I have used. It has a great feel to it, and looks great. The tip is very soft and mush, but when drawing with it this is not noticeable and the drawing and the &#34;pencil&#34; feels very natural and easy to work with. Connecting the iPad is a piece of cake and the pencil unlocks all of the tootles in the Paper app. However, they only stay unlocked with the Pencil connected. I love how turning the Pencil over activates the eraser with the Paper app.As I said, I love the look. It looks like drawing pencils I used to use made out of all graphite. I especially like the charging method which has you remove the tip revealing a USB connector to charge in any USB charger.My only concern is the tip itself. It feels thin and I would be concerned that it will easily tear over time and not last as long as other tips I have used. Thankfully, a back up tip and eraser are included.The stylus shines in the Paper app but works in any drawing app as a drawing tool.I do wish this was pressure sensitive, but overall it works great and is one of the best feeling iPad tools I have tried.","rating":4},{"comment":"I bought this with high hopes- it's a lot of dough to drop on a stylus that works with one app. I will say I am glad I sprung for the wood version- the wood is lovely and feels great in my hand. I'm a trained artist so I'm very comfortable with this kind of pencil.I love the Paper 53 app- it is cleverly and beautifully limiting. I do believe that they have not quite hot the right balance though, and this stylus factors into that belief.The first thing I will say about it is that there is a learning curve. It's pressure sensitive and it takes awhile to get the hang if it. If you don't push down hard enough, you get a weird annoying smear. When I am shading I naturally use quick, light strokes, and that is one of the things that causes the smear, so it gets frustrating. It's counterintuitive.I did find that once I practiced for awhile, I had an easier time of it and was getting better results, and for sure better than a plain stylus. It is a fun toy for me at this point- I don't think it is useable if I'm under the gun to actually produce something.I think if a few of the issues I have with the app were corrected, the stylus would be infinitely more useful. Paint badly needs a layers option. It also badly needs options to adjust tool width and opacity. Just those two simple things would bring it into a whole new realm of usefulness. I do understand imposing limitations similar to actual media, and why they would want to do that, but honestly, if my marker is too thin, I go pick up a thicker one. If my paint is too opaque I water it down.... That should be part of the paradigm for this app if they are truly going for realism.For example- if the app had layers it would be lovely to do your watercolor on one layer and then be able to draw with pen and ink on a layer above it. It's no different than waiting for your colors to dry then pulling out your ink and pens. And your pens will most likely have more then one tip width.As far as smoothness, the stylus is a little mushy. There's space between the end of the tip and the actual end of the rubber bit over top, so it has to be pushed down against your screen when you draw. This is not the smoothest technique. Being able to flip it over and use the eraser is nice though.I hope they keep developing this.","rating":3},{"comment":"I am running the &#34;Pencil&#34; on an iPad 4.  The drawing application needs to be downloaded from the AppStore.  There are only a few standard tools.  Upgraded tools and effects need to be purchased which is a drawback.With respect to pairing, simply touch the stylus to the icon in the application.  The pencil feels natural and the 'eraser' function is a nice touch.  Recharging the pencil requires a USB plug which can go into a laptop or USB adapter for the wall outlet.It's useful if you're into sketching or illustrating.  For day to day use, I find it to be a little bit of overkill.","rating":4},{"comment":"This might be the best iPad stylus so far, which means it's pretty good, however it still might not be good enough for your actual use.The stylus itself is bluetooth, and pairs to the iPad which gives some additional functionality.  It's easily rechargeable (simple pull out the main tip and there is a usb connector male end right there, very simple).There are a couple of issues I have with this, the main is that this seems to only work with their own app.  It's a good app, but I would love to see a SDK so other developers could integrate with the pencil as well.  The other is that the sensitivity is still not great.  iOS 8 will supposedly help with this as the touch points are actually variable (meaning how you touch the screen with the pencil means you'll get a different size line).It's a good concept, and electronics\/packing wise it feels very solid.  Feels like they will keep supporting it and making it better via software and updates, which is a good sign.","rating":5},{"comment":"I am an architectural planner and designer and have used the Pencil stylus to primarily make sketches and take meeting notes. It has become my preferred stylus, and has given the Paper 53 App much more usability. I have also been using the Pencil stylus with Penultimate (Evernote) App with great success.Pros:* Well-designed and functions as promised.* The carpenter pencil design is comfortable to hold in my larger hands.* Recharges quickly (90 minutes via USB), and charge lasts a long time.* Reliable palm rejection. Pencil does not mistake my hand for the stylus.* Tip is right consistency for iPad use. Comes with an extra tip and eraser.Cons:* Graphite version does not have magnetic hold to iPad, and therefore ends up getting misplaced easily.* No pressure sensitivity with Stylus or Paper 53 App.* Price point is expensive for those just wanting to try. After using, I can say it is worth the price.Definitely recommended for those who use the Paper 53 App for sketching and note taking.","rating":5},{"comment":"I love everything about the Pencil by FiftyThree. First, it works great as a &#34;dumb&#34; stylus for iPhone and iPad and it's the best one i've used out of probably 10 different ones over the years. (The second best is probably the Cosmonaut) But where the magic really happens on this stylus is when you charge it via USB and sync it to your iPad on the Paper app. It opens up a whole new world of possibilities where you can use the opposite end as an eraser, and you can use the pencil to draw lines and your finger to smear them like a real pencil.Also, great news for the upcoming IOS 8 which will allow a type of pressure sensitivity which will yet again take this device to another level and remove the small advantage the Microsoft Surface claimed to have over the iPad. I highly recommend investing in this stylus, especially if you use the Paper app at all. It's really a cool device, and by far my favorite iPad accessory to date.","rating":5},{"comment":"I had high hopes for this stylus.  I am an avid user of Paper by 53, and the new Pencil offers some features I've been wanting for awhile.  Unfortunately, the stylus isn't all its cracked up to be.  First off, be aware if purchasing that despite the rugged look of the tip, it is made of flimsy rubber like so many other styluses.The device pairs to bluetooth easily enough, simply by touching it to a dot on the screen when Paper 53 is on.  You can set a few different parameters in the app preferences.The literature boasts that the iPad knows the difference between the Pencil and your hand - supposedly you can use your hand for blending and the pencil for drawing.  I find that this is not always the case.  Frequently the iPad reads the Pencil tip as a finger and shifts spontaneously to blend mode, which is annoying when I'm working with sharp line tools.  The only way I've been able to work around that is to manually turn the blend option on and off in preferences, which requires backing out of the drawing I'm working on and a few moves in the menu to accomplish - hardly the most convenient feature.  Another workaround is to shut off the bluetooth connection when working with the line tools, but this shuts off the eraser function as well as the drawing function, which kind of defeats the purpose of having the thing in the first place.So I'm sticking with my Adonit Jot Pro for now.This thing is pretty and a great idea, but there are lots of adjustments necessary before it is really ready for the consumer.","rating":3},{"comment":"So, I have three styluses now:The PencilWacom Intuos Creative Stylus for iPad Air, iPad 3\/4 and iPad mini (CS500PK0)And the original Wacom BambooIn my opinion, the Pencil blows the original Wacom Bamboo away in terms of general comfort to hold while drawing. This is obviously going to make a difference depending on the person, but the size, shape, and construction materials feel great.Where the Pencil doesn't hold up is when comparing it to the Wacom Intuos Creative Stylus. Comfort wise they are both fine, although I do still somewhat prefer the Pencil, but you buy a bluetooth enabled stylus for pressure sensitivity. While the pencil works fine in the Paper app it works in none of the other major apps like Procreate.This means you also need to take into account the value of the Paper app, and it just isn't versatile enough to fill the needs that many who want pressure sensitive pens have. I'm not saying that Paper is a bad app. I use it all the time. It just doesn't do all that much with the pressure sensitivity provided by this pen. For the most part the app works the same as if you were using any stylus.I also prefer the buttons on the Wacom over the eraser on the Pencil. First, the buttons are programable in most apps. You can use them to erase, undo, redo, etc. Plus there are two of them.Add on that the Pencil is $30 more than the Wacom Bamboo Creative stylus right now and it is a no brainer to grab the Wacom. Hence why I think the Pencil is only worth three stars. Now, if I start seeing mass support of this stylus in other apps, or Paper adds a lot more features, then I will happily change my rating.","rating":3},{"comment":"I'm a programmer, not an artist. And to the extent I make art these days, I deal in vectors, not bitmaps. But I appreciate what the 53 people are doing with this stylus. They took their amazing, tour de force of an app, looked at its biggest weakness (finger painting and passive styli) and had the gaul\/guts to say \"let us not wait for Apple, let us make our own hardware\".Of course, gaul and guts are no replacement for execution and results.I say that while not perfect, Pencil improves on Paper. For me, the most natural feature it adds is that I can be drawing something, decide I need to smudge in some shading and without even thinking, my forefinger is smudging instead of drawing and then I go back to using the Pencil.The hardware is nice. While the tip is a bit floppy, and I worry about the warning about not using a screen protector, it has excellent balance and fits in my hand perfectly. The charging is a bit iffy, the partial USB plug integrated into the pull out core can pull away from charging--but as you charge on the order of every few months, not a big deal. I tend to think they went too over the top with the design of the packaging; the use of a cardboard mailing cylinder results in the documentation being curled up and the auxiliary parts being hard to find. Still, it is a beautiful looking piece of hardware.If you are a frequent, and by this I mean daily, user of Paper, I think you owe it to yourself to give this stylus a try. I think you will find it gives back more value than it takes.","rating":4},{"comment":"For several years I have had a very nice drawing iPad app called Paper. Steve Jobs disdained styli On hte other hand many people gave up finger painting in elementary school, and using fingers is the alternative to using a stylus.The Pencil is not a dedicated device.

It is thick and has a nice heft to it, unlike may styli which are hollow and thin.If you are one who hates to use your fingers when creating art, the Pencil is an excellent choice.","rating":4},{"comment":"I left the pencil to charge overnight using my iPhone charger and all I got in the morning was just overpriced capacitive stylus.It took a while for me to realize that, because 53 software did not say anything and it looked like I paired the device successfully (no clear instructions provided regarding that).I tried every USB charger I have - the green\/orange bulb did not light up.Only after I dug op my elderly HP notebook and tried its USB output, the Pencil started charging.I think this should be explicitly stated in the instruction. Instead, they have USB wall charger on the picture that leads one to falsely believe it is possible to charge from these.Other than that, it works. But there's hardly any difference from any common stylus for 5-10 bucks, except eraser at its back and cool looks. I hope things will be better with iOs8 because they have some kind of new feature baked in for this OS.","rating":3},{"comment":"The first thing you do is take off the tip assembly and plug it into a USB port to charge for 90 minutes or so.  I can't say whether it would have been charged before that, because I walked away and only checked after more than that time had elapsed.  After simple reassembly, the pencil is ready to go.  It's meant to work with the Paper app, and that is where it functions the best.  With any other drawing app, it's pretty much a stylus and not a particularly great one.  Stroking is finicky, with a lack of sensitivity, especially to very light strokes.  The blend function sounds like a good idea, but it gave me trouble, blending when I didn't want it to.  I wasn't crazy about the tips.  They are pretty soft and mushy, and I don't have much hope for longevity.  I also have an issue with the fact that you have to remove your device's protective screen cover, allegedly because a cover will wear the tip out even faster.  This leads to smudges on the screen.You will probably like this better if you have used flat carpenter pencils in the past.  Personally, I'd prefer a round pencil stylus because that's what I've always used.  It's not that hard to get used to the shape, though and the balance is pretty good.  The main issue for me was the flimsy tips.  Also, the eraser installed on the pencil when I got it was coming off, and hard to get back in place.  This made me wonder about quality control issues.  So far this product has functioned pretty much as advertised, but has enough drawbacks that I'll probably be on the lookout for something different.","rating":3},{"comment":"My girlfriend is a professional character designer, so I thought the Pencil by FIftyThree would be a great accessory for her iPad mini.  Her usual set up is a Wacom Cintiq, or just pencil\/pen and paper when she's on the go.Setup was really easy through the Paper app; just one button tap was enough to sync up the Pencil unit with the iPad mini, and I haven't had any issues with connectivity since.  I had used the Paper app before, but adding the Pencil unlocked everything in the app.Despite the name, it really feels more like a thick brush or marker.  The main issue that my girlfriend has with the device is that it's so bulky that she doesn't feel like there's any precision to it, and she can't actually see where she's drawing.  In order for a stroke to register, you have to press down on the soft Pencil tip, which causes it to flatten out and block your view.Palm detection works if you're careful with your hand placement.  We've managed to accidentally switch tools and pull down the iOS notification tray while drawing.The Paper app is nice, but it's a little bit limited.  It'd be nice if they add support for line thicknesses on each tool.Pencil by FiftyThree is pretty nice if you want to paint and doodle on your iPad, but not if you're looking for something more precise for sketching.","rating":3},{"comment":"I've gone through a lot of different stylus types for my iPad, as I use it extensively to take notes for work meetings. I'm anti-paper and pro electronics, since I'm on the road a lot. Pencil and Paper, together, are the best I've found for taking stellar notes.Pros:- Stylus makes appropriate shaped lines, not weird bulky ones like other fat tipped styli I've used- I love that I can flip it to erase, and not have to use another &#34;tool&#34; in the software- It just works well. Comfortable to hold, easy to make the marks I want, and I don't worry about my palm making additional marks or swipes.Cons:- Connection is sometimes a bit wonky. I expect they'll fix this in future versions.I have no experience with using it to draw, as I cannot draw, and have absolutely no talent for that. My review is based solely on my ability to take notes, so I'm likely one of the lighter users of the system.","rating":5},{"comment":"I won't repeat all of the technical details which have been covered in other reviews but suffice to say, this feels like real wood and has a natural texture, good weight and resembles the old carpenters pencils of the past. On the other hand, the very thick point leaves a lot to be desired especially when trying to do detailed work...it's just plain counter intuitive to draw a thin &#34;line&#34; with such a thick point.Then there is the cost. Despite the fact I received this as part of the Vine program, the real functionality is associated with the paper app itself...the cost of this pencil device just feels high (very high) compared to the functionality which is essentially a glorified stylus.Battery life is okay - recharge is fast enough at about an hour and a half (90 minutes or so). I do like the feel other than the broad tip.","rating":3},{"comment":"I was looking forward to using Pencil after ordering it. I`ve been using 53's other product, Paper, ever since it was introduced as an app many years ago.  I must admit that the product's packaging as well as the machining of the device itself is exquisite.However, I think 53 made a mistake in the way they designed the pencil due to their criteria of embedding a USB battery charging connector within the pencil itself.  This decision means that the overall form factor would need to be based on that restriction.I think the pencil is too big as a stylus.  It could have been designed to be much smaller and lighter.  There are other ways of designing a charging connector that would have allowed for a much smaller form factor.What's most unfortunate is that by letting the USB charging connector ultimately dictate the size of the pencil, they made the sensing tip too big for any delicate work.  For example, when I try to draw a thin line across the page, it's difficult to judge where that fine line will end up exactly on the page.  It becomes almost impossible if you have to continue that line further down the page unless you magnify the area.  What they should have done was to design a thin pen and an even thinner sensor point so that users can match the tip to what's actually drawn on the page.  I would rather have a thin pen that could draw a thick line on screen than the thick pen that draws a thin line.The weight of the pencil is okay but I would have liked a lighter one.  The pencil lasts quite a few hours although I haven't been able to do a scientific test to see just how many from beginning to end.  The pencil does have a bit of a delay between when you draw or write something until it's registered onscreen. I'm not sure if that can be improved but it's more disconcerting when writing something than drawing something.  The eraser on the top of the pencil works great as advertised.Overall, I think this is a decent first effort by the team at 53.  It's a good companion to have with the Paper app, although it's a little pricy.  Let's hope that the next version would remove some of the constraints I pointed out above.","rating":4},{"comment":"I don't want to turn this into a review of Paper by 53, so I will just say about that app that I think it's good if you're willing to go along with what Paper wants you to do and not try to use it in some creatively different way. There is a promo video showing someone traveling and using Paper to draw images from their trip until they've filled up a whole virtual &#34;notebook&#34; in Paper, and then submitting the notebook to be printed into a real, physical book-ish thing, and that looks really cool, and if you want to do that it's a great idea. The problem comes when you just want to export the image...like if you wanted to doodle your ideas and then work on them further in another program later on your computer. Images export as .jpeg format and your options after that are going to be limited.Anyhoo...I'm kind of assuming you're not going to think about getting Pencil until you've tried Paper and decided it's fantastic or at least right for your needs. So in that case...This &#34;pencil&#34; feels really great in the hands. The graphite version isn't maybe as cool looking as the wood version but it has a nice weight and heft to it. I enjoyed drawing with it a lot, and I understand that it's not a pressure sensitive pen, which is something I WOULD like to try, but it's certainly possible to do quite a lot without pressure sensitivity and you may find you don't even think about it that much and just enjoy the different brushes.The packaging on this is very cool. I think it would make a great gift for anyone artistic. The battery lasts a long time and is easy to charge. I might give it five stars except I really want an oil painting brush and the most important thing: sometimes, even though the pencil is definitely showing as connected, the app thinks I'm using my finger for a stroke instead of the pencil (pretty sure that's what's happening) and I have to go back, undo, redo...it's a pain and gets in the way of flow. I'm using an iPad Mini with retina display, and it does seem to help if I reboot my tablet and make sure nothing else is running, but that little detail takes a bit of joy away from the tool.","rating":4},{"comment":"53 PencilThe beauty of the iPhone and iPad is the use of touch as an input device.  Whether navigating apps, typing in notes or drawing with the various apps, touch provides a viable and superior method for input. While there are a number of apps out there for notes and drawing, one that consistently comes out at the top of reviewer lists is Paper by 53, a free app that lets you use a set of built in tools to capture and create artwork using your finger or a stylus. In order to improve upon the user experience, 53 has brought out their own stylus &#8211; the Pencil by Fifty Three. Different than most styluses you will find, this one has a wood like exterior but is shaped not like a cylinder but like a rectangular flat carpenter&#8217;s pencil. Five and a half inches long, the Pencil features a soft rubber pad at the top, and the bottom end tapers to a point, like in a pencil. The rubberized end conceals a standard stylus tip that allows you to input on the i-device and works with all screens and apps like any other stylus. Grab the tapered tip and pull, and the inside of the Pencil is revealed. Inside are circuits and a USB connector to charge the Pencil. Open up Paper and you&#8217;re ready to see the specialization of the Pencil. Turn on Bluetooth on your device, open Paper and go to a new page. On the toolbar, press and hold on the icon of the Pencil to &#8220;kiss&#8221; or pair the devices. Now you&#8217;re ready to rock. The program recognizes your Pencil and opens up a series of tools for you. Often when drawing our palm rests on the page (or the screen) but Pencil tells the program to ignore those touches. You choose your drawing tool and just draw with the Pencil.  Flip it over and you can use the rubber flat end to erase &#8211; no need to choose eraser from the toolbar. Use your finger for input instead of the Pencil and it activates the smudge function letting you blend edges. In all your efficiency really starts to grow.I&#8217;m not an artist, but I found that drawing with the Pencil to be comfortable. It has a very nice hand feel, better than most round styluses. The usage of the Bluetooth sensor freed me up from worrying about input from my hand on the screen, making it a lot easier to work with. I didn't find it necessarily any easier to write with on my drawing, but when trying to sketch or paint, it did a nicer job than other styluses I tried or my finger. The big downside is that the bells and whistles beyond a basic stylus is limited only to using Paper. If you use the app, then this is something you may find useful. The other main problem of course is the price. You have to decide you want to invest in this stylus and invest in using Paper.  I did find the extra tools to be great and makes the Pencil stylus very useful.  You can do a lot more with it than with you finger alone. If you have taken the time to work with the app, you will find this to be a very useful tool in your toolbox. If you are looking for something to take notes with for work or class, save your money and buy a general &#8220;dumb&#8221; stylus.","rating":4},{"comment":"Overall, I thought this was a superb product.  The design of the tip pulling out and plugging into the usb port to charge is very clean.  The pen feels firm in my hands, but light.  I was able to draw quick sketches and send them off easily.  I only have two recommendations:1) Provide a carrying case, I'm worried about damaging the tips in my bag everyday.2) Remove the in app purchases for drawing tools and color mixers (cheap, but we already bought the product!)If you like to create content on your iPad, I recommend giving this a try!","rating":4},{"comment":"The company FiftyThree has a wonderful app on the App Store called &#34;Paper&#34;.  I love the app on my iPad; it's free to download (with some in app purchases) and allows you to create unique sketches.This product, Pencil, is intended to be the tool you use to enhance your experience with the Paper app.  When you download the app, you get access to a variety of colors and the standard brush.  But if you purchase and use Pencil, you automatically unlock all the extra app content - including a pencil tip, additional brushes, and a color mixer (value of $6.99).Outside of it's use with the Paper app, Pencil is essentially a fancy stylus.  The problem I have is that I personally find Pencil to be a bit thick for me and thus awkward to hold - I like my other micro-knit stylus set just fine.  And it does not seem that Pencil is particularly any better or worse than other styluses in terms of it's touch responsiveness or ease of use.So if you love the app Paper and want to support this company that is doing innovative things, then by all means purchase Pencil.  I received one for free to review, and I'm certainly glad I have it.  But if you already own a high-quality stylus that you are comfortable using, I'm not sure you're going to find Pencil to be any better than what you already have.","rating":4},{"comment":"Pencil is nifty.  I mean super nifty!  I love this little device.First, let me just say that I've tried other pencil\/pen devices for iPad and all of them required a bit of mental gymnastics before they could be used.  Not Pencil.  VERY clear and EASY instructions are provided for the device, making it a snap to set up.Once the Paper app is installed and Pencil is connected, the device gives great results.  Paper offers a myriad of selections, including pens, pencils, a paintbrush & eraser.  Choosing colors is easy as well.  And the results when using Pencil are just great!  Additionally, those who have Pencil have access to other options without purchasing them!I really like the eraser feature.  It is so easy to just flip the Pencil over and use the eraser rather than having to select the different function every time.Digital artists will love Pencil, and so will those who want to use it to jot quick notes.  In summation, Pencil is easy to use, fits well in the hand, and produces good results.  What more could you ask for?Charging the Pencil is a snap.  Just plug it into the USB port of a computer and it charges.  No need for a separate adapter!","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a beautifully crafted device and feels great in your hand, like the carpenter's pencil that it mimics. Clever hardware design and the weight balance is comfortable. Simple to use and fun for kids. I've found the pairing to be a bit finicky at times.","rating":4},{"comment":"Review of Pencil by 53Summary Version:If you are a fan of the iPad app Paper by 53 (and they are legion), then you may wish to seriously consider this stylus. You get an exclusive bonus feature enabled in the app in the form of a Blending tool, plus it unlocks the entire tool set, potentially saving you about ten bucks off the price of the app. The electronics give you an eraser at the end of the stylus and palm rejection (imperfect, but good enough for some). Build quality is very high, it has a pleasant, well balanced feel in the hand. Unfortunately this stylus is no more precise than your finger - something which can be said about most other stylus offerings to date (and perhaps all).Long Version (you've been warned!):I decided to review this Pencil by 53 stylus because I was skeptical of its utility, and curious as to why anyone would pay so much when there are many less costly alternatives. (Note that I did not pay for this - amazon provided it to me for free in exchange for reviewing it.) I also believe it is healthy to challenge ones prejudices and assumptions from time to time. I have used this for about a week, so do not have any factual information for you about the long term durability of this gadget - that being said it seems to be very sturdy and well built, so I expect it to last a long time. With those disclaimers out of the way, let the review begin!The fiftythree website says their stylus was inspired by the carpenter pencil, used by builders and makers for centuries. While I admire the marketing genius of invoking romantic, nostalgic feelings about this new product, I cannot help but wonder if there is some hidden truth here are well.  I happen to be intimately familiar with real carpenter pencils. I use them frequently when doing rough carpentry work, stuff that does not require much accuracy, but for everything else I choose a different, finer writing device. Perhaps 53 is quietly acknowledging the accuracy of this stylus is about the same as using your finger (as is the case with most or all other stylus brands today).Some Details:o I am reviewing the black Graphite Pencil, made of brushed aluminum. It does not have the magnetic snap feature that the wooden one does, so I shall not comment on that feature.o The stylus comes well packaged in a 1-1\/2&#34; diameter by 6-1\/4&#34; high sturdy cardboard tube.o There is a 1 year warranty, and a 30 day return policy.o In addition to the typical safety-related boilerplate that plagues all products these days, there are a few amusing words of advice. For instance you should never use Pencil while taking a bath! You should not eat this pencil, or it's battery. If you do, seek medical advice immediately. Good stuff here!o The electronic-based magic of Pencil is compatible only with full sized iPad generations 3, 4 and 5 (Air). Both iPad mini models are supported (i.e. generation 1 & 2).o You are advised to disable \/ turn-off the iPad's recognition of multitasking gestures and accessibility zoom.This is no great loss, as these things cause problems with other drawing apps as well.o This stylus is not pressure sensitive. It senses pressure as On or Off (i.e. touching or not touching the screen), with no graduations in between. So you will not be able to press harder for darker or thicker lines, for example. Of course, it's possible there is a gradient sensor in the device but the software in the Paper app chooses not to take advantage of it, only 53 knows for sure...This is a well designed, high quality stylus. There is a lot more good about it than bad, so let's get the bad stuff out of the way first.The Bad:o The cool electronics-based features of this stylus only work with the Paper app by 53 at this time (i.e. eraser, palm rejection). It will however work fine as a normal stylus with any app.o There is no storage case per se. Perhaps it is expected that one will use the high quality cardboard cylinder that the product is packaged in (that's what I've been doing).o Palm rejection - the holy grail of many stylus users - is imperfect. My understanding is that no stylus maker has yet achieved perfection in this area, and 53 is no exception. To be clear, 53 has done such a good job implementing this feature that I thought it worked perfectly for the first while, until eventually noticing two kinds of glitches.sometimes when writing text the character last written would disappear, to be lost forever (i.e. undo would not bring the strokes back). I believe this was the palm rejection algorithm deciding the strokes were illegitimate and hence wiping them from the drawing stack.sometimes small strokes would appear on the screen underneath the place where my hand was resting. I could live with this if the Paper app supported layers, as one could manage the amount of damage to the image by simply using lots of them. Unfortunately Paper has but a single layer, and the undo mechanism doesn't help much because one doesn't notice the artifacts for some time, as they are covered by one's hand - to undo an artifact one often has to toss a lot of valid strokes.The Good:o Packaging is very impressive, and commensurate with a high quality device. Instructions were clear and concise for initial setup. Battery is partially charged so the device is useable right out of the box (although I charged mine up before using it, as the instructions suggested). For full documentation, also very well done, go to the 53 website.o Battery life is up to 1 month on a single charge based on &#34;normal&#34; use. I have not used Pencil long enough to require a recharge, but can say the battery still reads full, even after many days of use. A full charge requires 90 minutes, but partial charges are fine and will not harm the device.o Charges on any standard USB port, including your iPad's charger. So no extra gear required above and beyond what you need for your tablet.o Feels great in the hand. The aluminum version has a pleasant textured, slightly rubber-like feel. It is a bit on the hefty side, which for me is a plus. On my kitchen scale it weighs in at about 35 gm.  The rectangular stylus is about 5-1\/2&#34; long by 5\/8&#34; wide by 5\/16&#34; high. Nice proportions for my medium sized hands, and I suspect it would be comfortable for smaller as well as larger handed folks.o Feels great on the screen. The rubberized tip has just the right amount of friction as it is dragged across the glass, slightly more than a mechanical pencil dragging across a piece of paper. I found it easy and intuitive to control.o Firmware in Pencil can be updated via the Paper app. A potentially great feature, as it leaves open the possibility of maintaining compatibility of the device despite future design changes by Apple. It also leaves me hoping that Palm Rejection might be improved.o All tools and features are enabled in the Paper app for free by virtue of using the Pencil. This potentially saves one about $10 - download the Paper app for free, link it to Pencil, and everything is automatically enabled. (Note that if you stop using Pencil with the app, these bonus features disappear after 30 days).o Pencil users have the exclusive privilege of using a feature unavailable to pencil-less Paper users, Blending by Finger (also commonly called a Smudge feature in other apps). This is a mixed bag. While it offers a useful new feature, I found that smudging often occurred when I did not want it to. Failing to press the stylus hard enough against the screen often resulted in a smudge, rather than a tool action. I suspect the reason for this is the sensor in the tip did not &#34;know&#34; the stylus was touching the screen and interpreted the capacitance as coming from a finger. Same problem occurs with the eraser. If this bugs you, the finger-smudge feature can be disabled. Or, you can train yourself to simply press a tiny bit harder when drawing. If you do this you may come to see this bug as a feature, allowing you to use the Pencil for both smudging and drawing. Either way, you are in control here, so I have rated this as a positive rather than a negative feature.o Battery charge level is displayed in the Paper app. Its always good to know how full the tank is.o The eraser on the top end of the stylus is cool. You really don't need it, as there is of course a tool which when activated makes the stylus tip act like an eraser. However, it is quicker and more intuitive to flip the pencil over and rub the eraser on the drawing to make stuff go away. Feels just like a Pencil!o Avoid screen protectors. I am delighted to see 53 recommend against using a screen protector with this stylus because it dramatically increases wear on tips, and interferes with touch detection. There is much misinformation and confusion about screen protectors and stylus use. Its refreshing to see 53 state their opinion clearly and unequivocally.o Pencil comes with spare parts, an extra rubber nib for each end, and clear instructions for installation.The Pencil AppSince Pencil is intimately tied to the Paper app, I think it's fair to mention a few observations about Paper that may help you decide if this Pencil-and-Paper combo is for you.On the plus side, Paper is a brilliantly designed and implemented app, whose prime directive seems to be replicating the artistic experience of drawing on paper in the most pure, most simple, manner possible. Beneath the apparent simplicity are very deep, subtle capabilities that allow advanced users to do extraordinary things. The color mixer is very impressive, as are other seemingly simple tools, once you know how to exploit their capabilities. See sebastiansdrawings website and download his free 62 page PDF &#34;cheat sheets&#34; for some excellent insights into the power of Paper.On the minus side, Paper's designer are perhaps too fervent about maintaining the purity of the drawing on paper paradigm. This may explain why the app does not provide important, time saving features such as layers, image import (for backgrounds), portrait mode (the app only works in landscape mode), and others. Some of the capabilities are relatively easy to implement, and given the great sophistication of the Paper app I can only conclude these have been left out on purpose. These omissions are so significant to the way I work, that Paper  is not my drawing app of choice, despite my deep admiration for it.For the vast population of ardent Paper users, I expect this seductive stylus will be an irresistible, useful enhancement to your drawing pleasure and productivity.Thanks for reading.","rating":4},{"comment":"Up to this point, I've been getting by with bargain iPad styli.  Pencil by FiftyThree is a big step up.With most apps (say, DrawFree), the Pencil is noticeably better than anything I've tried before.  The tip is finer, the carpenter's pencil style is easy to hold, and the back has a larger nub that makes an effective brush or eraser.I don't think the Pencil would be worth the price if that's all you intended, though.  It really comes into its own when working with the Paper app.  With the app, you can link the pencil, which gets you a selection of brush and eraser, in a very natural style.  Recommended if you're a fan of the Paper app.","rating":3},{"comment":"This is one of those products that you get so excited for in your mind but then turns out to be a major dud.  Here's why- The tip and eraser are no different than your normal 5 dollar squishy rubber stylus- The bluetooth connection is 100% dependent on the companion 53 Paper app - which by the way is so not intuitive, only works in Landscape mode, and only certain iPads (3 and above).- You have to charge the stylus for 90 minutes before first use- Removing the tip for insertion into a USB plug is a fearful act that you are going to break this overpriced stylus- The Paper app is kinda bad as it has no hand correction like Penultimate or any left or right hand adaptability-The bluetooth connectivity seems irrelevant for its purpose, my regular cheap stylus perform just as well or better so why is bluetooth necessary?- I have a 15 dollar Musemee Notier V2 that is way more accurate and responsive and works flawlessly with ANY handwriting or drawing app.Save your money and try something else.

It's striking to look at... just gorgeous!  It's also the first stylus I've used that works exactly like it's supposed to.  Pairing it to the iPad is cake, just launch Paper, touch the Pencil to the screen and it's done.Drawing with it is fun and feels more natural that trying to do so with your fingertip.  I have had a few instances where trying to use the eraser on the back doesn't function properly and have found that applying a bit more pressure with the back end of it solves the issue.The tip is removable and Paper supplies you with a replacement if needed.  Charing the Pencil is fast an easy through any USB port, and I've found I can go weeks or more in between charges!Apple's upcoming iOS 8 provides a bit more support for devices like this, so I'm excited to see how Pencil evolves.

All the tools of Paper App become available when this is connected.- Sensitivity is very good and I had definitely a good feeling while using this stylus.- Pressure sensitivity is missing, which is really bad. Not much fun with brush strokes.- Comes with an additional marker tip and eraser tip.- the tip tends to flatten out, so might be a bit tricky for complex jobs.- Can resist a toddler manhandling- Proves to be an excellent tool for a toddler to learn that iPad can be used for creation and not just content consumption.","rating":4},{"comment":"You'd think that the way the stylus works would be everything, but if you're using a stylus for any length of time, how it feels (an extension of you) becomes more and more important. The Pencil is easy to hold, silky smooth tactile sensation, and gripping it doesn't exhaust my hand.It's easy to recharge and holds the charge for a respectable amount of time. The point is a bit thick, so detail work isn't its strong suit, but that's a quibble. It goes from marker to pencil to eraser with ease - you can get quite creative with minimum effort.Yeah, it's on the pricey side, but for the pleasure you can get from ratcheting up your creativity, it's totally worth the expense.","rating":4},{"comment":"I have tried a lot of different styli  with Paper 53 so was excited to get the &#34;real&#34; one.  Well, it is no better than using my pinky.  It is impossible to draw fine lines, there is a slight delay (as with any kind of electronic drawing) and I had to push pretty hard to get lines - the tip is VERY VERY soft so I imagine it would not last long.  It comes with a spare.I give it a point for looks, a point for feel in the hand, and a point for the very clever way it is charged.  But as for performance, no stars at all.","rating":3},{"comment":"I understand why Steve Jobs didn't want the iPad to have a stylus - the stylus technology honestly hasn't come as far as the tablet technology has. Nonetheless, some of us want to experience the traditional tactile world of writing and drawing on our tablets. I have tried many different styluses (styli?), from the cheap amPen (not bad) to the pricier Adonit Jot Pro (excellent). I'd say the Pencil by FiftyThree falls somewhere in between.As a tool in FiftyThree (the app), this Pencil is a five star product. It is hard to describe how nice the palm rejection is. You simply tap to connect the Pencil and get to work with all of the great tools that the FiftyThree app includes. Every once in a while the app thought my wrist was the pencil and I had to erase a bit, but that's rare. More often, however, the app thought I was smudging when I was trying to draw. I found that this was related to my screen cover, when this was removed the Pencil never smudged instead of drawing, but it sucks that I can't have a screen cover with this stylus because I use a sticky permanent-type cover. The carpenter pencil shape is so comfortable and feels so natural in the hand. So is the ability to turn the pencil over to erase. The replacement bits (tip and eraser) and so nice to have.As a stylus in other programs, it isn't so great. Palm rejection doesn't work and the tip isn't at all precise. I prefer a precise point, which is why I rate the Adonit higher than the Pencil. You simply can't get the precise lines that you can get with a fine point stylus. The only way to get close is to zoom in on the page in FiftyThree.So when used with FiftyThree, Pencil is excellent. I love it for drawing up renderings for clients and drawing out ideas in my interior design business. But for note taking and writing, I will stick to my Adonit and a program with built-in palm rejection like Notes Plus.I already had the full FiftyThree program, including the upgrades, so the advertised benefit of getting the upgrades in the program didn't help me, but I would definitely suggest that potential buyers factor in the current cost of the upgrades into the Pencil. It makes it a much better value.","rating":4},{"comment":"The feel of the wood is lovely in my hand, and would suit a man's hand just as well, I think. I'm a real fountain pen, ink, and quality paper user, so digital tools that give me that tactile experience - while doing a perfect job - are top of my list!This stylus has beautiful wood grain, works perfectly on my iPad Mini (which has a ZAGG protective skin in place), and has a good balance in the hand.Previously I've used itty-bitty Palm-type styluses, an AmazonBasics stylus, and another $15 iPad stylus.

The Pencil, on the other hand, works well, suits my hand, and adds the pleasure of good design to daily tasks.","rating":5},{"comment":"I wasn't quite sure I would like this. I have several styli for the iPad and other screens. This one is different. For starters it is shaped like a flat carpenter's pencil. Second, the stylus is actively charged through a USB connection. (The tip slides out of the handle abd you plug that part into USB to charge it up.  Next, download the App by Fifty Three from the app store.  Instal and then you can create all kinds of things. Pictures, documents, notes, etc.  The pencil works quite well on other apps also.  The tip is a soft and spongy rubber.  The other end is an eraser.  In the 53 app, there are ways to select different type and size tips. This is quite a versatile tool and one that I will spend a lot of time using and exploring","rating":5},{"comment":"I love the &#34;Paper&#34; app, and have used a generic stylus with it many times. I was so excited when FiftyThree announced this product, and even more thrilled when I got to test one for review.It's very elegant looking and feels great to use. Great weight, great texture, looks beautiful. It links to the iPad through bluetooth, and there's a battery module inside that you charge via USB. In the package you get a replacement tip and eraser, and when you use this product you get all the in-app purchase add-ons available with Paper.In order to turn it on or off, you press the tip to a specific circle in the app. This activates the bluetooth link.Overall, when it worked right, it was great. But it was a little erratic in sensing the difference between the tip, my finger, and the eraser. This isn't a huge problem, because the undo function in Paper is very easy, but still, it was distracting and made the experience less pleasant than ideal. I am not much of an artist, though--I use Paper mostly to practice writing kanji, and occasionally doodle.Still, I love Pencil, and if you like the app and your iPad, this is one of the few add-ons that is equally elegant. Don't expect perfection, but it's a big step up from a generic stylus in my opinion, and it only gets better as I get more accustomed to it.","rating":4},{"comment":"[Good]It feels great.It looks great.It works great for the iOS Paper app. It also unlocks, the app's paid features.[Ok]Battery life is decent.I'm not too into the way you charge the pen, by pulling out one of the pieces. Since I don't know how this could be improved, I'm satisfied with the current implementation.[Bad]To my knowledge, this only works with the iOS Paper app.This is really pricey for something that currently only works on a single iOS app. Maybe this will change in the future.[Verdict]Try out the Paper iOS app. If you really like it and find it indispensable, then I would highly recommend this tablet pen.","rating":4},{"comment":"Pencil by FiftyThree is more than just a stylus. it is more like a stylus on steroids when paired with the Paper by FiftyThree app for your iPad.Pencil by FiftyThree is a tool that may have too much specificity with its functionality for some users. I can's see the average iPad user who just wants a stylus for simple note taking to get excited by this product - especially not for its relatively high price tag. but if you are an artist, designer, UI developer, or just like to sketch a lot of drawings from your ideas, this is a perfect gem.While some users have complained about its connectivity issues, I didn't have any issues. After downloading the Paper by FiftyThree app to my iPad mini and charging the battery of the Pencil i was able to open the app, tap the icon, and connect seamlessly. And with the sample electronic notebook that is included with the app, I was able to see examples of the Pencil's full functionality and coolness factor.Unlike other bluetooth styluses on the market, Pencil by FiftyThree doesn't use its enhanced capabilities to provide pressure-sensitivity in the app. Instead, the Bluetooth connection provides special features in the Paper app like palm rejection, multiple writing instrument styles, blending with your finger tip, and more. Unfortunately, these extra tools are for the Paper app only and cannot be extended to other apple apps. So, the Pencil become a regular, and very expensive, stylus outside of the Paper app.Some of the biggest pros and cons of buying the Pencil by FiftyThree are:Pros- Pairs instantly with Paper app after charging the Pencil- Outstanding palm rejection functionality- Very responsive - faster than other styluses- Great for accuracy and quick sketchesCons- Lack of pressure and size alteration for brushes- No special functionality outside of the Paper app- PriceIf Paper is your preferred note taking and sketching app for your iPad, then Pencil by FiftyThree is a clear winner. But for general use as a stylus, you may want to look for something cheaper.","rating":4},{"comment":"I have been looking at getting a nice stylus for my iPad Air for a while now, but was torn between the Pencil and the Evernote Pen stylus. I tend to do more writing than drawing, but I do love the Paper app by FiftyThree. I use it to take sketch notes during conferences.I took the Pencil with me to a conference last weekend, and it worked really well. The palm recognition worked well most of the time, but it did disconnect a few times, and I only noticed when my palm started making marks everywhere.The ability to just turn the Pencil over and use it as an eraser was also pretty cool. It was really a lot like using a real pencil.Overall, if you're going to use the Pencil for drawing (especially with the Paper app) then I'd HIGHLY recommend it. It's awesome.If you're planning on using it for writing or note taking, it may not be the best tool out there. I'm going to try the Evernote pen and see if that works a little better for writing.","rating":4},{"comment":"As someone who has larger hands \/ fingers, I appreciate the thicker size of this stylus \/ pointing device what is usually out there because it fits better in my hand.  I haven&#8217;t had the stylus miss yet when drawing a straight line, but it does feel a little weird trying to use the &#8220;eraser&#8221; part of the stylus.The pen came with an almost-full charge, and I&#8217;m not sure how long it takes to charge it: after a couple of afternoons of using it, I just start charging it overnight when I leave the office and pick it up again the next day.While the stylus feels great and works well, I think it is pretty pricey for what you get at $75: I would recommend sticking with a lower-cost alternative as the size benefits don&#8217;t outweigh me being able to purchase (and replace because I seem to misplace them) others for less than ten bucks each.","rating":4},{"comment":"I own a Wacom Bamboo stylus and an inexpensive Amazon branded stylus to use with apps on my iPad.  The Pencil by FiftyThree and the Wacom Bamboo are comparable by far to the much cheaper Amazon one. The Pencil was easy to use. It feels like a real pencil in your hand.  It's lightweight and sturdy. This is probably one of the best stylus for those who want a high end product with a lot of functionality.  Once the Pencil is synced with the app, it renders all other stylus useless.  The app will only function with the Pencil, but once it's unsynced, I was able to use my Bamboo.  A major highlight is you can order a hardcopy of each crafted book you create within the FiftyThree Paper app.  The downfall, that too is expensive at $40 per book.I rated it three stars (I would have gone to 3.5 if it were an option) because it's an okay product.  I liked it, but in the end, it's just a stylus.","rating":3},{"comment":"Great looking and feeling stylus, clever integration with the paper53 app, and even better with other drawing apps. Using this as a paintbrush in, say, Autodesk Sketchbook, feels very accurate because of the play in the soft rubber tip. It's the best looking stylus I've got, and I use it often, but it's not the ONLY one I use, nor my go-to favorite, however.Two thinks keeping me from giving it a five-star review:The feel of the tip could be improved. There is a gap in pressure sensitivity that doesn't quite match my expectations, and I find I have to press harder than I'd like to get a light brushstroke. Feels kinda slippery and imprecise at light pressure -- this is gone with moderate pressure. I would like to see alternate tips perhaps, or maybe a software update in the app that addresses this.Also, I really want to see more integration with other art apps.I recommend it, with the caveat mentioned above related to pressure sensitivity. Hope that is helpful!","rating":4},{"comment":"If you have any drawing\/artistic inclination then you have to get this Pencil. Even if you don't it's fun to use. I have drawn remodeling plans for my house, different ideas across multiple subjects and putting them on &#34;Paper&#34;... Their iPad app, which is great to use.So what is great about Pencil:It feels great in the hand, same as a carpenters pencilIt's sturdy and has some good weight but not to much.Easy to use with the app.Battery lasts foreverVery, very accurate.I feel the tip could be smaller as there is a good amount of space betwen the rubber tip and the actuator.However good the pencil is it would not be great without the amazing Paper app.The app is simple and easy to use.It's free regardless if you have a pencil or not.Can draw with your fingers.Lots of cool options and to start with.It does a great job at disregarding your palm as you grasp and use Pencil, which let's you use it in a natural form.You also get to see some public drawings that other users upload and these are amazing.A fun Pencil and Paper! Definitely a buy!!","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a beautiful stylus that is extremely easy to get up and running with Paper, which is a beautiful app.However, I find sketching with Paper (as-is, without paid add-ons), a bit frustrating and awkward for untalented people like me compared to some other apps.","rating":4},{"comment":"This stylus works best with the paper app by 53 while it still works with other apps like notability and such. The stylus I know since the beginning of the iPad era had two issues to my knowledge. One is the palm resting issue and the other is brush thickness control. Although this is not a pressure sensitive stylus, it is designed to have various thickness controlled by the stroke speed. (Edit: Surface Pressure feature will be available when iOS 8 coming out this fall.) Palm resting on the touch sensitive screen while using this stylus worked ok most of the time. It is not perfect yet, and there were times that the app preferred recognizing my palm instead of this stylus, but most of the time, it worked fine against my palm or part of the hand.Overall, this Bluetooth stylus is OK if you get used to it. The pencil is worth a try if you're illustrator or frequent drawer, I think. The performance of the product is somewhat inconsistent, yet it will work out fine if you are little bit patient and get used to the traits of this device. Here and there I encountered knick knacks, but these little glitches did not prevent me from disliking the product altogether.","rating":3},{"comment":"This is a very nice stylus, that is weighted perfectly to feel like a quality sketching pencil. You can use it as a standard stylus with any tablet. It works with my phone and with my iPad.What it's designed for, however, is the Paper by FiftyThree app. It's a very cool app, in which you can create a variety of notebooks and add sketches, drawings, watercolor style paintings, and notes. It's fun, and makes me want to be creative. You can do most things with your fingers, but for precision control in that app, you really need this pencil, that comes in both a walnut and graphite design.While it can work as a standard stylus without being paired, for full functionality you need to pair it to your device via bluetooth. One thing I really like is that it's easy to pair. You don't need to go into settings -- just open the \"Paper by FiftyThree\" app and then touch the pencil onto the pencil icon in the app for a few seconds and it will pair automatically.It does have to be charged, of course, and they claim that with regular use it should only need charging every month or so. I haven't been using it that long, but it does charge up fairly quickly -- in about an hour and a half. Another thing I really like is that for charging you don't need a cable. You just slide the tip out of the pencil and you can plug it in directly to any USB port and it will charge. There's a red light that indicates when it's charging and it turns green when it's fully charged.Once it's paired, within the app there are a variety of drawing and painting tools you can select by touching them, and then you can use them to draw, sketch, write, paint and erase. While you can select a very thick eraser, you get a much more subtle erasing effect by turning the pencil over and rubbing the back on the places you want erased.While the tip is somewhat thick, it can draw very precise and thin lines, depending on which tool you select. Its pen tool draws very thin lines wherever the very tip of the pencil touches the surface. You can blend colors, you can smudge them, you can do calligraphy style drawing, and more precise lined drawings. You can share pages from your notebooks to an email or to various social networks. Easy.I took off one star just because I have occasionally seen some quirky behavior from the pencil. It seems they haven't gotten all the kinks out. Every once in a while, for example, I'll have the pencil set to work as a pen, and I'll be drawing something and it will start smudging. I wasn't touching my finger to the tablet, but it smudged anyhow. That only happened a couple of times, but it makes me think that the other reviewers who reported similar behavior may be right: there may be some quirks they'll need to work out.On the whole though, I've been very impressed by this little device. It fits nicely in my hand, it feels relaxing to work with, and it's designed very thoughtfully. It's a very cool tool for a very cool app, and I know I'll use it a lot for fun and when I want to brainstorm imagery and ideas.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a stylus, and you can use it with anything. However you're not going to get anywhere near its value out of anything except the app Paper by FiftyThree. In that app, both ends of the pencil work correctly (draw and erase), you can place your hand at appropriate angles and palm-rejection kicks in. You can switch between the Pencil and your finger to switch between drawing lines and smudging their edges. It all works pretty well. Outside Pencil it still works as a basic stylus, but I rarely find a stylus valuable outside of a drawing app like Paper.","rating":4},{"comment":"The Pencil by FiftyThree is really a two part product - the pencil itself and the iPad app Paper). At $75, it's definitely a niche product. The Pencil is shaped like a carpenter's pencil and feels great in my hands. It's charged via USB (cleverly hidden in the pencil itself). The tip of the pen is accurate and provides enough resistance so it doesn't feel like I'm stabbing at my iPad's screen.It's important to know that the Pencil like most iPad styluses lacks pressure sensitivity. The Pencil connects via Bluetooth, and works fine on other apps (I plan on using this for OneNote) but you don't get the full benefit of the Pencil without its companion app. The app itself is free with in-app purchases, but to gain the full effect you need to spend $7 to get everything. Would have been nice if that was bundled with the Pencil itself.Overall I like the Pencil. It's a great stylus, but I wish I could use the app's features across all apps and not just Paper. If you're looking for just a general stylus, this is overkill.","rating":4},{"comment":"In short, this is mostly \"just a stylus\" with the ability to do a couple neat tricks when paired with FiftyThree's \"Paper\" app on iOS.  However, this could do a lot more, and the company promises it WILL do a lot more, once iOS 8 is released sometime in Fall 2014.  You should check out the company's website to understand how this will improve with the update.Here are some details...First off, the \"graphite\" version of this stylus is handsome, with a great feel.  The metallic body has just the right heft to it to make it feel substantial without being too heavy.Second, there are way too many app-specific stylus options out there, and I'm a bit frustrated that each of them is a \"basic stylus\" with the ability to do a few extra things when used with a particular app.  In the case of this pencil, the Paper app lets you draw with the pencil tip, and erase with the eraser end.  That's about it.  I do like that the stylus pairs easily with the app.  Just tap-and-hold the Pencil on the designated icon in the Paper app, and the pairing is done.  No fidgeting with Bluetooth settings is necessary (just make sure Bluetooth is turned on).Third, and I think this is really important: Right now (July 2014), the tip is just a tip.  But FiftyThree says that with the release of iOS 8 in the fall, you will be able to get different artistic effects depending on whether you hold the stylus straight up and down, or at an angle.  That will be an impressive improvement.  If it works as promised, I will owe an update to this review, because the Pencil will have taken on a whole new level of usability, and may end up feeling more like a real pencil.  But for now, the tip is just a tip.Finally, understand that you may need to buy replacement tips and erasers for this device.  Typically, I think of a stylus as a device that does not have consumable parts.  However, FiftyThree makes it clear that regular use requires replacement of the rubberized ends: an extra tip and eraser are included in the packaging (and more are available for purchase).As a basic stylus with a little extra functionality when used with the Paper app, this Pencil is a bit overpriced.  However, I will need to rethink that statement if FiftyThree comes through with its promised functionality when iOS 8 is released.","rating":3},{"comment":"I am an amateur connoisseur of styli and other input devices that go along with tablets.  I've owned many different types of which I cannot remember.  Up until this one, my favorite was the Cosmonaut.  But this is my new favorite stylus.  What makes this one very awesome is the Paper app that Fifty Three makes.  I've used Paper for quite while now and this is the best notebook app on the iPad.  This stylus makes it even better.  I love that in order to charge this stylus, you don't need a separate cable or plug.  Their ingenious design lets you just slide out the charging component and plug directly into your laptop\/computer for charging.  Its a joy to use.  I've been through a ton of styli and this is my favorite.  The fact that there is an app just for this stylus makes it completely awesome.  With the app, you can use the eraser as you would normally do with a pencil.  I've also read that this stylus may even get better with iOS 8 - you will be able to make thin or thick lines with just how you press the pencil against the tablet.  All in all, a great pen that is boosted to 5 stars b\/c of the Paper app.","rating":5},{"comment":"As you would expect, the 'Pencil by FiftyThree' is a great looking stylus. It's comfortable and just feels right while gliding smoothly over my iPad's surface. When combined with Paper by FiftyThree it really shines by adding two new features: automatic palm rejection (since it 'knows' that the surface of the pen is in contact or no) and the built-in eraser.It's a bit gimmicky and in my opinion unnecessarily complicated. While palm rejection and erasing are nice I haven't really felt the need for them. I'm also not an exclusive Paper user so the extra cost of this stylus isn't that easy to justify.It is nice that the extra tools in Paper are unlocked and free when using Pencil but I think it would have been more reasonable to just unlock them for free when users purchased Pencil.","rating":4},{"comment":"I have absolutely found my favorite drawing stylus, hands down, I can't rave enough about this one. I do have several others including the Wacom Creative Stylus (which is quite good and works with several apps now that the app makers have programmed in support for it). But the Wacom is restrictive on how you hold it in order to work the buttons for erasing, etc. This new &#34;Pencil&#34; by 53 is pretty much perfection. Here's why: in order for you to draw and paint seamlessly so you don't even realize that you're on a device and not paper, the stylus has to feel like the real thing and not need special button-pushing, etc. PLUS, the app has to be completely integrated to work with it, but not only that, the app has to be so good at what it does that you can't wait to open it to start drawing, even if you use your finger. THAT'S why this Pencil is so good. I've been using 53 for a couple years and it is, hands down, my favorite creative drawing app. You just have to see it for yourself and the base version is free (the in-app upgrade is worth every cent however). Then out of the blue, 53 comes out with this Pencil and I leaped to get it and am thrilled with it. The weight, first and foremost, is so real and the stylus is so balanced, it's like using a real art pencil. The tip (or &#34;nib&#34;) is absolutely butter smooth on the screen, and I do have a protective clear sheet on my iPad screen. And because this Pencil integrated with the 53 drawing app and it knows you're using the Pencil, you just draw without having to click or hold down buttons, and then when you need to erase something, you do something crazy: you turn the Pencil around and use the rubber eraser on the other end, JUST like a real pencil. No buttons to push, no tool on the screen to tap, you just use it like a... pencil. Finally real drawing has arrived and it does take a collaboration of app and hardware designed together. It's worth its price, absolutely, and does come with spare nibs, although I can't imagine them getting too worn down on the slick iPad screen. If you know an artistic person and want to buy them a gift, give them one of these and tell them to get the app, and you'll see a big smile come from them once they try it. Gee, think I like this thing??","rating":5},{"comment":"FiftyThree's Paper is one of the best drawing apps for the iPad, being very simple and yet capable of rich creativity. It's that simplicity that makes it so fun - your tools are limited to a small number of drawing styles (pen, pencil, marker, watercolor, etc.) - and line weight is controlled by the speed at which you draw. It's this last aspect that many saw the Pencil tool that FiftyThree created as having more control over, probably due to expectations set by Wacom's long-revered line of pressure-sensitive drawing tablets.Let's cut to the chase: that is not how Pencil works. In fact, Pencil functions mostly as a typical stylus, which do have their merits over simply using your finger. There's no pressure sensitivity available (more on that in a moment) but Pencil does open up one capability that your finger cannot. When paired with Paper (by poking the tip at a circle in the tool drawer of the app), Pencil is the input device while your finger is a smudge stick. Draw a line, lift Pencil from the screen, and you can then smudge that line into a blurry mess, much the way one can with a line drawn on real paper, but this works for all tools in Paper. It also includes a handy eraser on the end opposite the tip.Pencil is beautifully designed, shaped like a carpenter's pencil (wide and flat on two sides, with a chisel-shaped tip) and, in the case of the model I have, crafted out of rich walnut wood. It's a pricy joy to hold and use. Pulling on the tip reveals a thin plastic case inside, the heart of Pencil where the battery and electronics are stored. One end of this terminates in a USB plug, from which the built-in battery is charged. The rubbery tip is removable and replaceable, as is the eraser, and the attractive cardboard tube the Pencil comes in contains one extra of each.But back to pressure sensitivity, as promised. FiftyThree has just announced that with the upcoming iOS 8 for the iPad comes the ability to enable pressure sensitivity. This is a game-changing feature that will make the Pencil a must have, transforming what is an exaggerated stylus into a truly useful tool, and a feature that will likely be built into, or activated in other styli. At that time, I might consider updating my review and, hopefully, adding 2 stars to my current 3 star rating.","rating":3},{"comment":"I never thought I could get excited about a stylus, but Pencil by FiftyThree is an exception.  I am using FifthyThree with my Windows 8.1 laptop and my Asus Transformer (Android).  FiftyThree works great with both devices.  I haven't tried this device with an iPad, but I can say it works well with both Windows and Android.  According to the Pencil company, iPad users can download special software to improve the functionality of the FiftyThree.  I'm happy using it as a regular stylus with my other devices, but I hope they release a version of their software for Windows and\/or Android.The FiftyThree feels awesome in my hand.  I have the graphite version and it has a cool feel to it.  It fits nicely in my hands and using it feels intuitive.  My devices respond nicely to my taps\/gestures using the pencil.  I didn't have to install special software to use the FiftyThree.  It simply worked.  Charging the device is easy since it can be plugged into any device.I suppose the FiftyThree is a bit of a lavish item, but it is a dream to use.  I had read about this product a few months back and was really excited to try it out.  I was not disappointed and recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great stylus.","rating":5},{"comment":"By far, the Pencil by Fifty Three is the best stylus I've ever had the pleasure of using. Regardless of which device I use my Pencil, it works silky smooth and with great precision. I've used it on my Windows Phone and my Kindle HD tablet with great results. I borrowed an iPad mini with the Paper app and just fell in love with the interactivity the Pencil has with the Paper app. (It almost makes me want to buy an iPad just so I can use this app!)The Pencil is very well built. When you use it, you can appreciate the engineering that went into making this stylus. The smooth graphite metal body is cool and silky to the touch. The rubber tips do not drag. The design aesthetics are perfect too. The pencil appears as one unit, but it is really several pieces precisely fitted to give the Pencil a single whole shape.Pencil by FiftyThree is worth every penny regardless which device you use, but it's an even better buy if you can use it with the Paper app for iPad.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Pencil stylus is hands down the best stylus I have used with any tablet. The carper tee pencil shape takes a bit to get used to, but it is a good design offering a variety of grips. This one, the graphite model, is a shade heavier than the walnut, giving it a solid feel - with the trade off of the comfort of wood and the walnut's magnetic ability to stick to an iPad and some covers. The tip has enough give to make it very nice for writing and drawing. Paired with the free Paper app, the Pencil shines - you can use the eraser like any eraser and easily access a host of app features. Together, that makes the Pencil and Paper combo the best solution for notes and art on the iPad.  The only choice is graphite or walnut.","rating":5},{"comment":"This pencil goes along with the Apple program called paper.  It is truly a lot of fun if you are into sketching or drawing.  But the average person who is not into that will be disappointed.  I have a wonderful relative who loves to sketch and I plan to tell her about it because I think she will love one. I did not have the problems with the erase feature as some of the other reviewers have mentioned.  It always worked fine.  If you have young children they will love it.  My only problem is the price.  It is quite expensive for what it does, but then a lot of products like this are.  My husband loved the fact that it looks like a carpenter pencil and I liked how easily it is to maneuver because I have arthritis in my hands.  Just be prepared to pay a high price.","rating":3},{"comment":"I use the Paper app on my iPad a lot as a portable whiteboard, and looked forward to trying out this stylus designed specifically to work the the app.First, the setup was great (after I figured out how to charge the Pencil). There&#8217;s an icon in the app that you just hold with the Pencil, and you&#8217;re off and running. Being able to flip it over and erase something is absolutely great, and it worked for me pretty reliably. However, as advertised, this feature only works with the Paper app.One of the things that makes it look like a supermodel, is that fact that there are no LEDs or ports on the exterior. This becomes a bit of a drawback when it&#8217;s time to recharge, as you have to disassemble it to charge it.As noted in the product description, the iPad Mini w\/Retina does not have a strong enough magnet to hold the pencil. That was a bit disappointing.Overall, I think you would need to be using the Paper app with high frequency to justify the purchase of this Pencil.","rating":3},{"comment":"I actually really do love this product. The software, not to much.The things I do like about it:* The stylus is comfortable to use and a nice weight.* It is versatile with the Paper app and makes the app easier to use* If you have a usb port, it can charge.Cons-* I did have a short period of trying to connect it, but it only took a few minutes* I do wish it connected to other drawing apps, or at least Paper available on other devices* It would be nice if it came with a caseIf you have the Paper app, I do recommend purchasing the Pencil. If you do not have it, you will be left with an expensive stylus.","rating":3},{"comment":"This was my first experience using a stylus with an iPad and I have to say that this pencil has a very good feel in general. The tactile sensation and the weight in your hand is nicely balanced and the rubber tip has just enough friction on the surface of the iPad to make you feel like you're &#34;writing&#34; without necessarily dragging too hard or too strongly.I tried this both as a control device (which is good if you don't want to use your fingers or are clumsy or find things too close together) and in the Paper53 graphics application. As a simple pointing\/tapping device, it works on all iPads, but the Paper53 application which expands on its capabilities only works on newer devices that can run iOS 7. I was rather disappointed with how it worked in the graphics app because it seemed that it responded to angle\/speed more than pressure. When I pressed down with the stylus, the line width did not change. It did change with a dramatic move at an angle, often times in opposition to what I'd expect with a real writing implement. I sketched a cat and, if I quickly stroked upward with a pencil to draw a whisker, I'd expect the end to taper off and get thinner as the pencil whipped off the page. With this stylus, the ends grew fatter with the gesture.I've used graphics tablets (Wacom) before and know that drawing on devices is something you often need to learn how to use as they don't respond the same way as traditional media. However, I'm simply not prepared to re-learn how to draw to suit the way in which the pencil works. It's a well-designed device. It is packaged beautifully, feels lovely, looks good, and has an all-around sophistication to it that cheaper devices do not (though, as someone else said, the long-term durability of the rubber tip is something I'd worry about as it feels like it's a relatively thin cover over a harder implement). However, when drawing with it, either because of the application or the way the pencil worked, I wasn't satisfied with its performance sufficient to view it as worth the price tag.","rating":3},{"comment":"I got Pencil by FiftyThree in hopes that it would be an excellent stylus and replace my current cheap one.  It has become part of my everyday office work.  It works wonderfully with my iPad for just about anything.  I use it when browsing the internet, jotting down notes, and sketching out ideas.  The bluetooth feature that works with Paper, is amazing as well.  It ignores my hand, and just allows me to sketch with the pencil as well as easily erase with the backside.  The bluetooth takes just about 30 minutes to charge and is normally good for several hours of constant use.The only challenge with this product is the price may keep many people away.  However, in my experience if you are looking for a top notch stylus, then this one is hands down a great choice.  The pencil also comes with a replacement tip and eraser so it should last for a long time.","rating":5},{"comment":"I already had Paper by FifttyThree, but I hadn't played with it much. After a few minutes with the stylus, I was hooked. So much more fun than using your finger in this app - and much more precision. I was able to make images I don't think I'd pull off with pen and paper and it's very relaxing to use. The grip is perfect and the stylus is perfectly responsive.After an hour of doodling, I made the in-app purchase in Paper to buy the whole package. The default free fountain pen tool is still my favorite, though.I'm able to use this to sign my name, save it to my iPad as a PDF and use it in documents. Love that. I can't sign my name that pretty with an actual pen!It charges easily via USB and frankly - I just love this Stylus and Paper. Love, love, love, love!I get totally immersed with Paper using this stylus - I can literally paint\/draw\/doodle for hours. The very easy 'rewind' feature in the app lets you go several steps back if you realize you need a do-over. Using this stylus and this app is so relaxing - it's just awesome.","rating":5},{"comment":"I received this Pencil by FiftyThree - Graphite through the Amazon Vine Review program.  I was very excited to try out this product, but sadly, I was left disappointed.The stylus connects to my iPad (4th generation) through Bluetooth.  Connecting by Bluetooth is not seamless, like it should be.  I usually have to reboot the iPad, the Pencil, and sometimes both.My major disappointment is that the Pencil currently only works within their own app.  I was hoping to use this in iPhoto and other iPad apps that I frequently use.  Hopefully this might be supported in future updates.  I've read that after iOS 8 is released (sometime this Fall) that the Pencil will have greater functionality.","rating":3},{"comment":"I had installed the Paper app by FiftyThree some time ago, and I liked it, but the lack of tools other than the pen and eraser made for a limiting experience. Clearly, the freemium model is in play here, where you can try out the app in a limited form for free and in-app purchases enable more features.In addition to the in-app purchases of additional tools, such as Color, Sketch, and more, you can enable these tools by buying the Pencil tool, which is the subject of this review.It is shaped like a carpenter's pencil, which makes it easy to hold, but the aluminum model that I received is a little on the heavy side. There's a fine balance between being too light to be useful and too heavy to be fatiguing, and I would rather it lean towards the heavy side, so I'm sure that it's a matter of getting used to.The tools work really well with the Pencil. Enabling the device to activate the additional tools is easy. After charging it, just pressing the Pencil to the round icon inside the program pairs the Pencil to the iPad, with feedback given along the way. Even when not paired, the Pencil still acts like a stylus, so it can be used in any app.I can see how something like this in the hands of a skilled artist would be quite valuable. Since I'm not a skilled artist, all I can do is the equivalent of scribbling compared to what is displayed on FiftyThree's web site. If you are a skilled artist, this device will make the Paper app much more useful. Even if you aren't skilled, it's fun to play around, and maybe with enough &#34;scribbling&#34; you might improve your artistic tendencies.In addition to this aluminum device, FiftyThree also sells one made from Walnut for more money. I can see how a wooden device would feel even more natural, and its lighter weight (26g vs. 34g) might help in that regard as well. Whether that is worth the extra money is up to the purchaser.","rating":4},{"comment":"I will start out by admitting that I am not an artist, yet I know my way around a stylus. The Pencil by FiftyThree is a very attractive and easy to hold stylus whose rubber tip glides just right on the screen of my iPad (which has a 3M screen protector - the instructions recommend not using a screen protector but it seems to work fine for me.) Unlike many other iPad styluses I have used, the Pencil's design makes it easy to control and to make delicate motions.The real star here is the Paper app - at least once you figure out its unusual user interface. It doesn't help that the instruction leaflet packaged with Pencil is incorrect as far as how you &#34;connect&#34; the Pencil to Paper, and the user interface is so opaque that I had to watch half a dozen tutorial videos at the FiftyThree web site before I started getting the hang of it. Contrary to the leaflet, the connection &#34;target&#34; is not displayed on the main screen - you have to tap on the &#34;53&#34; button and then go to Pencil to get to the right place. Another leaflet packaged with Pencil is labeled &#34;Product Manual&#34;, but it's just warnings of what not to do, the warranty and disclosures. I have yet to find any document that could truly be considered a manual for either Pencil or Paper.For a Bluetooth stylus, the Pencil does very little with BT. As other reviewers note, it isn't pressure-sensitive, and I haven't yet found an action where pressing the tip to the screen has any specific function. The only thing I see is that if you flip the Pencil around the other end serves as an eraser. There's no way to control line width using Pencil other than speed of your stroke. However, I read recently that iOS8 will enable Pencil to register its tilt to adjust line width. This seems rather error-prone to me, but maybe folks will get the hang of it.The Paper app is truly wondrous, once you figure out how to use it and to bring back the palette and controls, which hide themselves too easily. Using a Pencil gives you free access to many of the features of Paper, otherwise you have to buy them. I had lots of fun mixing colors and experimenting with different stroke styles. Paper comes with lots of examples of what talented artists (read, not me) can do with the app.","rating":4},{"comment":"This stylus feels great in your hand, has better performance than most, and is certainly better than using your finger, but the performance is somewhat inconsistent.  In general, the performance is best in the Pencil App, but some of the issues permeate across uses.  The battery charge is inconsistent, lasting disparate amounts of time from charge to charge.  There are frequent missed strokes, where the iPad doesn't even register what you just did with the stylus.When the strokes were being registered and the battery was staying charged, this stylus performs well.  The only improvement (besides improved reliability) that I'd like to see is for it to be pressure sensitive.  That shouldn't be too much to ask for such an expensive stylus.","rating":3},{"comment":"The idea of using a stylus appeals to me. I'm not an artist, but I like doing quick sketches to capture and explain ideas when I have a paper notebook. I've been searching for a stylus I like. Independent of how Pencil works withe the Paper app, and from a form perspective, Pencil works well. I like the way it fits in my hand, and it is a great stylus in it's own right, though perhaps a bit expensive for a stylus. When connected with paper, the little things it adds, like being able to erase by using the back of the &#34;pencil&#34; are wonderful. The problem is that I found the Bluetooth connectivity iffy. Almost every time I tried to connect Pencil with Paper, I needed to reboot Pencil, the iPad or both. I have seen similar problems with other Bluetooth devices, but having to reboot the device each time I want to use it adds a fair amount of drag if you are using Pencil + Paper casually. This may be less of an issue for the more dedicated user. While the connectivity still needs work, Pencil is one of the better styli I have used, and when paired with Paper, it makes using a stylus for sketching and occasional note-taking even more appealing.","rating":4},{"comment":"When used with the Paper by Fifty-Three app, Pencil is the best iPad stylus I've ever used.  It can be a bit finicky to get working, but once it is, it really is the closest thing I've ever felt to just drawing on a tablet.  Physically, the stylus feels properly built, unlike some, where it's felt like the rubber tip is always just about to rip off and leave who knows what scratched across my iPad's screen.  The squared-off shape is easy to hold, and it just feels solid all the way around.Previously, the best stylus I had ever used was the Cosmonaut, which is built like a big crayon and felt that way when drawing.  The Cosmonaut works well, but doesn't fit my hand in the same, precise way as a pen or (real) pencil.  Pencil does.  Combined with the special features it has--flip to erase, palm rejection, essentially getting free in-app purchases with the Paper app for extra drawing tools--it really works well when you want to sketch something out on the iPad.It is not perfect, however:* It has to be recharged.  Unlike most styluses, which are just not-quite-pointy sticks of rubber and plastic, this one connects via Bluetooth and has to be charged.  So far, it doesn't have to be charged all that often, but you may have an idea for sketching something and not be able to sync with the Paper app because you need a recharge.* The neat features are finicky.  I particularly like the idea of treating the rear of the stylus like a pencil eraser and erasing when it is used.  In my experience, this feature works almost, but not quite, all the time.  Sometimes, it still thinks you're trying to draw.  (I've never had it go the other way, where it thought I was trying to erase when I was trying to draw.)  Blending with your fingers seems hit-or-miss, too--again, it almost always works, but occasionally not.  The good news is that palm rejection seems to work without a problem.* Right now, at least, it is utterly dependent on the Paper app on the iPad.  If you try to use it with any other app (or with any other tablet), it works fine, but all the neat advertised features won't work at all.  Supposedly, there is some effort to try to get other app developers on board, but there are no other apps that use the special features that I've seen so far, and I'd recommend not relying on that hope when making a buying decision.* You also need to have the right iPad.  The compatibility list (iPad 3, 4, Air, Mini) isn't for show.  The syncing and special features do not work with an iPad 2 (or, presumably, an original iPad).  It still works as a dumb stylus, but it's too expensive to recommend without its special features in the Paper app.In sum, it's a really nice drawing stylus (with a few quirks) when used with the Paper app, and a good, solid (but expensive) stylus when used with anything else.  It makes me wish I had a smidgeon of artistic ability, but it helps me get the best out of what little I have.","rating":4},{"comment":"'Pencil' feels just like a good old fashioned carpenter's pencil. Designed to be used with 53's Paper app, it enables both drawing\/writing\/painting and erasing that otherwise you have to do by hand (or with another stylus). However using 'Pencil' unlocks additional features that otherwise are paid in-app upgrades\/purchases (it connects to your retina iPad via Bluetooth LE--low energy).The Walnut Pencil is well designed; it's made from real wood and feels well balanced. The nib and eraser are softer than they look, and perform better under a light hand. Pushing too hard will probably shorten their useful life, but at least they can be replaced. It's easy to charge as well.Pencil did not make me a better artist, and I think at $75 it is probably aimed at Paper power users. For someone that uses the Paper app a lot, Pencil is probably invaluable. But for occasional use it's pretty expensive.","rating":5},{"comment":"I own the JOT Touch, Script, Pro and Mini.  Each one served a purpose and was a great stylus.  Regretfully all of them except for the Script have been thrown into a drawer never to be used again.  Why?  After reading the dozens of reviews on Amazon about how they scratch screens, I am not going to risk using them any more.Pencil is a great stylus and you know the tip won't scratch your screen being made out of rubber.  It's added functionality in the iPad App Paper makes it really nice for sketching.  Paper isn't very good for note taking though.  With no image import or support for text, it makes it is kind of useless for my purposes, unless I just want to doodle.One downside with the Pencil is no pressure sensitivity.  Not that big of a deal for me, but I wanted to point it out.It does work well as a normal stylus in other apps like Notability, Inflow Plus, Adobe Ideas, and Penultimate.  The only problem with that is I don't need to pay $60 for a normal stylus.Overall I like it for what it is made to do, it just does not do enough for me.  I like the weight, I like the tips, I like the erase function of the Pencil, I like how you charge it and how long a charge last.  For the artist I see this being a big win.I am giving it 5 stars because it does what it says it does and it does it well.  It is also made with high quality material.  Over all I think this is a great buy if the functionality it provides is what you are looking for.","rating":5},{"comment":"Love it....what more can be said.Going to make this short and sweet.1. Remove the electronic components from the pencil (slide right out) and plug into your computers USB port so the pencil can charge.2. Download the Paper by 53 App from the App Store (we used it on an iPad Air).3. Start using the pencil.**Make sure you turn bluetooth on your i-device on.  Once bluetooth is on and you launch the Paper application there is a spot to tap and hold the stylus on so that it will make a connection with your device.  You now gain advanced functionality in the Paper application.Test scenarios for us:Doodling - Drawing - Sketching - we all used it at home for some fun - nothing technical and it did a great job.  It was fun.Math Test Studying - my highschool son, a junior, had a math final and decided that he would like to use this to study (instead of scrap paper).  He used the Paper app as scrap paper and was easily able to draw graphs and write out formulas...EXCELLENT.This was a major hit in our home.....I have recently read a release from FiftyThree stating that once iOS8 is released in the Fall that their application and the Pencil will support pressure sensitive use.  In other words...when sketching if you press harder you will get a darker line...etc....EXCELLENT in every regard and can only get better with updates to the application.","rating":5},{"comment":"I'd wanted this stylus for a long time but opted for the Wacom Creative Stylus instead.  The main advantage of that stylus is that it can used with a larger number of apps, although not all it's features are available for each one.  To get the main benefits from the Wacom however, one has to use Bamboo Paper (which stinks) or Sketchbook Pro.  The Pencil by 53 works best with Fifty Three Paper, which (like Bamboo Paper) and allows you to create a collection of virtual sketchbooks.  The Pencil is more comfortable to grip than the Intuos Creative and has a rechargeable USB battery while the Intuos takes an odd and expensive battery size.  What's disappointing about it is though it can be used in other apps, it's features will only work in Paper.  In paper not all of the tools are pressure sensitive with this stylus--only certain ones, the eraser works with everything though and if you hold the stylus sideways you can smudge certain media with your finger like you'd smudge pastels or charcoal pencils in conventional art media.  I like this stylus very much, what I don't like is the fact that Fifty Three Paper is an app that does not to be fully mature--you can't change canvas sizes and it doesn't support layers.  Some art purists may prefer this because it's more like drawing with real art media--but it's not Corel Painter by any stretch of the imagination.  I think Fifty Three needs to add an acrylic or oil brush the art tools, also allow for true zooming instead of having to use a loupe--but if you want a more true to life drawing experience you'll like this combination--just don't expect to be able to output images that you can blow up to a decent frameable size or use for commercial purposes.All in all drawing on an iPad is a disappointing experience since Apple does not yet support a more Wacom like hard tipped stylus for artist endeavors.  The Pencil is about as good as it gets for a spongy capacitive tipped stylus.","rating":4},{"comment":"I'm surprised by how much I like this pencil. The software was easy and contains everything I needed to complete a few home improvement projects. The pencil is an extremely nice stylus as well, so I keep it charged and handy pretty much all the time.Originally, I wanted something like this to use to draw plans for my paneling I wanted my husband to build in a long hallway. I drew a picture of what I wanted and he made his &#34;improvements&#34; and added measurements. It is quite cool that the pencil comes in the shape of a carpenter's pencil. My husband had zero issues getting used to it. We have a history of arguing over lost plans on paper so having them on my ipad is fabulous. (I am convinced he &#34;loses&#34; my plans so he can do what he wants.) I was able to save the file as a PDF and send it to my artist son for his input.I look forward to using this for our basement remodel.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is an amazing stylus, with beautiful aesthetics and a nice flow. I love the weight of it because it feels good, with most other stylus designs either coming in light or really, really light. As far as any other IPad stylus is concerned, I am thinking this may be the best one out there. The stylus is a bluetooth device, synching with the IPad, and it makes loading in Paper really easy. It responds well but it does not have pressure sensitivity, which is a downside but one that will hopefully be overcome in the future. It also has some issues now and again with being moody, hence the loss of a star because moodiness plus price sometimes irks people. That said, I do like it a lot and hope that it is taken to its full potential soon.","rating":4},{"comment":"My friend and I had so much fun trying this out! First, the stylus is beautiful and well thought out - even down to its packaging. It looks impressive even in its cylindrical box. The pencil itself is also stunning and feels wonderful in hand.

You're worth it!Well done!","rating":5},{"comment":"I've tried a number of styluses (I know, but I used &#34;styli&#34; in the subject) on the iPad.  I've tried to be happy when them, and I felt like I mostly was, but the truth is none of them on a long enough timeline felt right.  What I wanted was the familiar feel of a #2 wooden pencil, with all the precision and control that goes with that.  That's *not* what Pencil is, but Pencil *is* as close to that experience as I've enjoyed so far.  Much more like (indeed, nearly exactly like) holding a carpenter's pencil, you'll be surprised just how much the feel of the real wood in the outer shell gives this a great in-hand feel.Charging is easy -- the tip slides out from the bottom revealing a USB jack.  Plug it in, and that's the extent of it.  The tip itself isn't the finest of points, but it's smooth and nicely rounded, and the pressure sensitivity sensor hidden inside doesn't betray or befoul the motions involved with using this as one would a more traditional implement.The bundled\/free iOS software?  &#34;Paper&#34;?  It handles basic sketching very nicely, it enjoys a fantastic implementation of watercolor-like brushwork that is unique to this app (at least in contrast to the 8 or 10 others I have and use on that device).  It's highly intuitive, clever in terms of its presentation and organization (as a series of sketchbooks) -- it's just not as feature and function-rich as others like ArtStudio, SketchBook Pro, and Procreate; each of which more a shot at a portable Photoshop alternative.  But, Pencil works beautifully which each of them, and as a general purpose stylus -- it simply shines in FiftyThree's Paper app.It's a great piece of smart and pleasing engineering, a pleasure to hold, and a pleasure to use.  I'd still love to see a slimmer #2 pencil version with a finer point, but this is the first time I've come away from a new stylus thinking &#34;this is great&#34;, rather than, &#34;this is great, but...&#34;  Highly recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"After researching many laptops on Amazon I narrowed it down to this baby.

Other than that, Inateck's matches Amazon's almost feature for feature:- Magnet keeps it closed.- Built-in sensor will turn the Kindle on whenever you open the cover.- Textured surface guarantees a good grip when holding it.- Front cover folds back for one-hand reading but it's not as flexible and pliant as Amazon's.Considering that Inateck's currently sells for less than half the price Amazon charges for their premium, ultra-deluxe cover, it's not a bad alternative. Truth be told, as much as Inateck's emulates Amazon cover's design, you will know and feel that your cover is a cheaper version of Amazon's original, especially when attempting to fold back the front cover as it constantly fights you, trying to revert to something close to an 'open book like' position which is not good. On the other hand, it's as light and protective as Amazon's.____________________________________________NOTE: At the time I posted the review, Inateck cover's price was listed at less than half of Amazon's.

The only real differences are that the Amazon case is slightly thicker (so perhaps provides ore protection) but it's pretty negligible.

This may sound like a small detail, but the interior of my car is black and gray. When I want to glance to see if I left anything behind, it makes it easy to spot. My previous black cover often acted as a camouflage disappearing into the dark of the floor.A very nice cover.I received a complimentary sample to test for my review.EDITED -DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME! This weekend, after my granddaughter was swimming, I helped her in, leaving my Kindle outdoors. Shortly after, we had a storm. The next morning, I discovered my Kindle still on the porch.

After using the Inateck case for some time I realize the additional bulk  and things like hand straps provided by the Marware case is not necessary with the newer Paperwhite models.  They are so light that it is far better to use this extremely light and slim case to both protect my tablet and provide a save and secure grip.  Now, back to my original review...This case is a sharp contrast to my previous Kindle case, theMarware Eco-Flip.  That case had elastic ties, a hand slot, a slot for credit cards, a secret grip, and cost over twice as much.Truth be told, using it with my old Kindle Touch required either the hand slot or the secret grip because that eReader felt a tad bulky.  What I've discovered with my PaperWhite is that when its in this case I can hold it effortlessly without all that paraphernalia.A couple other thoughts... Because the case is from fitted to my Kindle it holds it more securely than the corner elastic bands on my Marware case.  Finally, the case automatically shuts off my device when it is closed.That makes this case perfect.  It is held closed with a simple magnet and my Kindle is well protected.

My daughter has coveted it for a while, but they are pricey so we just haven't gotten around to purchasing one for her. When I saw this cover, I knew I had to have it for her.What a great deal this thing is! The price is amazing for the quality. No, it's no QUITE as good of quality as mine is for my Paperwhite, but this thing is really close. Compared to the Amazon one, this one would work just fine. Mainly because most folks upgrade every two or three years and this cover should last at least that long, if not a little longer. I was really surprised at the quality for the price and, honestly, next time I need to order a cover for my own, I'd look at this company. You can't beat the bang for the buck or the quality.Of course, the sleep mode and turn on feature are always appreciated. I guess I have fumbling fingers because I can never find the little button, especially in the dark (and I read a LOT at night). Honestly, my daughter nor I can remember the last time we had to find the on button for my Kindle because these covers have us totally spoiled.As far as protection goes, it's sturdy, has a nice soft interior (that doesn't seem to shed, I have been using it for a month now and no shedding yet - will update it if it starts doing it, but my experience has been that it usually starts right away).Highly recommended for those with a Paperwhite looking for a good, sturdy protective cover (the fun colors don't hurt either!).

Whether or not you'll want one of these cases for your Paperwhite will depend greatly on if you travel with it.The case is very well constructed and appears to be durable.  The back of the case is a form fitting plastic shell that the Paperwhite snaps securely into and the front is a hinged magnetic cover that opens like the cover of a book.  There is a magnet in the cover that will turn the Paperwhite on and off when it is opened and closed and the inside of the cover is a nice, soft material to keep your screen from getting scratched.  The device fits very securely into the case to the point that it can be a bit of a struggle to remove the device once it has been snapped into the cover.While the cover is pretty light at about the 3 ounce mark, it still does add approximately 50% more weight to the non-3G Paperwhite which is a very noticeable difference.The real question for me comes down to whether or not you need a cover for your Paperwhite in the first place.  I do a vast majority of my reading at home and have a safe place to stash the device when not being used so for me the answer is probably not.  My wife, on the other hand, takes her Paperwhite back and forth to work and she has found this cover to be an excellent way to keep her Paperwhite from getting damaged while it is inside her bag.If you're reading this review you're probably looking for a way to protect your Kindle Paperwhite and there is no doubt that this cover will fit that bill nicely.I was provided with one of these covers for the purposes of doing this review.","rating":5},{"comment":"This Paperwhite cover gives a wonderful, secure fit and it holds the Kindle in place without any slippage or sliding.

I feel like a magician when it pops out!This envelope case coordinates perfectly with theInateck felt notebook sleeve]Inateck provided a sleeve for evaluation and review.","rating":5},{"comment":"I've had myKindle Paperwhite, Wi-Fi (Previous Generation)since it was first introduced in Sept 2012. A couple of months after receiving it, I purchased theAmazon Kindle Paperwhite Leather Cover, and I've had that cover protecting my Kindle since that time (about a year and a half, at this point).That Amazon cover is now showing wear, with the edges fraying slightly, but in all other respects it still looks very sharp, and it has been a completely satisfactory cover for my use, which I would say is not rough service by any stretch of the imagination. It has provided good protection, is attractive, and does not add significant bulk or weight to the Kindle. I like this style of cover, and I would not want to use my Kindle without this protection.This Inateck cover is very similar to the Amazon cover I've been using, but it is even lighter weight. I weighed both covers on a simple postage meter scale:- Amazon Kindle cover approx 5 oz- Inateck Kindle cover approx 3 1\/2 ozDimensionally the Amazon cover is about 3-4 mm wider, and about 3-4 mm taller than the Inateck cover (see my comments below regarding the plastic base plate designs of the two covers). I could not measure any difference in the depth (thickness) of the two covers. The Inateck cover 'feels' thinner but this may be simply because of the different feel of the material, and also because of the fact that it is noticeably lighter.Functionally the two covers work exactly the same - the Kindle snaps securely into the plastic base plate, which protects all four sides of the Kindle as well as the back. The cover then closes and will remain shut magnetically, folding open and behind the Kindle when in use. The magnetic latch both holds the cover in place, and serves to put the Kindle to sleep, or wake it up, as the cover is opened and closed. The cover fits squarely and securely when closed. The cut-out at the bottom provides plenty of access for the charging port and on\/off switch. I do notice that the finish at this cut-out area of the Inateck cover is somewhat rougher than around the sides of the cover base, and it is not as smoothly finished in this area as the Amazon cover.The materials of this Inateck appear to be very good quality and the feel of the cover is very nice. It does not have the same leather feel of the Amazon cover, but it does have a good quality feel and style. I like the inner surface of the cover, which is microfiber, better than the Amazon cover which is fabric. I also like the fact that it does not have the metal latch cover that the Amazon cover has. The Inateck name is embossed in the cover but is not too obvious; likewise, the inner surface of the front cover is embossed with Inateck's website address, even more subtly done and almost unnoticeable.The poly carbonate plastic base plate designs of both the Amazon and the Inateck covers are very similar, but the Amazon cover is noticeably thicker on the sides than the Inateck, and it is stiffer and more resistant to bending. The Amazon cover base plate's added thickness is at least partially due to what feels like a rubber piece that is glued seamlessly to the plastic base and provides a good shock absorption capability on all four sides. The Inateck base plate feels like a typical light-weight flexible plastic piece, with much of the stiffness probably coming from the PU leather covering that is glued to the back of the cover. When they are compared side-to-side, the difference between the two base plates is very noticeable. I think that the Amazon cover will almost certainly provide better impact absorption and protection than the thinner Inateck design.Durability of this cover will need to be experienced over time. As I mentioned, my Amazon cover has frayed slightly in the year and a half that I've used it, but in all other respects it is still very sharp looking. This Inateck cover does show creases at the hinge when it opens, not necessarily indicating any tendency for wear, but it is a slight difference compared to the Amazon cover.Where the Inateck cover has a significant advantage is price - it's currently selling at $15.99 here on Amazon, compared to $39.99 for the Amazon cover. I actually paid less than the regular price for my Amazon cover because I was lucky enough to get it as a Gold Box deal, but even then my price was $23.99 (for black only at that price). At normal day-to-day prices, the Amazon cover is very significantly more expensive than the Inateck cover.The Amazon product is priced at the premium end for Kindle covers, but there are plenty of other choices available in addition to the Inateck, including quite a few other covers priced similarly if not cheaper. A quick search here on Amazon will give you a wide selection; here are a couple, as just a sample (I do not have any personal experience with any of these other covers myself):-Fintie Folio Case for Amazon Kindle Paperwhite and All-New Kindle Paperwhite- available in several different styles, and less expensive than the Inateck case (as low as $9.99), depending upon the color and finish selected.-MoKo Cover Case for Amazon All-New Kindle Paperwhite- the 'slim shell cover' style is similar to this Inateck cover, and is priced as low as $11.99, with other styles as well as a variety of colors available.The Inateck cover is presently available in only 4 different colors, far fewer than most other alternatives including the Amazon cover (7 color choices). I have the blue color, which is more of a grayish blue than the illustration suggests. I like the color and it's a nice change from the black of my old Amazon cover.I'm using this Inateck cover on my Paperwhite now. If I needed a new cover for my Paperwhite today, I would give this Inateck cover serious consideration, although I would look closely at the other similarly priced covers before making a final choice.As detailed above, the Amazon cover does have a heavier and more protective base plate and sides, and it is finished slightly better than the Inateck cover. It is a leather cover which helps to explain the higher price. It is well made and a good choice, keeping in mind that it is priced at about $40, which is a lot especially considering that the Kindle itself can be purchased for just slightly more than a hundred bucks depending upon the configuration of Kindle you select. If I routinely dropped my Kindle, or if I felt that I needed more assurance that the cover would provide a certain level of protection for the device, then the better protection of the Amazon cover would help justify the higher price. If you read some of the reviews to the Amazon cover, you'll see that some buyers feel it is too heavy or bulky. I have never felt that way in using it for a year and a half, and now after scrutinizing the Amazon cover closely in doing the comparison for this review, I understand why that is.Bottom line for me - this is a very good choice for someone wanting a cover to provide basic and minimum level of  protection for their Paperwhite, who does not abuse their Paperwhite and therefore need a more protective cover, and who likes this style of cover design. I think that it deserves 4 1\/2 stars, because of the light base plate design and uncertainty regarding long term durability. I'm giving it a provisional rounded up 5 star rating for now -- and will return to update this review if I find any signs of wear or deterioration over time.I did receive this cover from Inateck for review purposes, without any promise to give anything other than my honest evaluation, which this is.","rating":5},{"comment":"Like so many things in life, I prefer my Kindle naked. I have tried using the Amazon Kindle cover and even a rubbery sleeve from another vendor, but I found that all of those options add too much weight and bulk to the Kindle reading experience. When the Kindle is by itself, it feels almost weightless in my hands and I really love that--I can disappear into what I'm reading about. This flannel\/felt sleeve offers the perfect protection for my Paperwhite when I'm not using it (and when I want to throw it into a bag or something). The little faux leather strap is great too--it works as a lever from inside to push the Kindle up when I'm ready to read. If you like your Kindle bare, this is a great little accessory for making sure it stays clean and moderately protected.UPDATE: I have been using the product for a while now and am still very happy with it. It's just what I wanted. The reason I'm writing is the company that makes this product. I was given a sample product for review by them, which I did. I gave it what I thought of as a very positive, 4-star review. Immediately, I was contacted by a company rep who requested that I change my 4-star rating to 5-stars. This bothers me because I thought I was given the product to try and then give an HONEST review. The fact that the company interferes with the star rating one would choose for a product makes me question their other 5-star reviews, if they were given freely, or were coerced. And I can't even imagine what would happen if I had given a 1- or 2-star review to the product. So, I'd just advise other Amazon shoppers to take any glowing reviews for this company's products with a grain of salt. That said, I am VERY satisfied with the sleeve.","rating":4},{"comment":"Inateck Compact KPW Envelope Case Cover Sleeve Carrying Protector comes in nice soft gray felt with white stitching trim..My KPW fits snug..Has a nylon insert that you pull the Velcro closure and it slides it right out of the case..Has a brown leather Velcro closure to keep it safe..This case is recommended for people who read their KPW bare with just a screen saver...I personally like mine in a case at all times because it will have RTC protection just in case I drop it while reading..Sample provided for review...","rating":4},{"comment":"Amazon's official Kindle Paperwhite is quite a bit more expensive, so does this lower-cost version match up? Not so much...Pros:1.) It's cheap!2.) It's actually a little lighter than Amazon's official case.3.) Easier to take Kindle in and out of than Amazon's official case.4.) Sleep\/wake magnet works perfectly, 100% of the time.Cons:1.) It feels very cheap. The materials and build quality just doesn't come close to Amazon's case.2.) The cover scratches ridiculously easily. This may not bother some people, but I don't personally enjoy cases that get trashed easily. Running some keys lightly over the exterior of the case left scratches and scrapes all over it. My Amazon case doesn't have any indication of use, despite much abuse it's been subjected to. Keys don't phase it! D'oh! Even your fingernails will scratch the Inateck case!3.) The cover can be ripped without much force. In fact, to properly test this product, I gave it a quick yank where the back and front meet, and whoops - the whole thing ripped into two pieces. I don't expect many people to test this, but it's something to bear in mind if you're getting this for young children who tend to be not as careful as adults in their handling of electronic devices.Overall, the Inateck Compact Kindle Paperwhite case does a decent job of protecting the Paperwhite itself. It won't win any awards for build quality, but if you need something cheap to throw in your bag, and you don't care about its physical appearance after a bit of use, it's hard not to recommend.3.5 stars out of 5.For reference: I received this sample for objective review.","rating":3},{"comment":"I really like my Jebsen tripod, and my Samsung phone fits in it nicely, even with the thick phone cover that I use. I make sewing tutorials for my blog, and this tripod really does the trick for table-top photography. It's highly poseable and easy to maneuver.","rating":5},{"comment":"I use my phone to video record my songs as I'm learning them on my guitar and ukulele, so I'm always trying find ways to prop my phone up while I record.  This little tripod is the perfect solution!  I just slide my phone into it and clamp it down, then I either adjust the legs to prop it up on the coffee table or twist them around my mic stand - voil&agrave; - I'm recording.I have used tripods like this one for my GoPro when I'm paddling on an outrigger canoe - it's perfect for wrapping around the ama (the support arm for the pontoon.)  This type of tripod is pretty waterproof so it's great for using on a canoe, but since I don't have an otterbox for my phone I probably won't try using this rig on the boat.This is really nicely designed, easy-to-use phone stand AND it's a great price.  Kudos to the folks at Jebsen for putting it together.","rating":5},{"comment":"The build quality on this is surprisingly good considering the price. I also have a Joby and, while the articulation action on the Jebsens is a little less smooth than the Joby, the range of motion is just as good. Each of the legs can be positioned in any number of ways, allowing you to stabilize your camera regardless of what it&#8217;s placed on.There&#8217;s a ball and socket joint at the base of the head that allows for tilt adjustment. That&#8217;s the most significant variance from the Joby in that the ball and socket on this one is very tight and can be hard to move and fine-tune.The base of each of the three legs has a non-skid coating that works very well. It stayed in place even when positioned on a steeply tilted surface.The tripod connection at the top pops off for ease of attaching to the camera. To remove it you push down on a plastic tab and pull the screw attachment off. There&#8217;s padding at the base of the shoe (it feels like it&#8217;s made of silicone) to protect the camera and keep it secure. While the plastic tab release tab is a bit lightweight, it seems sturdy enough for normal use.While the action of a Joby is a bit smoother (especially with the top-most ball and socket joint), this is nearly as good and, at the present price, costs less than half as much. I think it&#8217;s an excellent value for the price and easily earns 5 stars.[Sample provided for review]","rating":5},{"comment":"Pretty good. Not wonderful. It's a little lighter duty than I would have liked and it's a little longer and more difficult to find a place to store it than I would have liked.

Recommended!","rating":5},{"comment":"If taking photos or video with your smartphone, this tripod is a really great and cost-effective option - it includes a special clip that securely holds your phone.  Another possible use is to simply use the tripod to hold your phone for video viewing.  One example is having the tripod on your desk while watching a video lecture on your phone - the tripod holds the phone so that your hands are free to take notes, etc.The tripod is similar in design to Joby's Gorillapod series.  The legs have many joints that allow it them to be moved and twisted in all sorts of ways.  You could even wrap the tripod legs around another support structure.One important thing to note is that this tripod is small and light, this makes it very portable.  But it also means that this tripod is NOT meant for large cameras - I tried placing my DSLR on there just to see what would happen, and the tripod couldn't support it.  It might work for some lightweight point-and-shoots, but I wouldn't count on it holding for very long.I received a free product for testing\/review purposes.","rating":4},{"comment":"I love that this came with the top piece too, I didn't need to buy it separately.

Additionally with the added function of a remote shutter release via mobile phone app, I find myself wanting to position the camera low and on the ground, but not \"on the ground\" as in touching the dirt and getting damaged. I am the person who this tripod is made for, and I really like it!It is very durable and the legs are very firm in flexing. I had no concerns-- they easily hold up my camera. The mounting base was well designed and includes a small tacky rubber grip to keep the camera from sliding around as you maneuver the legs. I really liked this added touch.  The one thing I would change though is that it uses a standard coin turn style screw head on the mount. Many newer tripods have a triangular flip tab that flips down and allows you to screw it without the need of tools or coins while you're on the go. If they could add this feature I would be in love!Fully recommended. I have attached a photo.By a lot of hard hours and days and years of time spent reviewing, I found myself in the top 10 reviewers on Amazon. This wasn't a goal or self promotion, but by nose-down focused reviewing.

This is one of those products. I assure you that I review what I want, when I want, how I want, in order to share what I feel is the most accurate useful information.","rating":4},{"comment":"I really like the versatility of this stand.

Like the Survivor, it has two layers of protection. The Bolkin has a hard plastic frame underneath a thick silicone outer layer.Pros:--Unlike a folding case, it is easier to access camera to take pics, without a flap swinging or in the way.--The buttons to get to home screen, volume, and on\/off are much easier to access than with folding cases, where they tend to be more recessed.--Super protection in case of accidents. I work with kids on the autism spectrum, and I would recommend a case like this for anyone with special needs who may be prone to accidents or bad tempers.--Sturdy stand for hands-free landscape-viewing.--Cheaper price than Griffin (or Otterbox).Cons:--A lot bulkier and heavier than Griffin Survivor. I would prefer a lighter case.--Cheaper screen. I can see fine lines on it.--Bolkin screen affects sensitivity, especially near the top, closer to the frame. Sometimes I have to press a few times to get it to respond.--The sound is affected--not so much the volume, but it sounds like there is a \"coating\" that adds a bit of cloudiness to the sound, which is especially noticeable with music.--More attractive contrast colors to Griffin selections.Overall, I like it, but am not dazzled. I would like to see them improve the clarity of the screen, fix the sound problem, and make it lighter.3.5 rounded up","rating":4},{"comment":"the screen protector has a bunch of visible vertical lines in it. i tried cleaning it, but this did not help at all","rating":1},{"comment":"This case was sent to me no cost for an honest review. Because of this I&#8217;m not sure if it was not sent with instructions on purpose or if it regularly ships with no instructions. I did figure it out but it took me a while and that was frustrating.Compared to some of the other iPad cases I&#8217;ve used this one was not the easiest to install. Even when I did figure how to install the case, it was not easy. The plastic case is easy enough but the rubber outer casing is the issue. You have to figure out (on your own) that the small notches on the plastic casing must line up with the holes in the rubber. This wasn&#8217;t easy either because it seems you have to install the rubber casing BEOFRE you place the top plastic covering on the iPad&#8230; all while trying to line up the rubber holes.Once I got the case on I found it did a pretty good job of protecting my iPad. It is a bulky case but any case that claims to be &#8220;shock-proof&#8221; isn&#8217;t going to be thin. I would not use this as my everyday case though. For me this would be a vacation\/let the kids use it on special occasions case. I would not use this case at work.This case also isn&#8217;t flush with the iPad. The rubber on the back does not form to the plastic and neither does the rubber around the case. I realize this is a personal preference and it won&#8217;t matter to everyone. It matters to me. Yeah I&#8217;ve been spoiled. I&#8217;m not going to carry around a sleek device in a non-sleek case. There are too many choices where you can get both.If you&#8217;re looking for a case that will protect your iPad and you could give two craps about aesthetics, then I highly recommend this case. It IS good and it DOES protect. Very well.But if you&#8217;re looking for a case that looks good AS WELL as protects, there are better ones out there.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a protective case for the iPad 2,3 and 4. I received this as a review sample. I'm testing this with my iPad 3.The case is in 3 parts. There's a bottom and top made of hard plastic and a silicone cover that binds them together. The fitting is good. All the apertures are in the right places and the buttons and ports can be accessed easily. The transparent cover is sensitive enough.Testing: As this is a test product, I went to town on it and basically did a lot of drops with the case. The case itself handled the drops well, the plastic did not crack and the silicone corners did a nice job of softening the falls.As far as the iPad goes, shock is still shock. Even when shock is attenuated by silicone, it's still shock and that could loosen connections inside the iPad. There is only so much a few mm of silicone and hard plastic can do, so careless handling just because the iPad is protected by a protective case is not recommended. Instead, I would say that a case like this would help lessen and decrease but not eliminate the effects of hard drops.Thoughts: It's a good looking case. It's functional and protects against accidental drops and scratches. There's even a flip out stand in the back so you can stand your iPad out.Anyone who is prone to dropping or otherwise harming their iPads should definitely consider getting something like this.","rating":5},{"comment":"I got this for my ipad 2 last week.  I thought it was easy enough to figure out and install over the ipad with no instructions and the buttons and protective screen all line up perfectly and work just fine for me.  I don't have to do anything different at all compared to my bare ipad.  The case adds a small amount of additional weight to the ipad, but not enough for me to consider it a downside.  The kick stand works well thus far and seems sturdy.  It's also nice to have the case come in different colors.  I was thrilled to be able to get it in purple.","rating":5},{"comment":"Couldn't find any &#34;perfect&#34; case for an IPAD I've looked at them all!  This IPAD is for a 2 yr old, so it needed to be rugged, have clear front protection against a possible spill of a drink, wanted a front hard cover, and be able to stand up on it's own.  The latter only in landscape mode on this case.  But considering no more expensive cover anywhere has all that I wanted, I opted for this cheaper version that gets me most of what I needed, at a cheaper price than other more expensive ones.The extended rubber corners would seem to protect against drops very well, the additional &#34;rubber&#34; is something I particularly liked when looking at reviews, and something I like a lot after putting it together.  Haven't tested a drop yet, don't intend to, but it would seem to take a lot of the shock if dropped.The front cover plastic does not sit perfectly on the IPAD glass.  There is a small gap that is somewhat annoying, but my 2 yr old doesn't seem to care, so whatever.  I even put an additional protective cover over the glass for additional protection, AND to try to &#34;raise the glass surface&#34; in an effort to get the &#34;gap&#34; out.  It helped a little, but the gap is still noticeable when pressing on it.  At least to me, not so much my 2 yr old.  : - )  This is a pretty common problem with integrated front transparent covers.  I've seen much worse, and I've seen better.  This is in between.  And both transparent covers together haven't diminished the touch response at all.  I typically do this for additional protection with all my phones and IPADs.Even with the small gap, I still wanted the integrated clear cover because it is glued to the plastic, in case of a spill, liquid should not make it into the case... theoretically... I'm not saying it's waterproof, but if it buys me 10 seconds to sop up a spill, it would have done it's job, so it's something I wanted...  However, the included transparent cover was scratched up pretty badly, it comes with no &#34;protection&#34; itself, unlike the clear covers you buy that have protection on each side until you put it on... so it was very scratchy and doesn't appear to be very clear, right out of the box.  And though that impacts the clarity of the IPAD to those who know... it's really only noticeable when it's off and reflecting off a black screen.  When the IPAD is on, it seems fine to the novice user... you can't see the scratches, etc when on...  and is especially fine for a 2 yr old.  : - )The case went together pretty easy, even with no instructions, piece 'o cake.About the stand, I don't think it will last long.  Pretty cheap plastic, but what I expected, so I'll make it work for as long as possible... another thing I didn't like about this case is when the kickstand is out, the back of the IPAD is exposed.  Not a huge deal if everything stays together... but if the stand should ever break off, which I'm betting will happen, the back of the IPAD is going to be always exposed... to dirt, dust, anything it sits on or in.The buttons work fine, everything matches up really well.  Easy to charge with the small opening at the bottom.And for now, after a week or so, so far so good.It can't stand up in portrait mode, and some games are in portrait mode.  But it's a sacrifice to get the other things I wanted.Again, I knew what I was getting, so it suffices for now.And in the meantime I'm still waiting for the perfect case.","rating":3},{"comment":"My son received an ipad 4 for Christmas, and almost immediately dropped it and cracked the screen.  It still works, so I didn't send it in for repairs.  I was looking at Otterbox ipad cases to protect what's left of his very expensive gift.  But at $50+ I hesitated.  Then I had an opportunity to test the Bolkin Hybrid Armor Series Shockproof Case, and hoped it would do the same job as an Otterbox.I am happy to report that it's every bit as good as the Otterbox cases I've examined, and about half the price.  It has the same little cut-out openings for the camera, microphone and ports.  It's got the same little buttons covering where the on\/off buttons are, and one cutout area for the rotate lock button.  It's got the same clear plastic protector for the screen, leaving a crystal clear view and no lessening of touch sensitivity.  It's got hardened plastic corners and back ( shockproof, to protect against Christmas Day breakage), and soft silicone sides that are comfortable to hold and provides a safe grip to the user.  It's got the same little stand on the back to prop up the ipad.It took me a couple of minutes to pull the case apart, insert the ipad (making sure the camera and ports were matched up with the holes) and then fit it back together, but once it's all clicked together with the tabs, it's securely (but not permanently) shut and protecting your ipad.  It also comes in a variety of colors, although we got the black one.I unhesitatingly recommend this Bolkin case, and really why pay double just to have the name Otterbox on your case?","rating":5},{"comment":"I've tried a number of cases for my iPad 3, with varying results.  Some were too clumsy, some were not protective enough.  I was happy to be offered the opportunity use and review this one, and I have to say, I really like it.The case is well made, it fits nicely although it's a bit tricky to put on (the case comes in 3 pieces), and the screen protector doesn't diminish the ease of use or visibility, except at the extreme top or bottom of the screen, and there only slightly.  The buttons are where they're supposed to be, and work just fine -- no fumbling, etc.  The stand works well, and provides sturdy support, and the soft silicone case makes it comfortable to handle and use without the stand.  I did try a drop test from 30 inches onto a hard clay tile floor (I figured if it failed, I'm about due for a new iPad anyway).  No problem at all -- the case did what it was supposed to do.There are a few issues that may or may not be deal breakers for you.  It's a bit bulky, which limits the places where I can safely stash it for carrying around with me.  I have a shoulder bag, and my iPad usually fits in the side pocket perfectly.  Not so with this case. Another issue for me is that the stand allows for use in landscape orientation only.  I do a lot of work with music scores, paper crafts designs, etc. -- and I need to be able to use my iPad in portrait orientation.  Some cases allow for this by the use of a swivel and\/or a two-part stand mechanism.  This is a design issue -- not a quality one -- so I'm hoping that we'll see a later version of this case that incorporates a way to use the iPad vertically.  And this case certainly isn't the only one with this issue.  Is it a deal breaker?  Only you can decide.That said, it is a very nice case, and I really did like it.  I'm planning to purchase several of these for gifts for family members.  It comes in a great range of colors, and is, I think, well worth the price.","rating":4},{"comment":"There are so many iPad cases out there and I've seen many that are flimsy cardboard or have metal hooks that don't hold or are simply poorly made.  This Bolkin hybrid has complete and full protection and has a nice sleek look to it.Simply wrap the back cover (which has the stand that only rests horizontally) around your iPad and then wrap the outer (colored) shockproof silicone case around it.  It fits snugly.  Then attach the outer front plastic aces.  It fits over your iPad and clips into the sides and has four tiny clip inserts that hold it securely.  The plastic cover window is cheap plastic, but it disappears over your iPad and enables your fingers to work the iPad very well.  It also is well attached to the plastic frame so that if you spilled liquid on it, it would not slip under the plastic frame.This is a great bargain and a good way to protect your very expensive iPad.

This is the best case I have had.  It thoroughly protects my iPad from all angles; it even has a screen protector as part of the case!  Although the screen protector sometimes causes the screen to look slightly blurry, this is fine with me if it offers protection from fingerprints and scratches.  The case allows for access to all buttons and doesn't block the sleep button the way some other cases do.  It was easy to insert the iPad into this cover and it is holding up well.  It even protected the iPad when it was thrown across the room once.  I can't ask for more from a case!Sample provided for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"The case itself is very good. It goes on quickly and offers a good degree of protection. Putting it on the first time might not be intuitive, but once I showed my wife how to do it, she was able to do so quickly. The case will protect an iPad from minor to moderate falls. Its stand is practical and functional.The screen protector itself doesn't match the quality of the case. It serves the purpose of protecting the screen, but doesn't offer the full sensitivity or clarity found in other products. You won't have the same experience you expect from an iPad outside of the case. Yet for practical purposes, there will be circumstances when you will want to use it.The case has openings in the right places for standard buttons or connectors. But there are external devices such as plug-in card adapters that won't attach when this case is on. That's likely to be an issue with many cases though.The case might have been worth the price with a better screen protector, but with the one supplied I couldn't justify recommending it at the $64 price. I wouldn't consider it worth more than $25 at most. I still plan to use it for many everyday tasks. I wouldn't want to watch a movie with it on though.Note: I was sent a sample of this product but did not promise a review in exchange.","rating":3},{"comment":"The Onkyo TX-NR737 is a big home cinema receiver with a huge laundry list of features. It&#8217;s THX Certified, will fire up to a 7.2 surround system, and can power two other rooms. It has 7 HDMI sockets, can upscale analogue signals, receive from a DLNA server, and has wi-fi built in, even a phono port for a turntable. In terms of features, this is a good step up from a $200 - $500 receiver, and while it has a lot of power and &#8216;goes up to 11&#8217;, the quality of the sound when playing music is not significantly different from a lower-price receiver. You&#8217;re paying for the list of features, and there have been a few corners cut to get that list to be so long.THX Certified Surround, according to the brochure, will let you &#8216;Hear Movies Precisely As the Director Intended&#8217;. Apparently, &#8217;every aspect of audio performance meets rigorous THX standards for theater-reference sound.&#8217; I have no reason to doubt this, but I didn&#8217;t have any directors available to confirm their movies were being reproduced accurately. Treat this as marketing guff, because it will frankly depend on the quality of the media you&#8217;re playing, be that DVD, Blu-Ray or whatever.7 HDMI inputs is great news for homes with ever growing collections of devices. I fitted a Comcast cable box, and Blu-Ray player, an Xbox 360, a multi-region DVD player and an Apple TV. One caveat: The seventh HDMI is on the front panel. If you are going to have seven devices permanently connected, there will be one ugly cable visible at all times. Also, while the facility for handling 4k video is available, it&#8217;s actually not on every input: &#8216;Five of the receiver&#8217;s seven HDMI inputs are based on the latest HDMI specification to support 4K video at 50\/60 frames per second and 21:9 aspect ratio for theater-reference movie display.&#8217; So be careful setting up. Why it&#8217;s only on five, I have no idea. That&#8217;s the corner cutting I already mentioned.In fact, the HDMI inputs have another case of corner-cutting: &#8216;HDCP 2.2 for future 4K and Premium Studio Content&#8217;, is available, since the movie studios do like to punish us consumers for handing over our cash so we can see the latest comic book adaption, remake or sequel. This feature, however, &#8216;supports the latest HDCP 2.2 DRM copy protection standard via HDMI Input 3 and the main output.&#8217; which means this highly touted feature is only available on one input. If you have two devices sending such content, tough luck.As it is, I can&#8217;t review these wonderful future-proofing features as I have neither 4k content, nor a 4k TV. Nice to know they&#8217;re present, but pay attention to which ports get which inputs when setting up.The TX-NR737 has Wi-Fi built in, and it&#8217;s incredibly easy to use. It attached to my wi-fi network without a hitch, and has not displayed any issues since. It&#8217;s sitting in a room with 8 other wi-fi connected devices and it just works.There are lots of networked options available, and the receiver will talk to DLNA services. Via DLNA, &#8216;Almost every hi-res and lossless format is supported, from gapless FLAC and WAV to ALAC and WMA&#8217;. This is true: I set up Plex Server on my Mac and there was no problem receiving audio of all kinds. There is some corner-cutting going on, and for some reason Onkyo decided to exclude video capabilities from their DLNA client. That&#8217;s a shame. My ~$100 Blu-Ray player does both, and being a Sony, has a nicer interface. I can&#8217;t think of a reason to use the receiver for DLNA sources if an attached device does it better.One last thing about connecting devices: analogue upscaling is great for reducing the number of cables going in and out of the receiver. Cheaper receivers generally don&#8217;t have component in\/out any more, although my 3-year old Yamaha does. But what a pain, as it only sent the signal to the component out, meaning I had to switch inputs on the TV and run another cable. The Onkyo, however, upscales the component in signal to 1080p and outputs it to HDMI. Perfect! Well, it would be, if they hadn't cut corners again.Before HDMI, component was the way to output progressive, non-interlaced pictures from a games console or a DVD player. That progressive output is sharper and more stable, with less color bleed than other analogue signals. The pricey component adapter for the Wii was well worth it, since suddenly the picture looked good, rather than fuzzy.In the Onkyo manual, it decrees that component signals to be upscaled must be interlaced, not progressive. Why? There&#8217;s no logic in that decision. I set the Wii back to interlaced and it looked as bad as it did through a cheap composite cable. Fuzzy, blurry, and bleeding colour. Whatever processing the Onkyo was doing (and I confirmed it was up converting to 1080p) made no discernible difference. It also seems you can&#8217;t run both HDMI and component out at the same time, soI plugged the Wii into the TV, set it back to progressive, and output the TV audio to the receiver. What a waste of a potentially great feature.One great benefit of moving up the price chain with this receiver was the on-screen setup. Everything you do appears on the control panel and on your TV screen. Menus are easy to navigate, it&#8217;s great to see where you are and so much easier than kneeling in front of the receiver with a remote, following arcane instructions from a manual. Great work there, Onkyo.Other nice features include binding posts for all speaker outputs, which enables the use of banana plugs: most cheaper receivers will offer posts on the front left and right outputs, then force you back to those fiddly little clips for the rest. Not here. I rewired my speakers with 12 gauge speaker wire (really thick cables) from MonoPrice, terminated them with closed banana plugs from the same place, and plugged them in. Easy. Thanks, Onkyo.The TX-NR737 provides AccuEQ Room Calibration. Room calibration is another feature low-end amps\/receivers don;t have. Place a microphone in the optimal listening position and the speakers fire a bunch of test tones to determine the acoustics of your room, then adjust the settings to be optimal. I gave it a tough test, since our room has the TV (with front and center speakers and subwoofer) in a corner, and two surrounds at the far edges of the opposite wall. In the optimal viewing position, this means all the speakers are firing directly at you from 12ft, but surround left is above the left ear, while surround right is 8ft away to the right. Not optimal, I admit, but those are the constraints. The AccuEQ system did configure the room properly, knocking down the volume of that left surround. It slightly mis-configured my floor standing front speakers, which can produce deep, directional bass (as opposed to a subwoofer, which just fires all the deep notes into the room from one point). All in all, I&#8217;d say it did a good job, but as that seating position is only one of several, I undid its setup and defined it manually.Setting up the remote control to control other appliances worked nicely, too: it automatically controls the Apple TV and found the TV quickly. I could use it to control the Comcast box, but the layout of the remote isn&#8217;t too appropriate for that, and I prefer to use the dedicated remotes for Blu Ray and DVD. With the on-screen menus, this was much less of a guessing game than on cheaper receivers.So let&#8217;s finish with sound quality: normally this would be the most important thing to cover, but with so many bells and whistles to cover, the impression is that this was not the focus of  the engineers at Onkyo when designing this receiver: the laundry list for marketing purposes was.The system may offer &#8216;thunderous 7.2-channel surround-sound&#8217;, and multi-zone audio, but I did not test them. My speaker set up is made up of the surrounds, centre and subwoofer from a Yamaha HTIAB system purchased a few years back, augmented with the wonderful Pioneer SP-FS52 floor standing speakers, which outclass almost everything up to a $500 pair for half the price.I like my audio direct, with no manipulation: mono should be duplicated through the two front speakers, stereo should not be forced into a fake surround sound, and so on. I bought floor standers so I could play stereo music without turning on the subwoofer. That&#8217;s where 7.2 presents an issue. I could have unplugged the speakers from my office and tested the 7-channel surround, but I only found one 6.1 movie and two 7.1 movies in my collection. Since all the rest were 5.1, that would mean the receiver was extrapolating sounds from those channels and spreading them amongst the extra two. That seems to me to not be &#8216;how the director intended&#8217;. In the end, I stayed with 5.1 sound for testing.My findings are simple: this receiver pumps out a lot of power. My old receiver was capable of 100w\/channel but it&#8217;s clear to me that it was not pushing air out of the speakers like the Onkyo. Movies sound great. The more blockbuster the movie, the better it sounds. If I owned anything by Michael Bay, I bet it would sound great. My only query is the bass balance: remember, this system determined my floor standers could not output enough bass and should defer to the woofer. I undid that setting, and yet the bass is still thunderous. I noticed it is actually somewhat overpowering with music, and this includes music in movies. I had to increase the volume pif the centre channel speaker, because the bass of the background music was drowning out the dialogue. To give an idea of how much bass there was, I turned down the subwoofer&#8217;s volume before realizing the bass was actually coming from the floor standers. I&#8217;m not going to knock any points off here though, since it may be my mis-matched speaker setup that&#8217;s exacerbating the bass issue with movies. On the other hand, I tried out my usual array of music tests in pure stereo, and found the bass a little overwhelming there too.It is clear to me, however, that the quality of the sound is no better than a cheap receiver: it is louder, more powerful, but it does not extract any more detail or add clarity. It is definitely a receiver for watching movies, and not particularly musical. It&#8217;s great for movies and has a lot of features, even if a few of them have been half-baked. Just be aware of the limitations of some features, as they may not be exactly what the laundry list suggests. If you need a central controller for many different devices, this is a good choice.","rating":4},{"comment":"This receiver is a wonderful step up from my several year old Harmon Kardon.  I switched to all HDMI some time ago, so love the additional ports on this receiver.  I particularly like that there is one in the front, as my wife streams the laptop through the receiver, so I no longer have the unsightly cord hanging off the back, we can store the cord when not in use.Setup was easy if you follow the directions.  I have a PS3, a Roku, and sometimes a laptop connected to my receiver.  I plan to add a PS4 next year.  The television is also connected through HDMI.  My speakers are a mixture of JBL and Polk.  This receiver drives quite a bit more power than my old receiver so the volume can now go ear-shattering levels..  I liked the self-setup for the speaker levels based on the optimal seating location.  That is another feature my old receiver lacked.Sound quality is amazing.  I tried some blurays, and some video games, all sounded outstanding.  I also streamed some audio through my PS3 and the receiver, both sounded excellent.This receiver is a pleasure to use, I highly recommend it.","rating":5},{"comment":"This receiver replaced my Pioneer VSX-1020 and now handles my TV room set up.  I am running a Paradigm surround set which really sound amazing with this receiver.  t is a huge upgrade as far as features go from my Pioneer. I have noticed some significant improvements in the sound processing.Initial set up was very quick and easy. The supplied mic worked well to phase out the speakers to the listening position. Network connection was simple and painless. It has several sound modes but I find THX mode works great with movies.The ability to have WiFi control and bluetooth streaming is really excellent. I stream Pandora without issue and have tied in to my computer for a music server.  I have had no lag or processing issues with network services.  Using the Android remote application for the phone is extremely convenient. I find I use the phone app way more than the supplied remote.Unfortunately I don't have a 4k set yet, so I can't comment on that aspect, but since the industry is heading that direction, it is a requirement for a new receiver in my eyes.  I am running an Integra DTR-60.5 for the rest of the house and yard which I love. The Onkyo shares a lot of the same features and even the same remote applications. The Integra has Audyssey which has been replaced by AccuEQ on the Onkyo. I can't tell a big difference between the two.  7 HDMI inputs is also a great feature.  Although I don't currently require all of the features, it is nice to know I have room to grow with this unit.Overall easy set up, jam packed with great features and excellent sound.  Highly recommend.","rating":5},{"comment":"The biggest selling point for this receiver is its support for 4K content. Many receivers will play 4k video, but not like this one. I upgraded to this receiver from the TX-NR609, which is an older THX Select2 Plus 7.2 receiver. I made the switch because I wanted a few of the new features, more power, and most importantly, improved 4K support. I decided to write this review for someone looking to upgrade from a low-range receiver - many readers in the market for this receiver may be bored (or even insulted) by such a high-level overview. I'll leave the low-level audiophile review to someone else with better savvy and prowess than myself.First of all - let's nail down the difference between 4K and Ultra HD (UHD). 4K is a cinematic standard equal to 40962160, which is twice the pixels of standard digital projection, 2048x1080. UHD is a consumer standard equal to 3840x2160, which is twice the pixels of Full HD, 1920x1080. As you'll see in many product descriptions, manufacturers will combine the terms, despite the fact they aren't synonymous. I'm not going to get into the weeds with the two terms, I'm going to stick with 4K, since the consumer market seems to be adopting the term over UHD.Here's a breakdown:4K support - This receiver supports HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2, which is huge. In short, HDMI 2.0 allows 4K content to be displayed @ 60Hz, as opposed to 30Hz with HDMI 1.4. With the new standard being between 60-240Hz (with plasma displays typically operating at 600Hz!), 30Hz is not acceptable. Keep in mind, to achieve 60Hz you'll need a TV that features HDMI 2.0 support as well. HDCP 2.2 is important, as providers of 4K video will likely require this standard to view content in the future. HDCP is content protection, and if HDCP 2.2 is adopted, viewers will likely not be able to view 4K content on older systems that don't support version 2.2. Another thing in small writing is you get one (yes, one) HDCP 2.2 HDMI input. For HDMI 2.0, you get four inputs on the back and one on the front.THX Select2 Plus - Nothing new here, this is the certification designed for mid-sized rooms - 2,000 cubic feet with a 10-12 ft viewing distance. The level above this is THX Ultra2, which is designed for large home theaters. Having this receiver doesn't mean you have a THX certified home theater.Wi-Fi & Bluetooth - I didn't have wi-fi on my NR609, so I had to use ethernet. I wasn't a fan of the wi-fi dongle due to the limited range - so the wi-fi and bluetooth on the NR737 was a pretty big feature that pushed me towards this receiver. I love having my receivers connected to my home network so I can use Spotify and control the receiver using my oRemote iPhone app (great app!). Its much easier making EQ\/calibration changes using the app rather than getting down on the floor to mess with the receiver's interface. Bluetooth is useful when you want to play media that is only available on your portable device. The downside is that you're limited to the 10 meter radius (give or take).AccuEQ - There is much speculation about this feature. Onkyo did away with MultiEQ by Audyssey - much to many Onkyo user's chagrin. The rumor is that MultiEQ became too expensive to license and Onkyo developed AccuEQ in-house. I haven't used AccuEQ - I calibrate myself based on the many Onkyo receivers I've had in the past. I've yet to find a professional review that speaks highly of it, but that's not to say it isn't a good piece of technology. I'll be moving soon and plan to calibrate using AccuEQ at that time. FYI - Automatic system calibration and using the \"natural\" EQ of the front channel speakers isn't a new technology or idea.Zone 2\/3 - Like previous Onkyo generations, you get a powered Zone 2. On this receiver, they've added pre-outs for a Zone 3. I like this feature, personally, because I run the Zone 3 pre-out to another receiver for whole-house audio, and I use the powered Zone 2 for an adjacent room. One huge downside to Zone 2\/3 is that it won't output a digital signal. In other words, you can't run an HDMI device on the receiver and output the audio to Zone 2\/3 speakers. It has to be an analog input such as the USB\/Net input for things like iPods that run in two channel stereo. Some of the higher end receivers offer an HDMI output to Zone 2 which defeats this shortcoming.Power - I don't think its mentioned here, and it's really hard to find from Onkyo (not published on the official product website), but this receiver produces 110 watts per channel @ 4 Ohms. Kind of weird since the TX-NR636 produces 115 watts per channel @ 4 Ohms. It's about in-line with past 7xx series receivers though.Since I had a NR609 (circa 2011), I realized a ton of improvement in features by this upgrade. I really don't see any reason to upgrade to this receiver unless you're serious about 4K content, or you're running an antiquated receiver.Bottom line - you're getting improved 4K support, which is a big deal if you're serious about 4K. If you're even considering getting a 4K TV in the future, it's probably worth the cash to spring for a receiver like this one that supports HDMI 2.0\/HDCP 2.2.","rating":4},{"comment":"Review from someone who doesn't really understand all the audio speak. If I can set this up, anyone can. I wasn't even 100% why I needed a receiver, but now that I have one - my life is much easier.Connected the surround sound and the RCA cable that drives the sound from the ROKU 3M projector.Sound quality is amazing, and despite my limited functionality (no 4K setup..yet) using this, I have yet to find anything that I don't like and a lot that I do (like the intuitive speaker sound set up!).","rating":5},{"comment":"Being able to get rid of my HDMI splitter and run each of my devices directly into the Receiver was the first big highlight of this box. This includes a Google TV, Roku 3, Xbox 360, PS4, Chromecast, Belkin Miracast and a port to plug my laptop into.  Overkill?  Yeah, but each of those things does different things better.  Unfortunately, I don't have any 4K devices or a 4K TV, so I can't comment on the 4K capabilities of this receiver, though I'm excited about the future-proofing.I live in an apartment and can't really crank the volume up much, but I did on a mid-afternoon Saturday for a minute to see how it sounded.  It sounded amazing (seriously reconsidering my decision to rent an apartment!), no distortion, clean and well balanced with very little set up.  Unless you're a super hardcore audiophile, you'll likely have your socks knocked off by the receiver (assuming it's paired with good speakers).  But volume isn't everything, and I'm happy to say the lower volumes are handled magnificently as well.  I'm sure I need to go in and tweak the setup a little bit, but the out-of-the-box settings still sound better than anything else I've used.The only issue I've had was settings not being saved during the initial setup.  I went through several menus a few times and every time I jumped between menus the settings would reflect defaults.  I can't -entirely- rule out user error but I'm pretty sure I was doing things right.  When I was trying to set up the receiver I was doing it on a small TV in my work area and it was plugged straight into the wall.  I unplugged it and moved it onto a big APC\/Surge Protector that is in my living room area and on a different circuit and had no more issues.  I have -NO IDEA- if this is at all related or a problem with the unit so I'm not knocking off stars for it.  I was going to contact customer support but the issue hasn't cropped back up since so I decided to leave it unless it happened again.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have this bad boy connected to 3 Klipsch G28s as LCRs, 2 G12s as surrounds, and SW 112.

I am attaching a video where I stream music through the speaker, then through built-in speaker of my tablet for comparison, and then back to the bluetooth speaker. You can hear how much richer, fuller, and louder the sound is when the bluetooth speaker is used. I always use the same piece of music to test different speaker. I noticed that Bach Toccata and Fugue in D minor has several deep bass sections which make some speakers crackle. So this piece of music became my stress test to see how different speakers handle deep bass. CODE Donut handled the base well. The music did not sound distorted and it handle all ranges well.The speaker is 5 inches across and a little over an inch thick. It comes with a standard micro USB charging cable (a plus!). The speaker can be used either via Bluetooth or NFC. NFC is provided by using a separate NFC tag. It worked, but because it is not part of the speaker it is easy to lose.The thing I liked least about the speaker are the buttons. They were hard to press and did not provide feedback. Some operation require a long push (for example putting the device in bluetooth mode) and I was not quite sure if I properly engaged the speaker.To summarize, I liked the sound the speaker generates, I did not like the controls and that NFC was not built-into the speaker and is easy to misplace.

I like that this uses the micro USB interface, as this is a standard, used by most Android devices, external batteries, and mobile electronics today.&#9654; Specifications* Model: CODEblu 08* Bluetooth Version: 3.0* Bluetooth Profile: A2DP, HFP* Support NFC: Yes* Speaker Output Power: 2W x 2* Power input: Micro-USB* AUX: 3.5mm audio jack* Battery type: Rechargeable Li-polymer battery* Battery size: 1000 mAh* Play Time: Up to 8 hours* Charge Time: 2 hours* Operating Range: 10m\/33ft* Dimension: 4.92 inch diameter* Weight: 0.34 lbs* Color: Black, White, Pink, Orange, Green, Yellow&#9654; HardwareIf you are reading this review then you don't need me to tell you that this shape is unique. It's very small and light at 4.9 x 4.9 x 1.1 inches; 5.4 ounces. This device can come in Black\/Orange, Orange\/Orange Cream, Pink\/White, and White\/Chocolate (on Amazon), while the user manual instructs Green\/Yellow and Yellow\/Unknown are made as well, which may be released in the future. The main color is in a hard plastic, with the minor color being a silicon rubber. The top of the speaker has the multifunctional, volume up, and volume down buttons, which are next to the LED indicator and code logo.LED Indicator:* Pairing mode: The blue LED flashes rapidly* Connected to a device: The blue LED stays on* Low battery: a \"du-du\" sound every 20 seconds.* Charging: The red LED stays on.* Fully charged: The red LED goes off.Also on the top are two large and one small hole for speakers, and an imprinted texture for sprinkles, adding to the donut experience. On the side is a silicon flap to reveal the micro USB port, and the auxiliary port. I like that this includes an auxiliary port for incompatible devices. On the bottom is a ring, to give the appearance of a glaze, which notes the name, model, and certifications. Overall, I like the build and concept of this device. It is well made and well thought out, while being very innovative.&#9654; SetupThere are two methods of pairing this device, either with Bluetooth or NFC pairing to activate Bluetooth. NFC, or near field communications, is a new method for communicating with devices by simply being very close (or literally touching). This technology allows users to experience their device without dealing with frustrating configuration or setup.* Bluetooth Pairing1. Bring the Donut to within 3 feet (1m) of your Bluetooth device.2. Turn on your Donut by 1ressing and holding the power button for 5 seconds to begin pairing. The blue LED light should be flashing rapidly.3. Follow the instruction of your Bluetooth device to bring it to pairing mode or turn on the Bluetooth menu on your device and search for the Donut speaker.4. Once the speaker has been located by your Bluetooth device you should see \"CODEblu08\", simply select the device name to connect. If your device is asking for a PIN or pass code, please enter \"0000\".5. When devices are paired, the blue light will stay on. On some devices, you might have to select \"Use as Audio Device (stereo\" or similar on the device's Bluetooth menu.* NFC PairingPlease use the CODE NFC tag to do Bluetooth pairing to your device with NFC function.1. Turn on the NFC function of your Bluetooth device first, and then turn on your Donut.2. Place the CODE NFC tag next to your NFC-enabled device (place the tag as close to the NFC chip as possible).3. Your device will automatically initiate Bluetooth connection with the Donut.4. Once connected, you can also disconnect by placing the NFC tag right next to your device.&#9654; TestingI tested this device with my Nexus 7 (2013), which is a NFC compatible device. I first attempted to pair by NFC, because I have never connected to this device before. My Nexus 7 immediately recognized the tag, and setup the Bluetooth connection, without needing to do any additional setup. The tag both turned the device on and off. I do want to note that this tag did not work when a case was over my Nexus 7. I then tested the sound quality of the speaker. The good news is that you will never have to worry about your music not being loud enough, as this small device packs a big punch. You can clearly hear the sound and bass, but it isn't too much where the device moves itself off your table. If you put your hand over the speaker holes, you can literally feel the air pushing out. My only issue with this speaker would be the three push buttons, as it takes significant force to perform any function. Even with this small issue, I am very satisfied with this product.&#9654; Final ThoughtsThis speaker has a really unique design, and gives you the ability to hear your music clearly, with a good amount of bass. I would definitely recommend a device like this to anyone who is searching for a Bluetooth speaker, and is why I give this product a 5 star rating. I can't wait to hear more innovative products like this from Taotronics.Pros:+ A very small and uniquely designed speaker, capable of producing great sound and bass.+ Choice of NFC (to activate Bluetooth), Bluetooth pairing, or auxiliary stereo cable for setup.+ Uses micro USB interface for charging, a very common interface used in most Android devices.Cons:- Buttons take significant force to perform any function.","rating":5},{"comment":"im new to using bluetooth so i figured this might be little hard to setup but i was dead wrong. first off shipping was actually early so that was a plus and product was packaged very well. its funny the box donut was in looked like a &#34;happy meal&#34; which was rather funny and after charging donut for recommended 2hrs for first charge i wa ready to pair it with my galaxy S5 which was very simple the i see in instructions there is also a NFC tad included for even easier pairing if your device has NFC. overall construction is a sturdy plastic with simple to see and use buttons for power ect. now the fun starts, after full charge a simple hold of power button for 5sec shows a flashing blue led then when paired it turns solid blue showing your paired and set to play music ect. in instructions it states while paired your device can be up to 33ft away and thats spot on and i even moved away 5ft more and still had perfect play. its a easy 5stars from me on this simple to use and great sounding external speaker. highly recommend this product and look forward to more purchases from TaoTronics","rating":5},{"comment":"This Bluetooth speaker has great sound but deliver it in odd package.Inside the box, you will discover an awkward shaped object that does not resemble a speaker. The design will make you not judge a book by its cover. Do not let the ring shaped device fool you, it is a Bluetooth speaker.In the hand, the speaker has a nice solid feel. The size is similar to a \"Large Glazed Donut\", which fits in the hand like a large snack. The speaker is made of plastic, which makes it very light but strong. Covering the speaker is coated in a matte rubber finish, which enhances the grip in the hand.There are only three buttons that all have multiple functions. The power button serves as the on\/off, paring mode, and phone answer\/end. The volume buttons also double as previous\/next track. There is a microphone located right beneath the buttons, which allows for clean crisp phone conversations.This speaker has to was to be paired, one being Bluetooth and the other NFC, which is nothing new. The Bluetooth method is done is the normal way, place you phone in scan mode while your speaker is in pair mode, ok, nothing special so far. There is a NFC tag that is placed close to your phone will prompt you to \"Pair The Bluetooth Device\" even if the Bluetooth mode is off. In order for this method to work, your must have NFC enabled. This method of NFC pairing is a game changer. Before this, you had to bring the entire device next to your phone which was not always so easy to work.Yes, this is a nontraditional Bluetooth speaker, but do not let it fool you. It has all the functions that we have all grown to love when using a mobile accessory. I have to give them bonus points for stepping out of the box and breaking the standard Bluetooth mold. Also, for the use of the NFC tag, this is forward thinking.CONTENTS:CODE Donut Bluetooth SpeakerNFC (Near Field Communication) TagMicro USB Charging CableUser ManualFEATURES:Bluetooth 3.0, A2DP, HFPBluetooth Range: 33ft (10m)NFC Support: YesSpeaker Output: 2W Per SpeakerMicrophone: YesBattery Size: 1000mAhBattery Type: Lithium PolymerCharging Time: 2 HoursMusic\/Talk Time: Up To 8 HoursDimensions: 4.92in (124mm)Weight: 5.39oz (153g)I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.","rating":4},{"comment":"There are a few very detailed reviews on specs for this device so I won't repeat any of that.

I connected it to my phone via blue tooth and it worked great.  Looks cool too!","rating":5},{"comment":"I was really not expecting much when I opened this speaker. A donut? What's the point in a speaker in this shape? Well, whatever the point, it sounds great! I was really surprised when I paired this up and started listening.It comes with an NFC tag (if you've never used one, it is really easy as long as your phone allows for NFC - near field communication -  usage. It is usually located in your settings and is an on\/off toggle. I have a number of different speakers connected to my phone so it is nice to have the NFC technology instead of having to open Bluetooth and selecting the right speaker name. All I do, once the speaker is on, is tap my phone to the soft tag (included) and it is automatically paired.The sound is great. It gets loud and you can control volume on the speaker or your device. I think this would be great if it was hung on a wall. Not only would it look cool but it sounds better when facing into a room. Another point is that you have to hold the power button down for at least 5 seconds to turn it on. My daughter kept thinking it wasn't charged since it didn't turn on quickly for her.It charges with the USB to micro USB cable (provided) and holds the charge for many hours of use. The only thing I noticed is that after a little use, the rubber covering over the controls can pop up a little from the speaker. I just pushed it back down and the adhesive reconnected without any problem.I was provided a sample for testing and review.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a nifty little Bluetooth speaker in the shape of a donut and it is covered with a soft-touch plastic finish so it&#8217;s fun to handle; children especially enjoy playing with it.It comes with a USB-to-micro charging cable. The 1,000 mAh battery charges in about two hours and will allow portable use for about eight hours at normal volume. There is an audible warning when the battery runs low.The Bluetooth pairs instantly as &#8220;CODEblu 08&#8221; or the little matching soft-touch tag can be used for NFC. The Bluetooth is very reliable and will maintain a connection for longer distances than most similar speakers I have tested. There is also a 3.5mm audio jack if a wired connection is preferred.There are two 2 watt drivers and they do a great job with the audio for a speaker this size. The microphone also works very well for phone calls.TIPS: Hold the power button down for a few seconds rather than just pressing it. This prevents it from being turned on or off accidentally. The LED will flash for pairing. For best audio, turn the volume all the way up at the source and then using the controls on the CODE Donut to adjust it.A sample was provided for testing and evaluation.","rating":5},{"comment":"This donut is actually a speaker. Hard to believe but it actually is. Not only is it a speaker, it is also a headset. I didn't know this until I connected it to my PC. When connected to PC, it created two devices, one was a bluetooth headset and the other was speakers. I couldn't get audio to come out of either. (Maybe it was just me?) Luckily this also accepts AUX input and when I used that, it worked fine.Next, I tested pairing it to my phone with NFC. I never get to use that technology on my phone and I thought it would be a great time to test it. It connected just fine as a headset. No separate devices this time.Now for the quality of audio. I am audiophile-to-be and there wasn't much bass with the speakers. There was nice trebles though and its midtones were ok too. I tested classical music, rock, and mainstream pop.My only gripe about this is that the buttons and lights are too small. The buttons are very hard to press and they are so small, you have to use your fingernails. Also, If you are charging the device and using bluetooth at the same time, the red is so overpowering that you won't see the little blue light that shows it is connected to bluetooth.","rating":4},{"comment":"Cutest and yummiest Bluetooth speaker so far. I got the pink one for my daughter who is also a donut lover.Pairing:Press and hold power button for 5 seconds. Donut will go into pairing mode if not paired already. LED should be flashing fast. If your device asks for a code, enter \"0000\".Audio quality:Audio quality is pretty decent. It has two 2-Watt speakers. Loud enough to fill-up a room. Do not ask for more bass, leave it to the buns.NFC:Don't have NFC device but to link it you just need to dangle the round donut hole sensor to your device.Quick specs:Bluetooth Ver 3.02W x 2 speakersNFC1,000 mAh battery8 hour running time per full chargeCons:The buttons are somewhat stiff to press and made of white silicone which is a dirt magnet.Otherwise, this donut Bluetooth speaker is hard to resist. If you need to get somebody a present, this item would certainly be a marvelous gift. If you are having your morning coffee, please do not dunk it!A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.","rating":5},{"comment":"I recently purchased this Bluetooth speaker on a recommendation from a friend. Admittedly, I'm not a big fan of the shape. However, when it comes to function, it works great. I've tested it with my laptop, my desktop PC, Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and my Kindle Fire HDX. In each case it paired easily. The sound quality was actually better than I expected. The sound is rich and full with plenty of base. I'm my opinion, it's a great buy.","rating":5},{"comment":"The manufacturers sent me this speaker for review, and I think it's pretty good.  As a speaker unit it performs quite well for its size and it's certainly more than just the child's toy which its novelty design might suggest.The speaker is packaged in a bright, mock-doughnut box and comes with a micro-USB cable for charging and a good user manual (in excellent English, praise be!)  It has both Bluetooth and jack connectivity but there is no jack-to-jack lead included so if you want this function (I do) you have to supply your own lead.  In use it works very well: Bluetooth pairing is very simple, the connection is stable up to about 8 or 9 metres.  It also has NFC connectivity so if you have that function (I don't) it's a handy feature.  The controls are for calls and volume only - you can't skip forward or back using the speaker - and work fine, as does the built-in microphone for calls.The sound is pretty decent for a small unit.  I have listened to a lot of music through it, from Tudor choral music to London Grammar and it all sounds OK.  As you might expect, the bass is rather weak, but the top is very sharp and the middles distinct, and it goes plenty loud enough for my comfort with no distortion or audible hiss.  It's not bad at all, although I think I would expect rather more bass and richer overall sound at this price.Obviously, the distinctive thing about this speaker in a crowded market is its design.  This will appeal strongly to some people and put others off, I suspect.  If you do like it this will do you nicely as a little portable Bluetooth speaker.","rating":4},{"comment":"Starting with a packaging, at first it's hard to believe you are dealing with a real product and not a toy. It's very colorful and definitely eye catching - place one of these on the shelf in the store, and it will definitely going to catch everyone's attention. But once you start reading it's spec, you will realize that you are dealing with a serious electronic gadget and not a toy. Once you get it out of the box, you quickly realize how much it resembles a real donut. About 5&#34; in diameter and 153g in weight, it has a soft rubber finish and clever integration of controls, ports, and speaker grills with elements resembling a real donut. The speaker comes in 6 different color combinations, where I found the orange one to have the boldest look for review! In addition to the speaker itself, other accessories include usb to micro-usb charging cable, a detailed manual and warranty card, and a very unique NFC tag accessory.Taking a closer look at the donut, you will find a cleverly integrated rubber ring at the bottom to make sure the speaker will not slip when placed on a smooth surface. On a side, you have micro-usb charging port tightly covered with a rubber flap, and AUX Input 3.5mm port to drive this speaker from any source which doesn't support wireless transmission. There is also a pinhole opening on the side for a microphone since &#34;donut&#34; can also be used as a speakerphone. On the top, you have a separate cluster with a rubbery finish covering status led, Volume up\/down buttons, and multi-function power\/call button. Buttons have a nice tactile response when pressed, and also sealed to prevent any moisture or dirt to get underneath. LED works as a charging indicator as well as a status light when paired up. And speaking of charging, donut has quite an impressive spec with internal 1000 mAh battery to drive 8hrs of sweet music playback!The sound comes from cleverly integrated grills covering a pair of 1.25&#34; speakers with a decent spec of 2W RMS each. I actually found the sound to be not bad at all! Of course, this is not audiophile quality speakers, but they delivered a loud and clear sound that filled up a relatively large room. You are not going to get as much bass, and it's on par with every other speaker of the same size I've tested. I was actually pleasantly surprised where raising the volume up to almost a max didn't produce too much crackling or distortion. As a matter of fact, I was so impressed with a sound and the looks of this speakers, I didn't want to put it down throughout entire test period.Of course, this is a wireless speaker, so I would like to talk more about the pair up. Supporting BT 3.0, I had no issues pairing it up with my Note 2 and it got connected to both phone and media audio. I was also able to maintain connection easily from 30-40ft away from the phone. But that's not all. Included with a donut is a very cleverly designed NFC tag which enables pair up with Donut just by placing it next to you NFC enabled phone. I was actually very impressed they put as much thought into a design of this tag as they did with a speaker itself. Once paired up, you can stream music wirelessly from your phone and adjust volume on the donut. You can't control the playback of songs; that has to be done from a phone itself. Also, if you receive a call, you can pick it up and use donut as a speakerphone.Overall, I have to say this is the most fun wireless speaker I have tested so far!!! It's one of those products where you will be looking for any excuse to take it outside and to show to other people. It's not exactly waterproof since speaker grills are open, but it's still rugged enough to be taken outdoors. Between it's unique design\/look, a robust wireless performance including NFC pair up option, and surprisingly good portable sound - I will definitely add CODE Donut to a list of my recommended products! Just make sure to register it with Tao Tronics to extend the warranty to 18-months!","rating":5},{"comment":"this is a  great bluetooth wireless speaker that comes w\/ the NFC (near field communication) Tag that gives it premilum sound.To be honest I really didn't expect much from this little donut but the sound really and truly &#34;ROCKED THE HOUSE&#34;.

It blends perfectly with a display set piece that we keep on the counter and outdoor bar. I was pleasantly surprised on how easy the setup went. Just turn it on and let your device discover the speaker. Simply hit pair and you are done. Once paired the unit simply needs to be turned on to re-connect and the music starts playing the last song played. I have been testing this for the last week or so and it worked perfectly every time. The sound is great and in my testing I get about 7 hours run time at 80% volume. It is a neat gadget that gets lots of comments from family and friends. The best part is the ease of use and reliability in re-connecting when powered on. My wife loves it because she can use her Nexus 5 when preparing dinner to play her favorite tunes. I love it because it sounds great and in 7 days never missed a beat! Love it!

The monitor itself is extremely nice; text and webpages look crisp on the 1080p screen.It's fast; the Chrome OS doesn't require a heavy-lifting processor or ram.  Do not let the specifications fool you; this thing flies.Immediately upon hooking it up I swapped out the wired mouse and keyboard for wireless counterparts.  I really don't like wires.  Any USB\/bluetooth wireless mouse and keyboard combo will work with the set.I would definitely recommend this computer to anyone.","rating":5},{"comment":"I love this thing a lot. I own several chrombook laptops & now have set this up as a desktop. Because it has an HDMI-in I have been able to hook up my new windows desktop with it too & now I just push the chrome button on the front of the monitor stitch back & forth between Chrome OS & Windows.  It  is really great to have the best of both worlds with what is essentially an all in one monitor. A lot of the reviews have said bad things about both the wired keyboard & mouse & long-term I will probably go wireless but to be  honest I have had zero problems using either one. They both work well & I'm a good typist & I caaan keep my speed up with no problem when typing.  The IPS screen is a huge improvement on the 1366x768 screens on most current Chromebooks. I don't yet know if either the ram &\/or the SSD is user upgradable but even if it isn't, I think this unit is a keeper. Having a powerful Windows machine just one button-push away is ideal. For anyone considering buying a monitor for their current mac or windows desktop buying this thing instead will meet that need very well plus providing the super fast Chrome OS machine to the mix as a free bonus. Chrome is so fast & safe that I tend to use it to do all my e-mailing, texting, & web surfing & I can aways swithch over to my PC to do Photoshop work or high end gaming.  It provides me the besst of both worlds. Two big thumbs us.","rating":4},{"comment":"I have been a Chrome OS\/Chromebook user for over a year now, and in that time I went from one Samsung Series 3 Chromebook to owning 5 Chromebooks and a Chromebox.  I have the Samsung, the HP-11, an Acer C720 4GB (with upgraded 128GB SSD), a C720 2GB, and the Toshiba 13.  I also have the Asus Chromebox Haswell with upgraded memory and SSD.  All of my Chrome OS devices have served flawlessly and they all get plenty of use in our house.  I purchased this LG Chromebase for my wife to use, but I have spent a fair amount of time with it as well.  I also purchased a Chromebase for my in-laws to replace a 9 year-old Toshiba laptop they had been using.  The LG Chromebase is an excellent example of a Chrome OS device, though there is room for improvement.  It really represents a great value (in my opinion), and it&#8217;s the perfect computer for someone who&#8217;s just wants to surf and email, and is always calling you for technical support.  However, If you want more flexibility, something in black (which I thought LG was going to offer in the US), or the ability to upgrade RAM and SSD&#8217;s, the Asus Chromebox, along with the monitor of your choice, is probably a better pick.  The Chromebase cost me $329 while the Chromebox, monitor, cable, keyboard, mouse, and speakers came to just over $400.  The memory and SSD upgrade I did to the Chromebox added another $150, but prior to that upgrade the Chromebox and Chromebase had the same basic specs.SCREEN:  Like a Chromebook, this Chromebase is tied to it&#8217;s screen so of course, the quality of that screen is very important.  While the IPS screen is more than adequate with good color and brightness, it isn&#8217;t a class leader by any means.  I have an Asus 23&#8221; IPS screen set up with my Chromebox and it beats the Chromebase screen in really every regard.  It&#8217;s brighter,  has better colors, and has much better contrast.  And, I can easily upgrade it if I choose to do so.  Still, as part of this easy all in one package, the LG Chromebase screen gets the job done just fine.  It took about 5 minutes to assemble the base to it using the 6 phillips head screws.  What people also need to realize is that the monitor has it&#8217;s own settings that are controlled by the touch buttons on the front.  It&#8217;s not like the screens in the Chromebooks that have no adjustments (aside from resolution).  I suggest taking the time to play with the settings if you buy one of these.  The &#8220;Reader&#8221; button on the monitor is nice allowing you to quickly drop the brightness to preset levels, and the &#8220;Chrome&#8221; button makes it easy to switch sources from the Chrome system to the external HDMI input.  The built in speakers work well too; just remember to turn up the volume on the front of the monitor itself or you won&#8217;t get enough volume (as some reviewers have complained about).  To do this you just touch on the left and right arrows of the monitor (when the menu is not up)COMPUTER:  The performance of the computer is as good as any of the Haswell Chromebooks and Chromeboxes I&#8217;ve used.  It&#8217;s disappointing that you can&#8217;t easily upgrade the SSD or the memory, but with the lean Chrome OS and the low cost of online storage neither of these is an issue (and everyone should learn how to work in the cloud).  I have not had any problems with the WiFi, and the Bluetooth works good too.  It&#8217;s nice that it has a built in port for wired operation as well.  I was disappointed that the Chromebase didn&#8217;t include a built-in card reader, but with 4 USB ports you can always add an external drive or a card reader.  If you have a newer digital camera, you can connect it directly to the Chromebase and it will automatically upload your photos to your Google Drive for you.  It will do the same if you have a phone as well.  It searches for the DCIM folder on your device, and if that folder has media files like pictures and videos it will save them automatically.  Another nice feature is the HDMI port that allows you to connect a second HDMI source to the monitor.  I haven&#8217;t used it, but I have read other reviews that were quite happy with this capability.  When I logged into my Google account with the Chromebase it automatically set itself up to work with my cloud printer, and the Chromebase also works well with my external DAC\/headphone amp, just like all the other Chrome OS devices I own.KEYBOARD AND MOUSE:  The included keyboard and mouse are adequate, but they are cheap.  One of my favorite island style keyboards is the one on my HP Chromebook 11.  The keys are good sized, have a good feel, decent travel with a nice snap to them while still being incredibly quiet, The Chromebase keyboard is a good size for my hands, but its only other positive quality is that it has the built in Chrome OS buttons.  I chose to purchase a Samsung Chrome keyboard to use with my Asus Chromebox, and it isn&#8217;t all that great either. It would be nice if someone came out with a nice Chrome keyboard now that there are several devices on the market that would benefit from one.  You can use a wired or wireless standard keyboard if you want, you just have to relabel (or reassociate in your brain) the F-buttons for the chrome functions.  The mouse tracks just fine, but it is really cheap and light and it is lacking a few functions.  You get far more features and capabilities with a Chromebook touchpad than with the Chromebase mouse.  At least the Logitech mouse I bought for my Chromebox has a wheel that can tilt left and right to page back or forward. But it would be nice to have a button on the mouse that could launch the Chrome app switcher (the button on the keyboard that has a rectangle followed by 2 lines).  I know another user had mentioned swapping the LG mouse and keyboard for Apple products, but he didn&#8217;t speak to any added functionality.SUMMARY:  I am rating this product 5 Stars for its quality (so-so mouse and keyboard aside) value, and simplicity.  My wife really enjoys her Chromebase, but I think my in-laws like theirs even more.  Their old computer had been so bad for so long, they had no idea how much computing had changed over the past 5 or 6 years.  They especially like the speed and screen quality\/size (and they LOVE Hangouts calls and Spotify).  I like the fact that aside from answering the occasional Chrome OS operational question I don&#8217;t have to provide constant IT support for system problems (virus\/malware\/spyware software, java updates, plug-ins, updates that install 50 other programs, clicking on links that hijack your browser, and the list goes on).  If you want a Chrome OS device for home use only, aren&#8217;t interested in upgrading the internals (which are very capable for most users), are okay with the white color, and you don&#8217;t want to have to deal with finding the right screen, mouse, and keyboard this is the machine for you.","rating":5},{"comment":"Pros:Terrific IPS screenBoots from full off to logon screen in secondsSnappy performance for its specsDrop dead simple to useLots of useful appsCons:Low end keyboard and mouseTinny speakersLimited storageCan't run Windows x86 programsPrinting documents is a challengeFeedback between monitor and USB mouseOther thoughts:We're a Windows PC household, with three desktops I built and a couple of portables, so I'm comfortable around computers.  I've also had Apple computers in the past, starting with the Apple IIe in the 80s and ending with a Mac Mini a few years ago.  I have to say the Chromebase is the easiest computer I've ever set up.It is also a very nice looking unit, something of an iMac lookalike due to the stand, although definitely not the same build quality.  The Chromebase is all plastic construction, to be expected at this price point, but nicely executed.  The keyboard and mouse are budget items but I found typing on the keyboard to be pleasant enough, with good tactile response and key travel; not bad at all for a membrane keyboard.  The mouse is a cheap, lightweight thing, but it gets the job done.  The money you're paying is for the monitor.  It's a very nice, full HD IPS screen that looks terrific.  This is not your father's netbook screen.There is some assembly required but it's well documented and simple, just six screws to mount the computer to the stand.  Then all I had to do was connect the mouse, keyboard, Ethernet cable, and power.  As soon as I plugged in the power the computer booted to the logon screen in just seconds.  There was a brief, optional tutorial on the screen after logging on and then I was up and running.We network in our house using powerline adapters, and I hooked the Chromebase up to an adapter during setup for internet connectivity, then later went online with wireless to see how well that worked.  No problems with either mode, they both worked as they should.  After logging on to wireless the first time the system will automatically default to that if the wired Ethernet is disconnected.I tried all the programs that would be important to me if I didn't care about AAA gaming or fancy image editing programs.  I tested Gmail, Netflix, web searches with Google using Chrome, Outlook.com, Pandora, and a bunch of others, and everything worked just as it was supposed to with no hassle.  Netflix movies, for example, stream nicely with no stuttering.  I especially liked that I can open the Outlook Web App (OWA) to access my work email.  High-end gaming is not an option on this device but performance is surprisingly good considering the specs.  I tried a couple of the free games in the app store, like Bejeweled, and they ran fine.  I didn't experience any noticeable lags or slowdowns, but be aware that with only 2GB of RAM you won't be able to do any serious multitasking.I also tried multimedia files to see how they would play.  I ripped one of my movies to .mv4 format on my Windows desktop and transferred it to a 3.0 USB stick, then launched the movie on the Chromebase.  It played flawlessly with adequate volume, as did .mp3 music files.Speaking of volume, you can set it using both the screen menu arrows and the keyboard's dedicated volume keys.  I noticed that if I had the volume set to 100% using the screen menu there was an intermittent, high-pitched, quiet but noticeable squeal that sounded like a hardware feedback loop.  Interestingly, the noise would occur when I moved the mouse.  I found that if I lowered the onscreen volume to about 65% the noise went away (or was so low I couldn't hear it), even when I maxed out the volume using the keyboard.  I experimented with another USB mouse and got the same results. Then I tried two different wireless mice, one Bluetooth and the other RF.  Neither produced the squeal and they worked just fine with all volumes set to max.  The moral of the story: if you get one of these plan on investing in a wireless mouse.  Oh, and don't expect much from the speakers, they sound like what you would typically get on a laptop, with no bass to speak of.  Sound is greatly improved when using headphones or external powered speakers, of course.I was curious to see how Google Docs would handle Office documents so I experimented with Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.  All three opened up fine from the USB stick but I was not able to edit the PowerPoint file, only view it.  Nor could I launch the presentation.  One Excel file was a relatively simple one with no fancy charts, but it did have several formulas like autosum which worked as they should.  However, a second spreadsheet with objects inserted (checkboxes) wouldn't display the objects.  A free app in the store offers a simple workaround if you need more editing power, Word Online, which is bundled with Excel Online and PowerPoint Online, but even Excel Online can't display embedded objects.  If you have to create more sophisticated documents you're going to have to use a Windows or Apple PC.  While the Google Docs are saved to Google Cloud the Office documents are saved to OneDrive so you'll need an account for that if you want to use the Online Office apps.  There is also native support for .pdf files built into the operating system, and all the .pdf files I tested maintained their proper formatting.My other complaint with documents on the Chromebase is how printing is handled.  You have to either buy a printer that is \"Cloud Ready\" or connect to a Windows PC that has a \"Classic\" printer attached to it.  This solution will be workable if you're using the Chromebase in a household that already has Windows PCs like mine but it won't work for households that just want one simple computer to handle basic computing needs.  For those households it's either buy a \"Cloud Ready\" printer or don't print at all.I was curious to see if the USB 3.0 port on the side of the monitor (there also are three USB 2.0 ports in the back) could power something bigger than a thumb drive so I hooked up a USB 3.0, 500GB Seagate external drive.  It took only a moment to launch, and all of the files stored on it were accessible.  In addition to the ones I mentioned earlier I was also able to view .bmp and .jpg image files.  By the way, I found a \"File\" app preinstalled that takes me right to the file tree; very easy to navigate if you need to go there.I've been using the Chromebase exclusively since I got it while my Windows desktop sits idle, and I have to say that all-in-all this is a very nice unit.  I'm giving it 4 stars even though it isn't perfect, simply because you're getting so much value for the money.  I would have given it a perfect score if it hadn't been for the feedback problem between the monitor and the mouse and the difficulty with printing and handling of some documents.  Frankly, I think this computer excels at its intended use and price point.","rating":4},{"comment":"I bought two Chromebase devices for my sons to replace ageing hand-me-down laptops. We were familiar with Chrome OS as my wife had been using a Chromebook as her primary computer for the past two years, and were very happy with the concept. Our family is a heavy user of Google and Amazon web services, and my sons do not need any local software applications, so going Chrome was an easy choice.Chromebases were easy to set up, and were up and running in five minutes flat. The device turns on freaky fast, and network and Google account setup was extremely well thought of. I was a bit surprised to find the monitor frame to be silver (if not chrome?!) and not white as the rest of the device, but I'm now used to it. The monitor is good - relatively bright and with wide viewingn angle. Performance is snappy and I don't see myself upgrading to 4GB of memory. There are a few USB ports in the back and on the side as well. The keyboard is mushy as remarked by other reviewers. They are OK for my kids that \"hunt and peck\" but if I was using the computer myself, I would invest $10 in a nicer keyboard - but with the standard USB ports that is easily done. I'm actually OK with the mouse although I've seen nicer - again nothing $10 could not solve if you get fed up with it.The only thing that caused small annoyance for me was the Wifi range. The computers are set up in a room that does not have the greatest wifi coverage. Just for reference, signal strength was not a problem with the old laptops, but my sons' iPad Minis have zero bars. The Chromeboxes were not able to reliably connect to the network and I had to remedy the situation by getting a Netgear repeater. I am now getting 15-20Mbps with the Chromebases through the repeater no problem and streaming HD video (which looks great on the 22\" screen by the way!).Overall I would definitely recommend the product to anyone who uses web-only apps. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. I only wished LG had spent a few more dollars on the keyboard and wifi antenna, and perhaps kept the monitor frame white to stick with the otherwise beautiful design concept.","rating":4},{"comment":"I bought 5 of these...

The whining sound on the new unit is still there but not nearly as loud so far. Unfortunately, the screen on the new unit has some serious backlight bleed\/cloudiness. I've posted an image to the customer image gallery displaying a solid black image on the screen to demonstrate just how bad it is. I'm not really sure if I should just live with it or risk another exchange.I just purchased this to augment my usage of my aging 7 year old 24\" iMac. I've found it to be much snappier in browsing and the screen much brighter, whiter, and sharper. I like that the screen is only just slightly smaller but the device has a much much smaller footprint than my iMac since it doesn't have the huge bezels.Performance:The performance has been pretty surprising to me so far. Webpages load very quickly and flash content seems to work really well. The start up time from power off is quite impressive at 5-10 seconds. When I first hooked it up and plugged the power in by the time I plugged it into the surge protector and glanced back up at the screen it was already booted to the initial setup screen. So far I don't feel like I will need any additional ram. I've used Chrome with several tabs open including flash content without any noticeable lag. I should note that the I switched to the Beta channel of ChromeOS which I found much faster and better than the initial OS\/Firmware installed. Scrolling through webpages is incredibly smooth. Obviously, it isn't a powerhouse but for the price it's quite good.Storage:It only has a 16GB solid state drive. This isn't really an issue for me as I have a 2TB external drive and much prefer the really quick bootup times of the SSD. It also includes 100GB of Google Drive online storage for two years after activation of the offer. Be sure you are using the Gmail account you want the extra Google Drive storage applied to as you can only do it once and only if the computer is brand new and hasn't had the offer redeemed on it before. If you purchase the device used or refurbished you probably won't get the extra online storage.Peripherals:I actually rather like the keyboard which I didn't expect considering the various reviews saying how cheap it seems. The keys are raised more than most modern chiclet style keyboards and have a soft, tactile, and pleasant click. I feel like I type a lot quicker on it and hunt for keys less as a touch typist. The mouse is what I really hate. It is very light and cheap feeling and in addition to that it causes a high pitched whining sound\/feedback to come from the computer. I'm not sure if this is some kind of interference through the speakers or something else. Basically, it will emit a slight whine when not being moved but when you move it it gets much more shrill and annoying. I quickly replaced it with an Apple Magic Trackpad which seems to work very well.Display:The screen is very uniform, sharp, and and backlight white(not too blue like some led backlit displays). The picture quality seems great after I adjusted the brightness, gamma, and contrast. I felt that it was slightly washed out and the fonts slightly illegible before doing so. One of my only complaints is that it has a visible dead pixel on the right side of the screen. I'm not happy about it but feel like I can probably live with it since it isn't right in the center(and hoping it doesn't get more than one). I feel like it's a vast improvement over my iMac's screen which has gotten a bit dimmer over time and doesn't have the most uniform backlight.Sound\/Speakers:The built in speakers are not very loud and sound tinny and slightly muffled. Please note that one of the frequent complaints is that the built in speakers are barely audible. Unfortunately, a lot of people\/reviewers miss that there are separate volume controls on the Chromebase and also Chrome OS or the keyboard. The left and right capacitive arrows next to the menu button on the Chromebase double as hardware volume controls. Turning these up increases the hardware volume controls separate from Chrome OS. Unfortunately, I've found turning them to 100% is the likely cause of the whining noise I mentioned above when using the mouse. I've found this is mostly eliminated by leaving the hardware volume less than 90%. The built in speakers are good enough for casual use but you probably won't be able to hear them in a loud environment or if you use a room or desk fan. I recommend being prepared to use external speakers or headphones.Printing:You can either use Google Cloud Print if you have a PC\/Mac or print directly to a Google Cloud Print ready network enabled printer. Google has a list of compatible devices on their website.Chrome OS:Chrome is a very basic OS where you basically live in the web browser. This really isn't a device that you could feasibly use without a constant or at least frequent internet connection. You can use some apps offline but the reality is you really need to be connected to the internet to do much of anything. The benefit of this is that since there isn't really anything else running in the background you get absolutely snappy performance even on the most basic hardware. You can find almost anything you need to do online or in the cloud now such as MS Office Online so I wouldn't really have any trouble using this as my main device if I needed to. I actually prefer Chrome OS over essentially any Windows device for it's quick and basic navigation. Please note a frequent questions a get is whether or not Skype works on Chrome OS. Unfortunately, you are stuck with using Google Hangouts for video conferencing as Skype isn't available for Chrome yet.I personally use the beta or developer channels of Chrome. I've found the performance better and there are some UI changes that I prefer on the later versions. You can switch to either Stable, Beta, or Developer channels on Chrome OS. Stable will be the most reliable but is only updated perhaps once a month or less. Beta updated around once a week, is usually stable enough for everyday use, and will likely have more features and updates than the stable channel. Developer has the absolute latest features and updates that Google is testing and is updated around twice a week but would be the most risky and possibly buggy and unstable. I personally recommend the Beta channel and don't recommend the developer version unless you are a power user and simply want the latest. Depending on which version of Chrome is installed on your Chrome OS device you can change it by click the Chrome Menu(the icon at the top right that looks like 3 dashes)> Settings> Help> More Info> Change Channel. If you are on a later beta\/developer version it's Settings> About> More Info> Change Channel.Conclusion:Everyone that has seen it setup in my house is impressed that it only cost $329 and felt that it looks much more expensive(minus the included mouse of course) and thought it seemed really fast. I've personally been impressed with the incredible bootup time and very snappy browsing, nice screen, and slim profile\/design. It runs almost completely quiet and cool and I haven't heard any fans come on so far. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for an easy to use replacement for an older desktop as long as you aren't looking to do any advanced work like Photoshop or something of that nature. This would be a particularly good choice for kids or less than tech savvy parents or grandparents as it stays up to date automatically and doesn't usually experience any issues with viruses or hard to diagnose technical problems. I highly recommend purchasing a mouse or trackpad to replace the one included. Overall, it's a great device and I don't think you can go wrong by purchasing it at this price.","rating":4},{"comment":"The Chromebase is the best in it's class.  Granted it is the only Chrome OS all-in-one.  Overall it's a nice computer, but a few details show that LG is new to the computer game.  Maybe when HP or Samsung come out with an all-in-one it will be better, but for now the Chromebase is great.Pros:Screen  is bright, clear and large.Performance is great.Complete package with mouse, keyboard and stand.Cons:Speakers are not good, but it does have an audio out.Capasitive buttons aren't intuitive.No SD card slot.For those interested, it looks like the RAM is theoretically up gradable.

That simplicity has even improved and also gives a beautiful large clear picture that is bright enough for these old eyes.

If anyone has any ideas of how to remedy this please let me know.UDPATE 6\/14\/2014: I have discovered that the buttons at the bottom of the monitor control the sound level. The sound does get much louder than originally thought, however it is a bit tinny and distorted at louder levels. The machine runs well, and seems to be quick and responsive, I bet it would run even quicker if it had 4 gb of ram instead of 2 though.  I am using it as a whole house computer right now in my kitchen. If you are buying a Chrome machine just know its limitations, you can't install programs on it, but the apps that are available make for good replacements.","rating":4},{"comment":"I have used a dual monitor setup at my home workstation for several years.  Using this LG monitor in split screen mode easily replaces the need for two traditional smaller monitors.  In a word, it's exceptional.  Screen resolution is excellent for HD video as well as online gaming.  In addition, it has essentially done away with my need for a separate television as it features multiple HDMI ports so I can also hook up my DVD\/Blu-Ray player.For a screen this size, the monitor is surprising light weight and easy to assemble.  Out of the box it took me about five minutes to attach the stand, plug it in to my PC, and start using the device.  The only assembly required is using a couple screws (provided) to connect the stand to the body of the monitor and snapping a plastic cover over the screw holes.One important issue to note is that this monitor does not include a VGA input port.  This will likely not be an issue for most people as newer computers using include an HDMI port, and a VGA port would likely be inadequate for such a large HD monitor.  Also, given the shape of the screen, expect two large black bars on the side when watching either wide screen or full screen programs.  This device is designed to be a computer monitor and not a standalone TV, so the shape is not such that it is filled by widescreen video.This is an excellent quality, easy-to-use product that is well worth the price as it can potentially take the place of two existing devices.  I had not used an LG monitor or television for several years based on some past issues.  However, this device has made me reassess that decision.  It is easily recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"Has totally changed how I work. I can put 3 vertical windows (Browser, Files\/Terminal, Code Editor ... in my case) side-by-side, and not bother with switching around. I can fit the browser, code editor, and even a video at near 1:1 HD. Having one cable (thunderbolt) connected to my laptop means I can leave\/plug-in in a second. Good color and contrast, smooth response time (business usage, movies, and some games). Would be great if it could tilt down a bit more, but I just adjusted my chair and foot rest instead. The blinking light when it's off is bright, so probably not something you want near your bed.Wish I could fit another on my desk.","rating":5},{"comment":"As I write this review I know that this item is not available yet for purchase on Amazon, and probably will get unhelpful votes, as I did receive this from Amazon vine and probably wouldn't have purchase this on my own without that. But with that being said here is my review:I am not really tech savvy, but we do have a need for monitors in my house. First off it was very easy to put together. Screws are provided to screw the base to the screen. There are two height selections to choose from, they are about an inch apart. The base is silver with a clear body that attaches to the screen. Very seamless, and lightweight.I decided to use this monitor in a less conventional way, and hook it up to the xbox 360 to play games, watch youtube videos, and amazon prime. The hook up is real easy. Haven't tried it yet, but would like to see with the split screen capabilities whether or not you can connect two xbox consoles and play them simultaneously.The screen is very wide, being 34inches, so it really changes the way you play xbox games.  Feels like you are actually seeing more of the game. But if it is too much for you, you can scale down the size of the screen. For the xbox menus it does stretch, but for the actual gaming it does not.  And the monitor being so crisp it great to watch movies from Amazon prime and youtube. I have never seen a display so crisp and clear like this monitor.","rating":5},{"comment":"Hands down the best monitor I ever used.I do a lot of motion graphics related work and this monitor is amazing.","rating":5},{"comment":"This monitor is so big that I find it more uncomfortable work with than my slightly smaller monitor. The colors are great, and I had intended to use this split screen for work, but at split screen I don't like the final screen size either.I think this is a lot of money for this monitor as well. I have two other monitors that cost less than half of what this cost, and they work just as well with a more manageable screen size.I do tons of photo editing, video production, and web site development and actually prefer two separate monitors to using this as a split screen.Gamers on the other hand will fall in love with this monitor and find it very useful to get so much on their screen.Before you buy, I recommend you try to see if this will be a good choice for you.","rating":4},{"comment":"I am very impressed with this monitor.

It was supposed to be widely available in May, (I bought and paid for mine 3 months ago) but now LG says late August, early September, and that is a maybe. I have heard from many reliable sources that this monitor did not get built correctly and they are trying to correct the issues, but not having success. LG is being unreasonably tight lipped about this and that makes these rumors and suspicions ring true. Look elsewhere.EDIT:So I finally got my monitor, 5 months after I had ordered and paid for it.It is \"okay\".I expected better, I am not going to lie. But I am bumping my rating up to a 3, because it arrived.Pretty awkward menu system. No calibration out of the box. Annoying menu's that won't go away.But, its a monitor. And it's wide. And it will serve its purpose for the time being.","rating":3},{"comment":"I will get down to the nitty gritty in just a second, but I have to open this review by saying that this monitor is so stunning, so incredibly crisp, clear and vivid that I feel like I need better eyes just to take it all in. When I switch from this monitor to my Apple monitor I feel like I am switching from real life to a coloring book.With that out of the way, the UM95 LG monitor is a 60hz 3440x1440 monitor with a semi-matte display, two HDMI ports, Display port, 3 USB and 2 thunderbolt inputs so right away you can tell that this is a serious piece of electronics. Once you get it up and running, you find that that's only the tip of the iceberg.Besides the stunning display (I mean stunning - blacks are true black, colors pop off the screen and even teeeeenny tiny font and images look crisp and perfect) the wide format means that you really have some ample real estate for all of your programs. And even better, the monitor can handle two separate inputs, which means that you can run one computer through one input and a Blu-Ray player movie through another (for instance). It took a little bit of fiddling around, but I got the two input feature to work with minimal fuss.The monitor also includes software that allows you to split your screens automatically. That means that if you have a browser, Photoshop, a mail client and a second browser running, with just a click of a button the software will automatically divide your programs up into four equal parts of the screen (or thirds or halves or a range of combinations, including manual) so that you can see everything you need to see. I'm already finding the extra space so useful that I struggle when I have to go back to using a plain old single-width monitor.I was worried that the double width would make the screen difficult to view at the edges, but I think it is just the right width that you can take everything without moving your head and without having the screen split into two so that you can angle it better. As far as speed goes, the monitor is quick through Thunderbolt, no lag that I can see at all.The monitor claims to cover 99% of the SRGB spectrum and I have to say, I don't doubt it. When photo editing, I can see colors that I never knew were in the image and everything looks so full and lifelike that I doubt I can ever edit on a standard monitor again. I will just feel like I am missing details.The LED backlighting makes the screen look even and very vivid. When I plugged my Macbook Pro into the monitor, the desktop that I have been using for years suddenly looked more detailed and lifelike than it has ever looked before. Amazing. The pre-calibrated settings work great but a little toggle button on the bottom of the monitor gives you quick access to change whatever you need and get things just how you like them. My Macbook Pro had no trouble running this monitor - I tried both HDMI and Thunderbolt connects - and the resolution works with no problem (my laptop is 2011 model). My husband's PC couldn't handle the resolution so it just ended up having black bars on the two sides, so kind of a waste if your laptop can't manage to resolution, so check to make sure that it can.I have one minor complaint, but it isn't a big deal. When you use the built-in speakers to listen to music - which are incredibly good for built-ins, by the way - you can't use the volume keys on the Mac keyboard, nor can you use the dimming keys to make the monitor brighter in dark rooms. * EDIT - this is only the case when using HDMI input. If I use the Thunderbolt input, the volume (but not dimming) works from the keyboard input. You also must have the Thunderbolt cable if you want to use the USB ports for a laptop mouse and keyboard. Without the Thunderbolt, the USB ports don't work (took me a while to figure this out).Did I mention the display is amazing?","rating":5},{"comment":"This is, by far, the nicest monitor I've ever owned. It also happens to be incredibly user-friendly, too, which I appreciate. The ultra-wide screen (21:9 aspect ratio) can easily be split into four different viewing sections at the touch of a button. I love being able to view multiple documents, applications, etc., at the same time. The dual link-up feature is very convenient as well, allowing me to hook up my computer and iPhone to the monitor at the same time.Plus, the resolution on this monitor is nothing short of amazing. Like other reviewers have said, editing photos on this screen is such a different experience from editing photos on my laptop; the colors are more vibrant, and I can see so much more detail. I feel like I'm slumming it when I go back to just using my macbook (and I love my macbook).I can really see the impressiveness of the display quality, though, when my husband uses it for playing video games. I thought we had a nice TV before, but there is no contest with the color quality and level of detail in the LG screen. Hubs was absolutely blown away by the video quality, and I have a feeling this monitor is going to &#34;mysteriously&#34; find its way to a permanent spot in his game room very soon.Overall, the LG monitor is stunning and very user-friendly. Highly recommended!","rating":5},{"comment":"Not all monitors are created equal.There is a huge assortment of monitors on the market from which to choose, and each one brings strengths and weaknesses to the table. Which monitor is a best-fit often is driven by cost, brightness, resolution, speed, power consumption&#8230; This particular flat-screen LED monitor by LG excels in most of these areas and a whole lot more. The catch is the price - $999 as I write this &#8211; but it&#8217;s worth every penny of this.The monitor arrived in a huge box (which should be fairly obvious) and when we opened the packaging we could not help but notice that it was very well packaged to minimize possible damage to the contents. Everything was packed in tightly so that nothing was able to shift in the box, which shows that LG put some thought in the packaging. This was a plus before we even plugged it in.I have a teenage son who is an online gamer so I selected his laptop computer as the testing ground for this monitor. This particular system is a Core i7-based system (reporting 8 cores, not just 4) with two video cards and running Windows 7, making it an ideal testbed for this monitor. We plugged everything in, connected the monitor to the computer through the HDMI interface and rebooted. The resolution is absolutely stunning &#8211; it came up at 3440x1440 without any manual intervention and we did not need to load up any special drivers. After using it at that resolution for a while we decided to scale it back to a lower resolution, to make images and text bigger.The image quality is fantastic. There are no dead pixels at all and everything is very bright, clear and visible. The main complaint my son has had with other monitors is the lack of brightness and the inability to see certain things due to the inability to brighten the image. With this monitor, all complaints have stopped.When gaming, my son has exclaimed about how much extra space he has in the virtual realm in which he plays and has seen a slight increase in the game speed. That is, his complaints regarding video lag have all but gone away.Set at the highest resolution there is a real advantage for software developers, particularly when wanting to see more &#8220;stuff&#8221; on one screen. When opening an IDE for development, opening multiple files in a side-by-side arrangement on a screen this size becomes very comfortable. It&#8217;s easy to see most files at line width and still have room for two or three more files in a row across. This is so much nicer than having two monitors that may or may not allow for moving open windows between them (depending on the system configuration).One very nice feature of this monitor is the built-in USB ports that allow one to connect devices behind the monitor, clearing up desk clutter in the process. That can be used as a USB hub of sorts, which frees up ports on the connected system. One surprise we got, though, was that as a connected USB device itself it steals the sound away from the main speakers and pipes them through its own (which are of good, but not great, quality). It was a little disconcerting when we tried to connect headphones to the system and the sound was still audible without the phones on. Once we figured this out it became a non-issue.So, I have one and only one issue with this monitor &#8211; it is actually too big to fit on my own desk. As a result, my son uses it all the time now as his desk can handle it.LG has designed and built a truly amazing monitor. It&#8217;s bright, has amazing resolution and is wide enough to replace two monitors and then some. It is expensive but it is unlikely that you&#8217;ll find a better monitor for less unless you really need something smaller.","rating":5},{"comment":"I purchased this monitor at Frys electronics as soon as it became available, and have loved it since.the 3440X1440 resolution is amazing for my multitasking needs, video editing, photoshop, and viewing edge to edge movies as intended. it all just works.Along with the split display feature i can connect my PC\/or MAC to either display port, or thunderbolt port, and still have either my ps4 or xbox one connected via hdmi and work and play with just one monitor.  (you can also connect any hdmi device, video camera, cable box, etc... for the split screen function)There are some additional usb 2.0 and 1 usb 3.0 ports but my unit did not come with the cable necessary to connect the pass through to my computer.As a previous owner of the LG 29UM95 which is the 29 inch 21:9 aspect 2560X1080 this new 34UM95 is a good step up for my needs, one thing to note is that unlike the previous 29 inch model the 34 inch unti does not have  a DVI port, this may not be an issue, and it does come with a  display port to display port cable, and an HDMI to HDMI cable (both FULL) just in case you ahve an older graphics card without those ports, you may have to purchase an additional adapter cable.Definitely recommendedI hope this helps! - MJ","rating":5},{"comment":"Got this from a different online shopOk first of all , no one should be fooled about this product , it is no  match to the igzio 4k panel, I own 3 x 4k asus igzio as 12 k setup and its not even fair to compare it to the igzio panel .The 34 LG is a wonderfull monitor by its own standards , lovely wide , classic lg ips quality , simply its much better then any 2k 30 inchs from DELL OR HP and ofc the TN 4k panels.Yes I recommend it but again know that u r not buying a 4k igzio","rating":5},{"comment":"After my 28&#34; TN Panel monitor died last year, I have been searching for a replacement. Anything above a 24&#34; monitor that is designed specifically for computers is fairly rare, and fairly expensive. There are a few 27 and 28&#34; monitors, but pretty much anything else is going to be a TV monitor with a tuner that is designed for a home entertainment system. Although the price tag on the LG UM95 is very high, it is fairly reasonable when considering the screen size and panel type. Anyone who is considering a monitor of this price tag I expect will already know the difference between a TN and an IPS panel, the types of input connections they need, and what they will be using this for. You can certainly find much cheaper 32&#34; monitors than this, but you won't find a more beautiful IPS panel that you'll enjoy looking at even when it's off. At 17 pounds, this monitor is extremely light. Since I have mine mounted on anErgotron Wall Mount, it moves very easily and was simple to mount. My 4 year old GPU couldn't run the monitor at its highest settings, so I upgraded to aSapphire Radeon R9 290. I connected it via DisplayPort and had no issues at all with it. I first started up Arma III and jacked the settings up to ultra, including changing the aspect scale to 21:9 and the resolution to 3440 x 1440. I was expecting the screen to go black under the load and have to wait for the auto-revert to kick in, but I was blown away when the changes took affect and I was staring at a beautifully-rendered 3D landscape with a strong FPS counter in the corner. The other thing I noticed when I changed the resolution was how much more of the game was visible. I had roughly a 30% increase in actual viewable display, giving me a much bigger competitive advantage ovr other players. Of course, much of this is attributable to the power of the GPU I'm using, but even before I installed it I was able to get the full resolution through my 4 year old card (just not as responsive).I've been using the monitor for a month now and only have one complaint. The first is that the on button and on screen display controls are not as intuitive as I would like. Since the joystick is on the very bottom of the bezel, it is a little tricky to figure out. Even a month later I still sometimes have trouble trying to turn it off because I move the joystick the wrong way. Also sometimes the joystick on button is not as responsive and doesn't register a push because I haven't pressed hard enough. I feel this could have been designed a little better. Over the next six months, I expect this monitor to drop in price a bit, but if you have the money for it now and do a lot of gaming or photo work and sit close to your screen, this will be one of the most jaw-dropping upgrades you can make to your home system. It is definitely worth the price.","rating":5},{"comment":"Excellent monitor. Just got it. Stunning image quality.","rating":5},{"comment":"The color reproduction on this monitor is *GORGEOUS*.

When using a stylus to write on the screen, it squeaks.  Without the protector, it does not squeak.  3.) Also when using a stylus to write on the screen, it has a &#34;drag&#34; feel to it, not &#34;slick&#34;, and it skips parts of letters when writing.

Great performing CPU, but leaves little room for overclocking.","rating":5},{"comment":"SOME HISTORY-----------------------Essential DIY PC Config:Intel G3220 Dual core (eventually switched to i5-4690)Asrock H81-DGS R2.0 motherboardHynix 4GBx2 Dual channel 1600MHz RAMCrucial M4 256GB SSDAntec 520W Bronze 80+ PSUGTX 660Previously, I used Intel G3220 as I was keen to do some benchmarking for games such as StarCraft 2, World of Warcraft, Diablo 3, Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4 and so on.I found out that Intel G3220 can do most gaming quite efficiently except Battlefield 4 where you sometimes get stutter for 1 or 2s in demanding 64 man map such as Siege of Shanghai. It is playable but you must be very skilled. I always get 100% CPU utilization during game play no matter how big or small the screen size is or graphics setting, change Nvidia control panel to performance, audio setting and whatever setting I can think of.Conclusion: G3220 can support most games including Battlefield 3 1080p Ultra. For more demanding games like Battlefield 4: CPU(G3220) is the bottleneck, FPS in demanding maps can drop to 20+. CPU passmark: 3430.THE PLEASANT SWAP--------------------------------I bought this i5-4690 for US$199 during the price drop (compared around the price and it was the lowest I could get). Finally, the CPU arrived. The stock cooler is slightly different from that of G3220 as it has a copper contact vs. aluminium. I swapped the CPU as well as the stock cooler. The new stock cooler spins slightly faster and noisier though not audible once the casing is closed tight. Process of swap is pretty fast.System refused to boot up after swap. I need to reset the bios settings via changing of jumper on the mother board. System boot up and recognized the CPU. Good. I tried to tweak multicore enhancement, overclocking features and so on but couldn't improve the CPU speed as Intel locked everything under H81 chipset. Single core speed is around 3.85GHz or so, multicore speed can drop to 3.65GHz or so. Not a big deal. I saved quite a lot getting an entry level motherboard as well as this CPU. Eventually, I leave all bios settings to default.Benchmark is surprisingly good. Passmark CPU goes to 8133, better than most Internet posted results. Conclusion: H81 entry level motherboard can actually do at least as good as more expensive ones if you don't need overclocking or more SATA 6gbps ports\/USB 3.0 ports\/SLI. If I use single channel memory, Passmark CPU drops to around 7850 which is pretty good too.The most important test I want to find out is Battlefield 4. I used Task Manager -> Performance as well as MSI Afterburner to track CPU usage and temperature. Indeed, the bottleneck now passes over to GTX 660. At 1080p ultra, GPU utilization is 100%, CPU utilization is mostly 70-80% (sometimes hit 85%) and in demanding maps like 64 man Siege of Shanghai, CPU utilization can hit 90-95% occasionally but mostly 80-85%. FPS is pretty good, 38 to 60 depending on how crowded the map is and how much vertical buildings there are. No stutter like before. While Battlefield 4 is playing you can easily swap out to surf net using Chrome or Internet Explorer without noticeable delay, meaning the multitask is good.Temperature wise is normal. Idle is around 40+ degrees C. During heavy load can hit 72 degree C. I am only using stock cooler. Thermal paste comes with stock cooler so I didn't apply any.Note that this CPU has 4 cores but no hyperthreading. I got another similar setup but using i7-3770 CPU (4 cores with hyperthreading, giving 8 cores). CPU utilization during Battlefield 4 is mostly 60-65% even in Siege of Shanghai 64 man. Hyperthreading does make the CPU faster but not necessary in gaming as i5-4690 does not hit 100% during gameplay. Any CPU will hit 100% utilization during game load easily, so don't worry about that.Power consumption is quite reasonable. At idle, with monitor off, 54.6W low is registered. When GTX 660 is in full blast in Battlefield 4 Siege of Shanghai, total power including LED monitor on is 227W. To be honest, I don't see much power savingsfrom Haswell CPU vs i7-3770. In fact, my i7-3770 during idle can hit slightly less than 51W with monitor off.Conclusion: if you want a budget way to max out most games at 1080p including Battlefield 4, has no wish to overclock and not doing sequential processing stuff that requires hyperthreading, get this CPU.9 June 2014 update------------------Despite i7-3770 being a faster CPU, i5-4690 can actually load Battlefield 4 64 man multiplayer map slightly faster. I suspect i5-4690 has some instruction sets optimally used by the game and these are not available in i7-3770.","rating":5},{"comment":"Super fast, hardy, and the performance is spectacular.

They are loud and don't distort treble and bass, which is excellent, and the sound comes from both ends (if you look at the picture, it basically looks the same on the other side, and produces the same amount of sound). Indoors, they can fill a pretty big space. Outdoors, depending on the space (open space, in a canyon, lots of trees, etc), it varies. If it is for something like a picnic and people will be in a smaller space, less spread out, then you can expect a great experience with loud, clear music. Under other conditions, it might not be quite as good, but even so, these speakers are excellent. Great sound quality, loudness, and for the size, price, and durability these speakers are an excellent buy!","rating":5},{"comment":"With TDK's name on the TREK Max A34, I expected to hear first rate audio, and I did. After pairing the speaker with my Android phone as device &#34;TREK Max,&#34; I streamed some classical music from iHeartRadio, then went through one of my favorite playlists of mixed music. Everything I played sounded excellent. I'm not a hardcore audiophile, but I've been listening to music since the days of 78 RPM phonograph records, so I've played music over a lot of different speakers, and the sound from the TREK Max A34 is as rich as I've heard from a small portable speaker, and at maximum volume, the 15 watts total sound will easily fill any room in most homes. I checked the stereo channel balance and separation and verified that the left and right channels were playing through the corresponding speakers, which they were. The controls are very intuitive for anyone who's familiar with Bluetooth speakers, and none of the controls have the double functions that are so confusing with many portable speakersThe Bluetooth range and stability were good, with a line of sight distance of at least 25-30 feet before I noticed any dropouts. With a couple of interior walls between my phone and the speaker, however, the range was reduced to as little as 20 feet. If you have the speaker paired with your mobile phone, it works as a hands-free device with a built-in microphone. One press of a button on the speaker, and you're connected to an incoming call.The product description refers to the TREK Max 34 as being water resistant with an IP64 rating. International Protection Marking codes, also known as IP codes, classify and rate the degree of protection provided against the intrusion of dust and water by mechanical casings and electrical enclosures. The IP64 rating is fairly high, signifying that the case is dustproof, and that it provides protection against splashing water.I didn't see the capacity of the speaker's built-in battery listed in the user manual or the product description, but the run time is listed as up to 8 hours. I checked this after charging the speaker's battery, and it played for just over 8 hours before the battery died.The TREK Max A34 speaker has the best sound I've heard in a portable speaker in this price range. At 2.7 pounds, it's not as easily portable as smaller speakers weighing less than a pound, but the audio quality more than makes up for the extra weight and size. And with an IP64 rating, it's ideal for dusty or damp conditions.","rating":5},{"comment":"We already owned a Big Jambox, which we love and use all the time.  However, we were anxious to try this out and compare, plus we liked the fact that it's the waterproof model for boating.  INCREDIBLE sound--comparable to our Big Jambox.  Only problem and I am still researching--may be user error--but it paired immediately with my IPad, but I still cannot get it to pair with either of our IPhones. Once I get that resolved, I'll be back to update.July 16, 2014, now that I have had a few weeks to compare these two wireless speakers-I will stick by the quality of TDK, but I have to be honest and tell you there is a reason that Big Jambox is about $100 more.  The sound is better on the Big Jambox speaker-just richer and fuller than the TDK.  Again, if your price range matches the TDK Speaker-have no doubt you are getting a quality speaker with this model--it sounds great.  And the problem I had with pairing was my fault--I needed to hold the button down for my phone to find it--works just great now.","rating":5},{"comment":"Hookup was no problem.

The controls are super easy, and I love that it's &#34;weather proof,&#34; which means it's perfect for taking it to the beach.  Very well done. Highly recommended!","rating":5},{"comment":"The TDK Life on Record TREK Max A34 is the newest version of the TDK A33, a highly-rated Bluetooth speaker that flies somewhat under the radar when compared to speakers from Bose, Jawbone, Ultimate Ears, Sony, and others. I have a number of Bluetooth speakers, including the A33, and count it among my favorites as it produces outstanding sound, is built ruggedly, and gets good battery life.TDK made some changes to the TREK Max A34. The speaker now has near field communications (NFC), so if you have an Android device with NFC pairing is easy. Additionally, TDK added track skip buttons at the top to skip forward or backward quickly through songs, or to skip tracks.  The TREK Max is splash resistant, (P64 certified weatherized design protect against splashing water and dust) and has a jack to charge a USB device, as well as an input for non-Bluetooth devices.Another change from the A33, according to the TDK website, for iDevices (iPhone, iPod, and iPad) the volume controls on the TREK Max and the iDevice are now synced, so changing the volume on either device will change the indicators on the other.From a size and weight perspective, little has changed with the TREK Max A34. It is slightly taller than the A33, and looks a bit sleeker. Both speakers are heavy (the TREK Max A34 is 2.75 pounds) and both are very well built. The A34's rechargeable nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries are replaceable, and on its website TDK says battery life has been improved on the TREK Max (up to eight hours on a single charge).The A34 produces the same outstanding sound as the A33. I have been testing this speaker with a number of different music types, and the A34 performs very well. I would characterize the A34 as a \"warm\" sounding speaker that emphasizes bass. The speaker thumps and vibrates but does not distort, even at very high volumes. Highs are crisp and clear, and mids don't get lost. The speaker does particularly well with genres as R&B; and disco, but does equally well with classical, jazz, and rock. The A34 puts out 15 watts of sound.The TDK A33 is a very good Bluetooth speaker, and the TDK A34 TREK Max continues that excellent tradition. The speaker is very well built, travels well, especially at outdoor events like picnics or the backyard, and produces outstanding room-filling sound. Highly recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"Bought this based on all the 5 star reviews.The unit was shipped promptly and I unpacked it and read the instructions.I plugged the unit into a ac outlet and I got a red light indicating it was charging.14 hours later it was still red and never changed to  amber to indicate it was fully charged, also the bottom was overly hot.I am not sure it if takes longer than 14 hours to fully charge, if it does then i do not want it.I asked for a replacement, and when the replacement arrives and I have to wait for what sems a eternity to charge the unit  then I will ask for a full refund.I will report back when the replacement unit comes, in the meantime I will stick with my reliable Jabra Solemate which has never let  me down.","rating":1},{"comment":"The first thing my industrial designer\/ Marine hubby said when he opened the box was &#34;Wow!&#34; The weight is substantial.

The bass is fantastic, and for a wireless speaker, we're THRILLED with the fullness, depth, of sound. Definitely a big plus in our household. I feel like we'll enjoy it for many years to come. Good job, TDK! We're typically a &#34;Sony&#34; family, so this was quite a surprise that all of us are pleased with this speaker.

I'll update when both of us are listening at once, and see if there's any interference.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a great little bluetooth speaker.  I noticed right away that it feels very solid when you pick it up.  It comes with both bluetooth and NFC pairing.  It paired effortlessly with my Android phone (Samsung Note 3).  On the top are the following controls:  NFC (not a button, you just place your NFC device near the logo and it pairs); Power button; + and - volume controls; Bluetooth button for bluetooth pairing; Phone button used to answer incoming calls (yes you can take calls through this speaker and talk with people); Rewind, Play\/Pause, and Fast Forward buttons.  I wish it had a mute button so you could skip commercials on services like Pandora.I bought my wife a Bose Bose Soundlink Mini for 200 dollars about 6 months ago.  At the time I compared the Bose with a multitude of other speakers from manufacturer's like Logitech, Beats Audio, Jawbone, and a long list of others.  I picked the Bose because I liked its sound the best.  The Bose is smaller than this speaker and just as sturdy.  While this speaker lists for $199 like the Bose Soundlink Mini, you can get it for less than $200 unlike the Bose, which is always $200 so that is a plus.  The Bose does not have the ability to answer calls nor does it support NFC and the Bose is not splash proof.  The Bose does have better sound.  The TDK A34 is very close however.  I would describe the TDK A34's sound as warmer.  It is stronger on the mid range tones and slightly weaker on the bass and higher tones.  At $50 less than the Bose, it would be a tough choice on which to pick.  If you are a sound purist, who doesn't need the NFC, splash proof, or the ability to answer calls and you don't mind paying $50 more, go with that.  If these other features appeal to you, you won't be missing much in sound with this speaker.  It is very close to the Bose.  I also think it is a bit louder than the Bose, so if you like to play your music loud, it would be the better choice.There are a few things I found annoying.  It has the usual wall wart (the large plug that you plug directly into the power).  It would have been nice if they had put this inline, so you don't have to have this up against your wall plugs).  There is also a rubber guard (part of the splash proofing) that protects the power connector, the usb port, etc.  I found this rubber plug a bit annoying to get off to plug the speaker in.  Luckily you won't need it much because the speaker has great battery life.","rating":5},{"comment":"I was a little nervous at first, thinking I received a unit that was DOA.According to the manual, the light changes from red to amber when fully charged. Mine never did, the light just went out. Not a huge issue, but then it wouldn't power on, even after the side toggle was in an 'on' position. I kept pressing the top power button. Turns out it just needs a very light, quick tap, not a press.It immediately and automatically synced itself to my nearby phone. I started playing from my Amazon download list, and then Pandora.You can get a pretty high distortion free volume from this unit. It has a nice, full sound. When in the pool, you can reach over to adjust the volume or change the song without worrying about your wet hands. BIG plus.","rating":5},{"comment":"If you're like me, you've noticed a deluge of bluetooth speakers hitting the stores.  I've tried to listen to almost everyone of them, and I noticed a weird phenomenon.  The best speakers I've tested aren't from the big companies like Beats, Jawbone, or Bose.  The best bluetooth speakers are from relatively little-known companies with diminutive marketing budgets.  The best bluetooth speakers I've tested are from companies like UE(Ultimate Ears), House of Marley, and Sony--Sony being the only large company.  I've owned thousands of TDK products in my life--all of them being storage media (eg. Cr02 blank cassettes, CD-R and DVD-R).  I've never owned or thought to own an electronics product created by TDK.  Considering the trend, then this should be the best bluetooth speaker I've ever tested.  Let's find out.The first thing I noticed was just how small this speaker is.  It's a tad smaller than the Bose Soundlink III.  The second thing I noticed was how heavy this speaker is.  A lot of industrial engineering has been put to good use here.  The weight is very evenly distributed side-to-side and top-to-bottom.  This speaker feels like a high quality product the second you hold it.  Majority of the surface of the speaker is a thick metal grill that wraps around the front and back of the speakers.  The remainder of the speaker is a combination of piano-black edging and firm silicon.  The silicon is important for sealing the speaker from water.  This is a weather resistant speaker.  It's not rated for submersion, but it can handle the incidental raindrops and poolside splash.  On the top, there is a very efficient button-array.  There are the requisite bluetooth, power, and volume buttons.  Additionally, there is a phone button which makes answering calls very convenient.  The speaker performs very well as a speakerphone.  There are next and previous track buttons, as well as a pause\/play button.  Pretty much every button you will need and nothing else.  This speaker additionally support NFC for easy syncing.  Just tap the back of your phone on the NFC label, and your phone or portable music player will link up with the speaker.  On the side, there is a usb (power only) port for charging devices.  It's not the 2.0 amps that I'd prefer, but it provides a serviceable 1.0 amps of current.  This isn't a gig though because 1 amp is plenty enough to maintain your phone's charge while streaming media.  There is also a 3.5mm jack for those who want to use a cable for connecting to this speaker.  Before I go into the sound quality, I wanted to cover a couple of other quick specifications.  The first is that this speaker only supports bluetooth 2.1.  I'd prefer bluetooth 4.0 for the energy efficiency or bluetooth 3.0 for the larger bandwidth, but the implementation of bluetooth 2.1 does not adversely effect the performance of this speaker--in terms of both sound and battery life.  This speaker lasts about 8 hours on battery,  and the volume is not throttled down when running on battery like many other devices I've tested.  To sum up the looks and specs, this speaker has pretty much everything you need and nothing you don't in a very small and high-quality package.The sound is where this speaker just floored me.  First off, this speaker is LOUD, and as I mentioned during my rundown of the specs, the volume does not throttle on battery.  The speaker is ridiculously loud whether on battery or plugged into an outlet.  Not only is this speaker ridiculously loud, but the sound also travels.  Not just the highs or just the lows, but the entire sound spectrum travels, so if you are in a large open area, this speaker will fill the space with ease.  Although not truly omni-directional, this speaker does provide good sound all around the speaker.  This speaker uses three separate drivers.  Two subwoofers for the lows, and one multi-gradient driver for the mids and highs.  The two bass exhausts are located on the back-side of the speaker.  So now that I've covered the quantity of sound, let's examine the quality of sound.  Prior to getting my hands on the TDK TREK, my three favorite bluetooth speakers were the UE Boom, House of Marley Get Together, and the Sony SRSX7.  I am not a huge fan of Bose, Jawbone or Beats speakers.  Bose is the best of these overpriced marketing baubles, and the Soundlink III is a vast improvement over the Soundlink II, but I find my three favorites to far exceed the Bose speakers in value and in performance.  I won't even go into what I think of Jawbone and Beats.  So where does this TDK fit in?  Well, I'm happy to report that this is, in my opinion, the new king of sound in the bluetooth speaker market.  Everything is there: the highs are crystal, the mids are rich, and the bass is thumping.  This speaker is beautifully tuned, and the sound integrity is maintained at all volumes.  No distortion was audible even at maximum volume.  Every song I throw at it sounds good--classic rock, classical, modern rock, pop, hip-hop.  It really is remarkable how such a rich and powerful sound emanates from such a small device.  Simply sublime.So let's wrap this up.  We have here a speaker that lasts 8 hours on battery, is weatherproof, has all the necessary features, sounds better than any bluetooth speaker out there, and comes in a slick ultra-portable form factor.  What am I forgetting?  Oh yeah, and it's currently selling for half the price of its more expensive rivals.  If you are even thinking about buying a bluetooth speaker, give this a go.  With this speaker, you can have your cake and eat it too.","rating":5},{"comment":"In the last couple years, I&#8217;ve reviewed new fewer than six bluetooth speakers. It seems that every electronics manufacturer wants in on this new trend. Some of these speakers require AC power (like certain models by Panasonic and Hercules) and many are battery powered (like those by Jawbone, Bose, Klipsch, and Edifier). Now I&#8217;ve received the TDK TREK Max for review, so &#8230; let the comparisons begin!First of all, this is the only speaker of the (now seven) models I&#8217;ve tested that is &#8220;weatherproof.&#8221; It&#8217;s unclear what weatherproof means, since it changes depending upon what part of the literature you read. In some places, like the product listing, the speaker is able withstand &#8220;the harshest conditions.&#8221; In other places, like the manual, it&#8217;s merely water-resistant. I would guess that this can get a little rain water blown on it, but submerging it in a pool or a bathtub is probably not a good idea. At any rate, you can take this outside without worrying if it gets a little banged up, apparently.In terms of size, weight, and loudness potential, this sits somewhere between the Jawbone Jambox (smaller, ca. $150), the Klipsch Gig (same size, $200), the Bose Soundlink (same size, $300), and the Edifier MP260 (smaller, $100). Each of these are functionally similar, and most allow you to receive calls, thereby acting as a fancy speakerphone. Each claim to offer around 8 hours of battery life on a single charge.Within these similar products, there is a surprisingly large range in terms of sound quality. The Jambox sounds good, but it&#8217;s smaller and not as loud. The Bose has a characteristically bright sound that appeals mostly to older listeners who have some naturally-occuring hearing loss in the upper frequencies. The Edifier is the smallest and quietest with the weakest bass response. The Klipsch, to my ears, offers the most neutral sound with a wonderful, well-balanced midrange and a full sounding low end.Where then does the TDK TREK Max fit in this spectrum? In terms of sound quality, it&#8217;s not stellar. The highs sound muffled, as if someone had placed a heavy blanket over the tweeters. (To be clear, this system uses full range drivers, so there aren&#8217;t actually tweeters. This is just to illustrate how the highs sound muffled). The midrange is a little better, and the lower you get in the frequency spectrum, the more clear the speakers sound. The bass is surprisingly present. It&#8217;s not a huge system, but the amount of bass it produces belies is actual size.The real place where the TDK excels is in volume level. This plays a lot louder than you would expect. It&#8217;s certainly enough to fill a regular-sized room. You lose some of the impact when you take this outdoors, but this is natural. Without reflective surfaces, the sound just radiates into the atmosphere. However, since it produces a fairly powerful sound in and of itself, it should play satisfactorily loud (for most people) outside. I didn&#8217;t have any complaints.Not much is provided in the way of accessories. Many of the speakers I&#8217;ve mentioned come with bags for carrying, but not the TDK. It&#8217;s not a huge deal, but it&#8217;s a point of comparison. The supplied documentation is fine. Nothing too verbose, but it tells you what you need to know.One thing that I like are the controls. Too many of these speakers rely on only a few buttons that have numerous functions. The Klipsch is particularly annoying in this regard because it has, essentially, one button that does everything. Thus, you end up having to hold it in different places for varying amounts of time. I hate that. Give me different buttons for different functions! The TDK has all the buttons that I want to see on a bluetooth speaker: power, volume, pairing, and a few others. You turn the unit on, press the pairing button, and it connects quickly and easily.In terms of sound quality, I would highly recommend the Klipsch because even though its controls annoy me, it produces a beautiful, well-balanced sound with plenty of volume. However, if you want to use your bluetooth speaker outside and don&#8217;t want to worry about shielding it from the elements, this is a reasonable compromise. In this case, it&#8217;s not so much about the sound quality as it is about the convenience of having a weatherproof\/resistant speaker. Since I see no reason to spend more on a Jawbone or a Bose, I can recommend this pretty easily.Basically, you need to figure out what you want from your bluetooth speaker. If you want something that sounds good, get the Klipsch Gig. If you&#8217;re elderly, get the Bose. If you want something stylish, get the Jawbone. If you want something for outdoors, get the TDK.","rating":4},{"comment":"Here are 10 Reasons I love this Battery And recommend it to You:1) The battery reflects a sleek and minimalistic design.2) Includes a convenient wrap around the battery cable for convenient access.3) Contains a soft-edge surface so it will not scratch other products when placed in a briefcase\/purse, etc. for storage.4) Compatible with all major cell phone models - I-Phones 5\/5S, 4\/4S (as well as I-pods); Samsung Galaxy, S5, S4, HTC One and Google Nexus LG.5) The battery has several &#34;smart&#34; features including: temperature control to protect the battery from your phone's battery or other electrical dangers; and an intelligent circuit that will prevent the battery from self-charging when the micro USB is plugged into both ports.6) It contains a smart sleep mode in order to save the batteries power life.7) Takes about 8 hours to fully charge the battery - and the battery will give about 4 full charges to your phone.8) It provides a 90% conversion rate which means it will provide more power than most batteries (10 to 20% better than the market average).9) The lighting on the battery is easy to see - when fully charged all four lights will be visibly solid.10) This battery is powerful, affordable, and dependable!","rating":5},{"comment":"This is the External Battery UNIT to buy.  It should reach Amazon's 'Best Seller' mark in the division of External Batteries.  I've gone through 6 other units.  This is the best one.  I've been charging my Note 3 when it's down to about 20% battery THREE Times to 100% before having to recharge my Simplicity 7800mAh.  I wanted to give it a good long run for it's money before posting a review.I'll never buy a standard sized 2700mAH, or 3100mAH unit again.  This unit is way more functional, doesn't seem much bulkier, & has a smooth color\/ sleek shape.  It is an ample amount of power\/ saves time.. no need to charge it constantly like smaller mAH units.  It stays fully charged for a long time if left unused.  It had all four bars after 10 days of not using it.Besides that, it works flawlessly.  Plus, it has gorgeous mini white LED's to show it's status.  I keep this in my Car's console and charge my phone some nights when my Car is off (I sleep better without a phone in the house).Another GREAT thing about this unit is the Cord!  It has a built in Cord that stores unto itself.  This is not a gimmick.... works great (good design) and can be completely removed.This Unit is Better than I had expected & is High Quality Craftsmanship.Please click, 'Yes' if this is helpful..","rating":5},{"comment":"I am using this external battery with an iPhone 5s. Because I have a lightening cord apple product I need to use my own cord with this device, which is no problem for me because I prefer to use apple only cords. This unit is very sleek and &#34;hip&#34; in appearance. I think it would satisfy any gear lover or tech freak. I like the built in power cords so I can easily attach it to my computer for recharge.I was able to charge my phone 4 times with this charger ( It is important to note here that I am charging from 20%, not from any red zone power area- if I were to be charging from the red zone I would get less than 4 charges. I would guess 3 because an apple product takes much more energy to charge from red than it does from green). I then plugged into my computer and the unit recharged itself in about 2.5 hours. It does have a built in no overcharge feature so I would really recommend just plugging this in at night.The unit it extremely portable with barely any added weight when thrown into a work bag or backpack.I highly recommend this unit that I was gifted in exchange for an honest review.","rating":5},{"comment":"I own two other external batteries that I've used for a couple of years, and both have their drawbacks (take a long time to re-charge, capacity is limited, etc.).  This unit seems to solve all those problems for me.I used this with my iPhone 5S (lightning) and a Photive CYREN Portable Bluetooth Speaker (micro-USB)First, it's easy to recharge the Simplicity using either your computer (I used my MacBook Pro) or a USB wall charger.  The wrap-around cable detaches easily and plugs right into the USB port; the micro-USB plugs right into the Simplicity battery unit.  I plug it in at night, and it's fully charged ready to go by morning.Once charged, it will work with any device that uses a micro-USB cable (using the included cable), OR your own lightning cable for iPhone.The recharge rate for the iPhone is VERY fast -- much better than I expected.  And I was able to charge my phone 4 times before running out of juice from the Simplicity unit.For the speaker, I was able to get 3 full charges before the Simplicity needed to be recharged.  The speaker has a large battery capacity (will run the speaker for 8-10 hours), so I feel that getting 3 full charges is excellent performance.Then there's the design -- sleek, stylish, minimal.  The gray cable wraps around the unit securely, and the entire effect is chic and classy.  Its small size makes it highly portable -- I can slip it into my purse or overnight bag, and although it has a bit of weight to it (it is, after all, a battery), it's not bad at all.This is a high quality well-performing external battery.  Definitely recommended!

Its large 7800mAh capacity will fully charge an iPhone several times.I charged a Kindle Fire HD (1st gen) & a Fire HDX when they  both had about 50% power left. The Simplicity charged them both to 100% & had power left.It has a 90% conversion rate which means the Simplicity @ 7800mAh, 90% conversion, will provide more charges than a 7800mAh with a 70 - 80% conversion. (You will receive closer to the 7800mAh charging capacity. I hope that makes sense, it's hard for me to explain)One time, my Fire HDX was at 14% - in an 1h 20m, the Simplicity had the HDX battery charged to  62%...that was fast! The Simplicity's output is 2.1A.Fully charge before first use.To check for battery life,  press the power button, the 4 LED lights  will indicate the remaining battery level in the portable charger. It will need to be recharged if no LEDs are lit. I usually recharge it when only one LED lights up.Charge the Simplicity by plugging the micro USB into the Simplicity & the USB into your laptop or AC USB Wall Charger (recommended for faster charging).When the Simplicity is charging, the LED light\/s will start blinking. When it is full, all four lights will appear solid.When the Simplicity was depleted & needed to be recharged, it took about 7 - 7 1\/2 hours to fully charge it using an AC wall charger.I absolutely love the wrap around micro USB cable. It is so convenient & doesn't come off in my purse.If you use the Simplicity with an Apple product or a product that doesn't use a micro USB, you will need to supply your own cable.Safety Features: The intelligent circuit prevents the battery from self-charging when the micro USB is plugged into both ports. Automatic temperature control to protect the battery against electrical hazards to protect the phone's battery.Lepow thinks of everything, they even use direct color injection molding (reduces the spraying process) which is more eco friendly. And, the Simplicity's  ergonomic design fits my hand perfectly; it is very comfortable to hold.Measurements & Weight (approximate):7.1oz7 1\/4\" long x 2\" - 2 1\/4\" at widest point x 1\" thick5 stars, if my opinion changes, I'll update my review.In the next few days, I'll upload a video showing the Simplicity at work.review sample provided","rating":5},{"comment":"Works as advertised.

No gaming, no CAD files or large Photoshop or audio-video project creation. BUT, it is _exactly_ what my wife needed to replace her 8-year-old Toshiba Satellite, though. After configuring Windows 8.1 to get rid of the awful &#34;Modern&#34; interface and Start Page, she is very pleased with it. This notebook is perfect for someone whose computer use is built around Office app use (I installed a licensed copy of M$Office 2010 for compatibility with her standard work environment), cruising the web, downloading and viewing (and even light manipulation) of video\/audio\/camera, etc. files, email, social networking and more: just ordinary, everyday use. For her, it's a perfect fit. Little quibbles? Sure, but nothing overwhelming. I didn't like the way the charging cord stuck out in a more than 2&#34; protrusion (just begging for a damaged charging port), so I added a little right-angle adapter that cut the protrusion down to a safer (in my view) 3\/4&#34;. Win 8.1 interface on a non-touchscreen computer, as noted above, is pretty annoying--especially to someone like my wife who really, REALLY will ONLY use desktop apps with the thing. *meh* A couple of minutes configuring Win 8.1 to make the &#34;Modern&#34; interface just go away, and the computer now has no flaws in her eyes.KEY: NOT a gaming or audio\/video\/Photoshopping computer--nothing requiring heavy number-crunching. EXCELLENT for quotidian computing. Her big &#34;Likes&#34;? The screen\/display; the keyboard (especially since her former Satellite lacked a number pad: helps when she's modding an Excel file from work).

Her supervisor provided her with a Dell notebook to use, taking her work between schools and for use at home when working on school work--also a Win 8.1 compy.

I know whats a good buy and whats not. This laptop I would say is a good buy. Just like with everything else there are pros and cons to this laptop.The model I have is the Toshiba C55T A5123 ( 500 GB HDD, 2.13 GHz Processor, 4 GB Ram, Touch screen capabilities )The only difference between the C55T A5123 and the C55 A5105 is that the C55T is touchscreen.The pros on this laptop are...Keyboard is nicely laid out (in my opinion) I really like how it has the number pad and how the keys are shapedI LOVE the mouse pad not to big not to small and the left and right click buttons are big :) way better than a all in one mouse padTouch screen on this laptop is a very nice touch for the priceSpeakers are LOUDThis laptop has pretty decent specs (4 GB Ram, 500 GB Hard drive, duel core processor clocked at 2.13 GHz, Screen is not to bad of a resolution 1366 x 768)Price is awesome $400.00CONSThere is only ONE ram slot which makes it harder to upgrade the ramCan be slow at timesA little bit big not as thin as some laptopsbattery life is only about 4 1\/2 hoursSpeakers arnt the best if you have them to loud it distorts the qualityOverall I really do like this laptop:) its not painfully slow or to high priced. This laptop is fast for watching YouTube, going on Amazon, and overall fast on the internet. One thing that really bummed me out on this thing is it only having ONE ram slot. That means at most only 8 GB can be installed on this thing. I really do enjoy the texture on it and the touch screen its very handy when it comes to using windows 8. Honestly if your PC (laptop or desktop) dont have a touch screen I think windows 8 is useless. Without a touch screen it makes it harder to get around in the operating system, just trying to use the \"charms bar\" is a pain with the mouse and keyboard. You can get to the charms bar by pressing the windows key and C but I wouldnt want to do that all the time just to bring up the charms bar. Windows 8 on this laptop functions pretty well. Its snappy when it comes to booting up and loading programs and fun to use for the most part. I think in general windows 7 is better set up, the overall layout is attractive and built more towards using a keyboard and mouse. Windows 7 I think is more organized than Windows 8. In Windows 8 you have to swipe up to see ALL your programs and keep on swiping to the left to get to that one program you want to use whereas in Windows 7 you click the start button to see all your programs and they are all right there in folders. You click on the folder your program is in and its right there. You dont have to swipe 3 or 4 times looking at every single program just to find that one thing you want. In Windows 8 your programs are all categorized either by name, date installed, most used or by category. I also dont like how they try to simplify things like the weather app how its just a circle with lines. It looks childish and unsophisticated. They could of taken the time to make it look better. Windows 8 is a little glitchy sometimes but it has only been out for about a year and a half so that is understandable. It sometimes randomly switches me to different apps when I am on my desktop. I dont hate windows 8 at all I just think Microsoft could of done better. Maybe if Microsoft would of made a desktop version of Windows 8 and a tablet version. Putting back the start button in on the desktop and laptop versions and maybe making Windows 8 more graphical. I really did enjoy the windows being transparent in the Windows 7 operating system.I hope this is at least somewhat helpful and please forgive me for any grammar errors or miss spellings.Spelling is not at all my strong suit LOL","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a nice specialized Bluetooth for applications like cycling.

In actuality, this product can be placed on a chair, a tree limb, or any other odd shaped apparatus.One of the things I really like about this product is that its color can be changed.  The default color of my speaker was red.  Inside the packaging is silicon sleeving in the colors of green, black, and blue.  This means that you can make the color of your speaker either red, green, black, or light blue.  Another thing that I really like is that it has a Micro SD slot which makes it like an MP3 player.This bluetooth speaker device is shaped like a cylinder. One end of the cylinder is the speaker output.  The other end of the cylinder contains the power input, audio input, the ON\/OFF switch, and the Micro SD slot.Playing the device requires pressing and holding the play\/pause button for about 5 seconds.  The play\/pause button is on the long end of the device up from the on\/off switch.  A 5 second press on the play\/pause switch toggles the speaker to ON\/OFF.To increase\/decrease the volume, press the plus minus keys on the long end of the speaker nearest to the power plug.This product comes with a USB charge cable, but not the DC end that goes into the wall. A kindle charger or Samsung phone charger should work though.  It also comes with an AUX (line in) cable, which allows you to use the device as a direct connection to the audio source instead of using bluetooth.  Another bonus is that this product comes with a micro SD card which allows a person to play music without the need of getting the music from a phone or direct wiring an aux cable.Given that this bluetooth will work with a micro SD card, this product is well suited bike riding.I tested the speaker by connecting to my cell phone and listening to something from audible. The speaker sound quality is better than my phone's sound quality.Another interesting concept about this product is its flexibility of where it can be used (on a tree branch, on a chair leg, on a stair rail, etc.).[sample provided]","rating":5},{"comment":"My wife wanted a Bluetooth speaker to attach to her bike while cycling. There were three models that I was considering which had the same exact speaker shape\/design (OT Buckshot, Ivation Bullet and Joyiqi), but they had slightly different functionalities. Of the three, the Buckshot was the most expensive and Joyiqi was the cheapest. I bought both the Buckshot and Joyiqi and the Joyiqi was a much better product.  I wrote a similar review as below for the Buckshot (Outdoor Tech OT1301 Buckshot Super-Portable Rugged Water-Resistant Wireless Bluetooth Speaker (Glo)).Pros of Joyiqi:- Has microSD card slot. Both Joyiqi and Ivation Bullet have this, but Buckshot does not.- Bluetooth pairing is a breeze. It has abutton dedicated to Bluetooth pairing AND pressing this pairing button initiates an elegant voice that tells you whether the speaker is ready for pairing or if the speaker has paired successful. Very nice touch.  On the Buckshot there aren't many buttons so one button has to serve several functions. The button for pairing is the same as the power on\/off, call answer\/end and song play\/pause. For pairing you have to long-press this button and wait for two lights on either side of the button to flash to notify you when the product is ready for pairing (there is no voice notification). Since the buttons and lights are small, your finger covers the lights so you can't see when the product is ready for pairing. Very poor design on the Buckshot.- Lots of large buttons for direct access to controls which makes using Joyiqi easy and quick to operate.  The Buckshot has fewer and smaller buttons that are hard to use. Most bike riders will mount the product on the bike's handlebar with speaker facing them. Since the Buckshot's buttons are located on the opposite end of the speaker they won't be visible to the rider. That means the rider has to \"feel\" for the button they want to press which can be frustrating at times.  The Buckshot's Previous\/Next song control requires long press of the volume buttons. This is time consuming. When riding a bike you don't want your hands away from the handlebar more than necessary since it becomes a safety issue.- Comes with 4 covers and 4 straps, just like the Ivation Bullet.  The Buckshot only comes with one outside cover and one rubber strap.-  Covers and straps are color-matched which look nicer than the Buckshot when mounted.  The Buckshot only has one strap that comes in black which totally ruins the aesthetics (unless you order a black cover).- Highs and mids sound good and are clear and loud enough for cycling in areas without a lot of traffic. Bass isn't great, but I didn't expect much from a speaker this size so no problems there. The sound volume and clarity are the same on both the Buckshot and Joyiqi.- Cheapest of the speakers that share the same shape\/design.Cons of Joyiqi:- No microphone for speakerphone functionality.  I do wish the Joyiqi had a microphone for speakerphone functionality.  I'd even pay more for it.- Not weather resistant, but not a huge deal since I can easily put in my bag if it starts raining while cycling.- Outside cover is not as thick and sturdy as the Buckshot.Overall, the Joyiqi is a much cheaper, easier to use than the Buckshot while having the same sound volume and clarity. I'm guessing the Ivation Bullet functions\/performs exactly as the Joyiqi, but at a price point halfway between the Joyiqi and Buckshot.  I wish the Joyiqi had a microphone for speakerphone functionality.  I'd have given it 5 stars if it had a microphone. I hope this review helps other folks out there deciding which of the three similarly shaped\/designed products to buy.","rating":4},{"comment":"I really, really like Joyiqi's Portable Bicycle Speaker. It's a great way to listen to music while cycling. I love the safety aspect of this speaker. No one should use earbuds to listen to music while cycling...it's not safe. You need to hear what's happening around you & ear buds might interfere with your ability to hear traffic noises around you.The Joyiqi Bicycle Speaker is wireless. You have 3 listening options: Bluetooth, Micro SD Card & Aux input using the included AUX Line-In Cable. The speaker gets very loud so you should be able to hear your music under most circumstances. There are 4 color choices, Red, Black, Lime Green & Sky Blue. Each skin has a matching silicone mount. There's also a wrist strap. I am using the wrist strap. That way, I can take the speaker off my bike when it's parked to help prevent theft. The strap makes it easier for me to carry the speaker with me.Fully charge the speaker before first use. The red LED is lit while charging & goes out when fully charged.I tested the Joyiqi with my Kindle Fire HDX. It connected to Bluetooth easily. I was able to Play\/Pause & Control Volume using the buttons. Also, I could begin a song over by pushing the Previous button once; pushing it twice changed the song. The Next button worked the same way. (short & long clicks also work). Finding the button you need while biking will be difficult until you become familiar with their placement on the sleeve.I plan on adding music to a MicroSD card, that way I can leave my MP3 player at home.This speaker can be used in various ways...it's not just for cycling. You can use it the same way you'd use any speaker & it can be strapped to tree branches or polls, etc.  If Bluetooth or a MicroSD card isn't available, you can connect your MP3 player to the Joyiqi by using the AUX in with the included cable.The Speaker sounds good for the price; music & voices are clear - not at all mushy. Bass is decent. Really it's a great speaker & should be able to be heard under most biking conditions. Some are using it on motorcycles & are satisfied with it too.The easiest way for me to change the skin was to fold the top about halfway back, then position the cutouts close to the proper area & push, tug & pull to get the sleeve on. If you use the wrist strap, I suggest you attach it before putting the sleeve on the speaker.review sample provided","rating":5},{"comment":"This little unit produces big sound and has a rugged case. it comes with different &#34;skins&#34; so you can make it the color you want.

They've gone through various ones too.  Because of that, I ended up purchasing the same style case for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1.Everything I liked about the iPad Mini case applies to the Galaxy Tab 4 case.- The construction is done well (good quality leather, excellent stitching).  The case just feels good in your hand and there are no \"weaknesses\" to the make of the product.  My mother's iPad case is still going strong even after a year and a half of usage!- The free stylus is a great addition for those times when you need to use a stylus.- The kickstand feature is great. Allows you to prop your tablet up (which is harder to do than a phone) to watch your videos.- Although I don't plan on putting my credit cards or ID in the card holder as pictured, I did end up putting a business card in there (in case I lose my tablet).- Best feature of all, is the magnetic closure.  It snaps shut and stays shut, but on top of that... just like the iPad's case, it turns off your display when you close it and turns it back on when you open.  My wife owns a case with her iPad 3 and her case does NOT turn her display off!This case can be had for $7.95 (that's how much I paid for it on Amazon).  For an ~$8, this cannot be beat.  It even comes with a 3 year warranty.  In the event that it breaks down, I'll probably buy another one.

One of my key complaints about most headphones is that they are uncomfortable. After listening to these for an hour, I was ready for more. Obviously, they won't work for laying down unless you have a really soft pillow to lay on.They curl up into a nice little roll to fit in my pocket, they charge using a standard micro cord, the sound is clear and the stereo balanced, and best of all, the settings are raised so I can tell what they are and where they are.If you have ever tried to answer your phone or control your earphones, you know exactly what I mean about that being important!The up\/down sound found on the edge is nice and gives a beep when you go up or down, giving a long beep when you have achieved the maximum.After testing these on various music types, they are overall sound with good round tones. While the bass is there, You don't get loud drum beats on your rock and roll. It is more subtle. The stereo is balanced, and you can clearly hear the difference when listening.There are no instructions - just a guide to the buttons on the outside of the box. The one thing that would have been helpful would have been instructions on synching the Bluetooth. If I hadn't already experienced it, I would have been clueless. You synch this by holding the MFB button (???) which is shaped like a telephone until the blue\/red light flashes and it appears in your Bluetooth panel on your phone\/tablet.Except for that, having the information on the buttons was more than sufficient.It seems to have a long charge, although there is no way of determining how full the battery is and no flashing buttons to tell you wen it is charged that I was able to see.When I tested it for distance, it began to break up at about 20 feet, although I could walk behind a wall and still pick it up (confession time - yes, I could walk into my bathroom and still hear my music).I received a complimentary set to test for my review and am very happy to report on my good experiences with them.

Let me start off by saying that for many people (as evidenced by the existing reviews), this will be a five star product hands-down. For me, however, it's coming in at four stars, and I'll explain why below. The manufacturer sent me a sample of this product, this review is my honest opinion.Let's start of with where this product shines, and that's function. I found the audio quality to be really excellent, and perhaps even better than the price tag on these headphones would merit. Bass is nice a full, highs are crisp without being tinny, and there is no crackling at high volumes. Bluetooth range is very good - I can't tell you exactly what it will be like for you, but in my 1200 sq. ft. open-plan apartment I can roam around without any interference whatsoever.The controls are not difficult to use, but it will take a few uses to get used to the placement, as with any such device. Pairing with my iPhone was simple, and I appreciate that it takes advantage of iOS' built in battery meter for bluetooth, something not all manufacturers seem to know or care about. Incoming audio quality on calls is excellent, outgoing I am told is decent but obviously not as good as speaking directly into the headset, but better than speakerphone. I'm thankful for friends who I can call and will put up with the MANY \"Hey I'm calling you to test out bluetooth quality\" calls the get :PNow, here's where the headset loses a star, FOR ME. I honestly do not find them comfortable. I don't have a particular wide head or humongous ears or anything like that, so I was a little surprised to find that nearly everyone else though they were very comfortable. After about 20 minutes of use, I start to feel a little discomfort, after an hour I have to take them off! I owned headphones with this sport style before, and have had similar issues. Still, there you have it - the reason I'm not giving them five stars. Again, this is a personal thing, and many people find them to be super comfortable! With Amazon's excellent return policy, I would suggest still giving them a try and returning them if they're not comfortable for you - everything else about them is highly satisfactory.Overall, an excellent product that just doesn't quite work for me. The quality of the electronics is above-par, the audio quality is excellent and if it wasn't for my finding it uncomfortable to use, these would easily become my workout headphones.Four out of five stars, I can easily recommend you give them a shot and see if they work for you!","rating":4},{"comment":".** 2-month update -- I use these every day.

I tend to prefer in-ear headphones for when I&#8217;m moving around since on-ear designs, such as this, usually move around a bit on my ear, making them uncomfortable. This design, however, is far more comfortable than the typical on-ear headphone.They stay put pretty well while exercising, but there are limits &#8211; they don&#8217;t have as secure a fit as an in-ear headphone when you move your head quickly. But for activities up to and including a slow jog they proved to be secure and comfortable.The build quality feels substantial. While they are lightweight enough that you don&#8217;t really notice them (at least to a distracting level), the cups and the cords feel sturdy enough to deal with some measure of punishment without breaking. They are attractively designed &#8211; I have the red version, and the red and black contrast looks really nice and a lot more stylish than the typical bluetooth headset.Pairing was quick and easy with a couple of different tablets I tried them with. They have a good range, with zero dropouts at a 20'ish foot distance from the tablet.Operation is also straightforward. All the control buttons are on the right earcup. While the buttons could be better defined so you can find them by touch, they are arranged in a logical pattern so that after a few minutes of use you get familiar with quickly finding the button you need.The sound quality is pretty good, especially with regard to clarity. The bass response is not what I&#8217;d call thrilling, but there&#8217;s enough to round out the sound. Since these are an on-ear design the sound isolation is only fair. The volume range is decent, and adequate for comfortable use even in a loud environment (such as a gym).While these are a bit more expensive than the lower-end on-ear bluetooth headsets I&#8217;ve used, the build quality is better, and they certainly look a lot more sleek and stylish than cheaper sets. My overall rating is 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5 since they are so comfortable and lightweight. Well worth considering if you&#8217;re looking for a headset for the gym or any other active use.[Sample provided for review]","rating":5},{"comment":"When I opened up the box with this Swage headset, the first thing I thought was HOW SMALL it is.

They are so lightweight, with soft ear padding, that they feel comfortable for hours.  They don't hurt my ears from their weight pressing down.  And, despite my small ears, they stay pretty much in place, even during a lengthy, brisk walk.  I'd even go so far as to say that these seem like the best option for women who want this style since so many other brands seem designed for larger heads and ears.The sound quality is pretty darn good, too.  No hiss.  A good balance of bass and treble. Clear vocals. Like others that fit this way, they does lose some quality and volume because they don't press firmly against the ear; however, this is how ear-looping headphones work.  The Bluetooth range for my iPhone is only 10 feet or so, but I've learned that's a limitation of the phone, since the range with my iPad is closer to the standard 33 feet.Once I discovered that the fit, comfort, and sound quality were up-to-par, I found other things to love about these.  When not in use, they automatically curl up into a palm-size circle.  Because the behind-the-head piece doesn't stick out, I can lean back in my chair without popping the headphones off my ears.  And I like the red-and-black styling.  The only thing I'd put on my wish list for improvements would be an included case to keep them protected between uses.

If you are planning of using these at the gym for a low-impact workout they&#8217;d be perfect.

Simply pull the earphones apart, swing them to the back of the head and up and over each ear. Once I had them on properly no way would they move.The sound? It has an excellent soundstage, although not something the dedicated audiophile would jump at. I&#8217;m totally enjoying these when I want to listen to music or my news without disturbing anyone else in the house.

They start out without this discomfort, but within half an hour I start to notice how it is feeling.  If I adjust them so they aren't being uncomfortable, then they don't stay in place.I still use them, but I will eventually find another set to try as the comfort problems will ultimately drive me away from them for workout uses.

These can easily be put right in your pocket.But don't let their small size fool you...these have a very strong and bold sound, whether you are listening to music, or just talking on the phone.BTW, I have been having a lot of trouble finding a bluetooth set (or any set) that would allow me to talk, and hear clearly on my IPhone. I have trouble hearing most voices on headsets, and I am starting to think it is my hearing &#60;sigh&#62;. I am still in denial, so I just keep trying different headsets. ;-)Well, guess what...I can hear again!! This set has very good sound clarity, that allows me to actually hear people speaking. Since I am on the phone a lot, this is very important to me. I am very happy with the quality.Some other positives are that the set is very good looking, and easily paired with my iPhone 5S.They are super comfortable, and you can wear them for hours. They fit well and are perfect for the gym, or just on a jog or walk. Although they are quiet, you can still hear a little traffic...which I feel is important if you are going to be out in the street.The controls on one side of the set are so easy to use. You can feel the buttons which allow you to change the volume, turn the phone on and off (or headset) and also go to the next song or last song. There is even a light to let you know when you are low on power.Another cool feature is the USB port has a little cover on it, to keep it Dust as well as Waterproof.

My first concern was how well they would stay in place, but they actually fit much better than I expected, and they seemed to be fairly secure from slipping off.The headphones paired easily with my Kindle Fire HDX 7&#34; as device &#34;Swage Sport.&#34; The audio sounded very good to my ears. I have a few MP3s that I use to evaluate headsets and speakers. The headset passed the test, with excellent sound for songs like Annie Lennox's &#34;Love Song For A Vampire&#34; (listen for the heartbeat in the background) and The Surfaris' &#34;Wipe Out&#34; with drummer Ron Wilson's continuous drum riff. I used two stereo setup MP3s to check the stereo balance and channel separation, and the headphones passed with flying colors.The controls are on the right earpiece. It takes a little practice to learn to use the controls by feel, but by the end of the playlist I used, I had it down fairly well. A rocker switch on the top of the earpiece controls the volume. On the left and right sides are the controls for next track and back to beginning of the current track. Play\/Pause is on the bottom. On the top is a power button\/pairing control, which also controls hands-free calling functions.The Bluetooth connection was stable for line-of-sight distances up to at least 30 feet. Inside the house with a couple of walls between my Kindle Fire and the headphones, I noticed a few dropouts at around 25 feet or so.The headphone's internal battery can be charged from a USB port or an AC adapter. I used a Kindle AC charger, which worked just fine. The charging port is on the right earpiece and is covered with a silicone flap which appears to be water-resistant. A USB charging cable is included. The user guide does not give the specs on the headphone's battery, but it indicates that a fully charged battery will provide up to ten hours of listening time and over 250 hours of standby time for phone use.The headphones are very compact and weigh only 1.5 ounces. For carrying in a pocket or purse, they don't take up much more space than earphones, and they're a lot more comfortable than earphones that plug into your ears. After listening to music for an hour or so, I came to like the headphones. With their excellent audio quality, portability, and Bluetooth connection, they're a good choice for anyone looking for a set of wireless headphones.A product sample was provided for review purposes.","rating":5},{"comment":"Other reviewers have waxed enthusiastic about the sound. To be sure these do sound great for what they are, but I want to level set expectations: if you tend to be a critical listener these may fall short. If you have to be surrounded by music most of your waking hours for pleasure you will love these.What earned the review sample that I received a solid five stars is they are ultra comfortable and they stay in place when I am on my daily walks and short jogs. There is a safty factor too: they do not totally block ambient noise, so I can hear approaching cars behind me when I am on a walk. The isolating in-ear monitors that I normally use so completely blocked out everything that I was in my own world on walks and drifted into a few unsafe situations.The sound quality is such that you can easily hear high, mid and low range frequencies in most music. I listen to acoustic jazz circa 1950s and these do an excellent job for that style.An interesting observation is during my testing I paired and connected with these, put them through their paces and then paired and connected to another bluetooth device that I was checking out. These remained connected after I established a connection to the other device and I was able to stream music to both simultaneously. That leads me to conclude that two people could listen to the same music stream if each had a pair of these phones. That impressed me.Bottom line: these phones are everything the previous reviewers said and are perfect for sports or other active endeavors because they do stay put. Plus they easily fit in a shirt pocket.","rating":5},{"comment":"Update: A month after I wrote this review, the headphones simply stopped working in the middle of a workout. They have remained non-functional since, so I'm lowering the review rating accordingly. The original review is below.The Swage Sport Bluetooth Headphones are an interesting change from the headphones I'm used to. I've used several sets of headphones that fit on the ears and have a connector that goes behind the head. However, I've got a somewhat larger head than average and, so far, I've found that they always pinch and get uncomfortable after 20 minutes. The flexible connector that Swage employs didn't exhibit that problem. I was able to wear the headphones for over an hour with no discomfort.Connectivity:I had no problem pairing the headphones with my phone (a Galaxy SIII), several Kindle Fire tablets, and my laptop. I didn't formally test the range but with a clear line of sight, I think I got as far away as 30' and still had connectivity. Inside, around corners and through walls and such, the range was much more constrained, perhaps half that. If your music source is in the kitchen and you're in the back bedroom, as I was, you're likely to lose the signal. That's pretty typical, though, and is just a limitation of the Bluetooth technology, not a slam on these headphones.Convenience:These headphones curl up very small and they easily fit in a pocket. The controls are logical and it took only a brief review of the manual to figure out how to use everything. All of the controls are on the right earpiece and you can control the volume, turn on\/off, pair, pause\/play, forward and reverse from the various controls. The headphones charge with a standard micro-USB cable (not provided).Activity:Since the headphones include the word \"Sport\" in the name, I tested them while working out and while jogging to work. For some things, these were great. I paired them with a Kindle Fire HDX and used them while working out on an elliptical. I've always wanted to do that but have been horribly afraid of using traditional corded headphones. These were ideal and I was able to use them with confidence. I used them with my phone and listened to music and the radio while lifting. And I used them with my phone while jogging.The first use was great; the latter two were more problematic. Because these headphones don't pinch as tightly, they also don't stay on as well. For jogging, in particularly, I constantly had to adjust them. The same thing with weightlifting when I was on the bench. For biking or the elliptical or gentler sport use, these are great. For the other uses, you should probably try something else. For outdoor use, these don't offer the sound-dampening qualities of good in-ear or over-the-ear headphones, so you should keep that in mind if you're using these outside a lot.Sound quality:I tested the sound quality with the following:1. A superb female vocal quartet (ripped at very high quality) to test the high range and to test the clarity and crispness of the sound.2. A variety of brass-heavy classical music to test power, mid-range, and bass.3. A pristine piano concerto to test the full range.Some notes:- For the high end, in particular, the sound was very good, with crystal-clear quality.- To my ears, these headphones sounded overly bright, lacking some of the depth that I've heard in a few other alternatives.- I listened to a John Williams March\/Fanfare at full volume and heard no distortion or crackling, which would often happen with cheaper headphones.- When paired with my phone, the headphones didn't have quite as much punch as my primary corded headphones. When I was listening outside on a busy street waiting for a bus, a couple of times the headphone sound was overwhelmed, even at max volume. This wasn't a real problem, for the most part but I did notice it.Durability:It's too soon to say. I'm most nervous about the flexible bit of silicone that covers the charging port. It's awkward to remove that to charge the headphones and I can easily see breaking that off. The earpieces and buttons otherwise seem well-built. As for the connecting cable, I have no idea, since I've never owned a set of headphones with this kind of connector. So far, so good, after a week of heavy use.Mic:I didn't test the mic much as I was mostly using this with a tablet rather than with a phone. I used the mic with the Samsung equivalent of Siri, asking it to find the nearest restaurant and the like. It had no problem understanding me and I didn't have any trouble with these basic tests. I also phoned some friends and the verdict was that the sound was muffled but understandable, even when I was in the laundry room next to my operating washer and dryer, or outside with some suburb street noise. Still, if you expect to be doing a lot of talking, these probably aren't the headphones for you. I compared the mic with a set of wired headphones with a mic and everyone said that these were clearly the loser. The mic is fair, at best.The headphones are a bit pricy for the genre, at $49.99 at the time I'm writing this. Given this and the limitations noted above (the overly-bright sound, slipping off the ear during exercise, the muffled mic), I'd give these roughly 3.5 stars. I'm rounding up since Amazon doesn't allow the half star.Disclaimer: the manufacturer provided a sample for review purposes with no restrictions on the review outcome. I have no personal or financial interest in the company or in anyone employed there.","rating":1},{"comment":"What a nice little set of headphones. It curls up in a little spiral and uses that tension to stay on my head.Pairing was easy and reconnecting is instant. I like listening to it as I'm walking my dog every morning. It works well for walking, but I think it would slip off with anything more active.The sound is good, and phone calls are clear enough if I need to use it that way. I hear a slight echo from the headphones and when I test the other end, the voice is slightly muffled. My daughter has more trouble with it than I do. When I talk to her while wearing the headphones, she is keeps asking me to repeat myself.Bluetooth range is very good. Like my other good Bluetooth headphones and speakers, I can leave the room, go down the hallway around a bend into the kitchen and still get reception.Controls are easy to reach and intuitive. They're comfortable to wear and curl up compact for storage. There's not much to complain about. I'm very happy with them.This product was provided for review by Rokit Boost.","rating":4},{"comment":"The sound on these Swage Sport Bluetooth headphones is excellent, especially considering the size. I usually listen to music but the first time I tried these was with a movie on my Kindle HD. The Bluetooth pairing was simple and connected right away. (They later also paired easily with my iTouch, iPhone and iPad.) All of the music and sound effects in the movie were loud and clear with good bass and good separation. The voices were crisp and clear. I never thought about testing headphones with a movie before but it really showcased the capabilities.Next I listened to Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2, one of my favorites. I like to test headphones with classical music because of the variety of sounds from all of the instruments and the complexity of the music. The sound was beautiful with these headphones. Each note was clear from the high notes to the bass. I was impressed. Next, I listened to some Aerosmith and then to the Beatles Love album. Those sounded equally good. And the nice thing is that these are so compact that I could put them in a big pocket. They fold up. They're also very light so I hardly noticed I was wearing them after a few minutes.I received these Swage Sport Bluetooth headphones in the red color for testing and review.","rating":5},{"comment":"I LOVE how small and light these are. They curl up and easily fit in your pocket. That's about it for the good points.I'm not an audio expert and I don't care for much bass. These are downright tinny sounding. However, I'm willing to overlook that because they're wireless.They will not stay on my left ear for more than a minute while walking. Never had this issue with my other neckband headphones.Here's the worst part:Walking in the woods... ( I was not running, jogging, or sweating. It was 75, dry and clear)1)Fully charged iPhone 5s and Swage headphones.1)Nothing on me but a drivers license, car and house key, five dollars, my phone, and headphones.2)Phone in left front or back shorts pocket: Get sound about 3 out of every 10 seconds.3)Phone in right front shorts pocket: Breaks up every step.4)Phone in right back pocket: sound is consistent.... until I turn my head about 20 to the left or look down... sound cuts out.If you always look straight ahead or to the right, you'll hear sound. This is unacceptable for ANY headphone, IMO. I have a pair of SoundBot BT headphones that do not suffer from any of these problems... but they're heavier, bulkier, and look goofy used outdoors.If you wear your phone on a strap on your right bicep you should be fine. It shouldn't be a requirement to use these outside.","rating":2},{"comment":"This product worked great in a gym. I love wearing bluetooth headphones in gym as they don't get in the way of your workout. The thing that impressed me with this headphone was lightweight and also it did not generate heat. Paired nicely with Samsung Galaxy phones (S4 and Note3) as well as Tab series. Liked it overall. Sample provided.","rating":5},{"comment":"I received this in a matte red finish at no cost in exchange for writing a review. Here are my comments.1. The first unit I received was defective--it wouldn't hold a charge. I emailed the company and received a replacement unit within 3 business days that works fine.2. These are very compact--a 3 inch diameter circle when folded--and lightweight. Unlike other sports bluetooth headsets, these have no separate ear buds. Instead they use an over the ear design, so no worries about deciding which ear bud size is right or having ear buds come loose.But that over the ear design makes wearing these the same as wearing a pair of ear muffs, which don't breathe. I took these on a 7 mile run that started in warm, bright sunshine. After a few miles I had to take them off and give my ears some air to cool off. Even when I ran in a cooler and shadier spot, my ears still were very warm. So for me these will gather dust during the Spring and Summer.However, these did stay securely in place during some very vigorous running, so no worries along those lines.3. These come with a micro USB cable for charging, but no carrying case, which surprised me because they cost more than comparable bluetooth sport headsets.4. The controls are all located on the Right earpiece, and are larger and a bit easier to use than on other bluetooth headsets. The telephone icon button turns this on and off, is used for answering phone calls, and also for initial pairing. Just hold it down for about 7 seconds until you see a flashing red\/blue light, and then pair your device. My iPhone 4S paired effortlessly.There is a red charging light to indicate charging is in progress, and will turn blue when this is fully charged. In addition, a battery icon appears on my iPhone 4S to show how much of a charge this has left. Very convenient.5. The sound is very good and comparable to other bluetooth sports headsets. Voices are clear, the treble isn't tinny, and the bass isn't muddy, though of course not as deep as on more expensive headsets.They are easy to take on and off, and comfortable to wear except for making my ears too warm. The matte red finish is also attractive and something I won't hesitate to wear to the gym.Bottom line: While these are nice, I can't use them for running for half the year (Spring and Summer) because the over the ear design makes my ears uncomfortably warm when running in warm weather. However, if you're not a runner, that is not an issue. I also think at 49.99 these are a bit expensive compared to comparable headphones.","rating":4},{"comment":"I received a 'for review' unit from Sabrent but I did not promise or hinted that a 'good review' was forthcoming. However, I found no fault whatsoever to this adapter.If you need a wired network connection and your computer lacks an Ethernet port but has a USB port, this does the job perfectly. On my Windows 7 it was a quick install and it did not interfere with my Wi-Fi or my other Ethernet port. According to the specs, you get 10\/100 Mbit\/s 10BasteT\/10BAseTx both full duplex and half duplex. Gigabit Ethernet, of course, is only possible over USB 3.0 because USB 2.0 is limited to about 480 Mbit\/s so it's not supported by this specific model.It's an easy 5-stars because I am unaware of any defects.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a rugged but portable adapter and provides a solution for travelers who use ultra slim notebooks without an Ethernet jack, and at times find that where they are staying does not have Wi-Fi internet available.

System requirements as stated on the package are: Pentium III 800 Hz or faster PC with USB port, 256 MB RAM or more, and Windows or Mac operating system.  This would not work with a tablet.I tested the connection speed through this, and the speeds I got were only slightly slower than I get when I'm plugged directly into my network using the built in Ethernet connection on my computer.

I just plugged it in and it worked. This is great because I have no Ethernet port on the MacBook Air.It's great to take a load off the wireless spectrum when you can. You'll likely get a faster connection and less interference. A device like this can also come in very handy when traveling if the WiFi is not accessible or is very slow and an Ethernet option is available.It is however only USB 2.0 and Fast Ethernet instead of gigabit. Gigabit adapters like this are available, and I would get one of those if you really need the speed and can take advantage of it, but for many cases Fast Ethernet will be more than enough. One minor quibble is that it only has one red LED light to indicate power so I wish it also had a data light that flickered during data transfer. Given the price I don't find this a big enough issue to deduct any stars.This device is also relatively inexpensive. If you travel a lot and depend on your computer and have a USB port but no Ethernet port on your computer, then I would highly recommend bringing one of these along with you when you travel (preferably with an Ethernet cable as well).NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"This product is definitely a 5 star. one, the price is just amazing. only $12 for this! second, this product is VERY handy. on some new tablet\/laptops, don't have a wifi adapter.

Slim notebook computers certainly don't have RJ45 jacks and they seem to be absent from many devices. Perhaps the manufacturers think wireless is good enough.But in some hotels and business venues, wired access is all there is. Or you might want a wired connection for added security or especially reliability or speed. In such a case, you plug this adapter into a USB port, plug in the Ethernet cable, and you're good to go. Just about any modern operating system will recognize the connection without the need for additional drivers.The adapter is capable of use on 100mbit LANs, and that's within the capability of a USB 2.0 port. Of course, many internet connections deliver much less and that will usually be the limiting speed factor.The adapter seems well made. It's lightweight and highly portable, though perhaps slightly larger than some others that I've used.

Simply take it out of the package, plug it in. Wait a short time for the drivers to load. Plug the network cable into the USB NIC and you should be ready to go.One thing to be aware of - the Amazon listing and images have OSX support listed. The problem is, the system requirements on the package clearly state that they only offer Windows support (XP, Vista, Win 7 and Win 8 (and I've verified it works fine with 8.1 and 8.1 Update). I do not have easy access to an OSX machine, so I can't verify if the packages is correct or if the Amazon listing is. If I can get hands on an OSX machine, I will update my review.In terms of performance, this is &#34;only&#34; a 10\/100 NIC. You do NOT get gigabit support with this. Performance at 100 mbit is comparable to the 100 mbit performance from my Windows 7 work laptop connected to a 100 mbit port. If you have a ton of USB devices plugged in, you might notice a performance issue, but with just web browsing, music streaming, etc, this is fine. Large file copy performance seems about the same as well, but I did NOT do robust testing to compare.The NIC is light weight and travel sized. I will carry it with me when I travel and I have my Surface Pro with me. Sometimes wireless just isn't available, and in those instances this will be a life saver.The speed is adequate for travel.

The on\/off switch on a USB hub may seem odd or unneeded but I actually have good uses for it because my keyboard won't be recognized when I drop my laptop into the docking station unless I do a power recycle so, rather than plug\/unplug a cable to turn off the power for 'everything' I simply switch the hub on\/off and it's more convenient. This can also be handy if you are using more than one input device such as mice and keyboards or you want to explicitly shut off access to certain peripherals.Based on my testing, the hub appears to be reliable and well made.

And to make it even a little better, you can now keep those ports connected and STILL have the ability to turn them on or off. That&#8217;s the beauty of this thing.When you cook up this Sabrent device, you can then hook up up to four devices, choosing when you want to run them. For instance, should you want to charge your phone, your iPad, your Kindle, your Nook (apparently you can&#8217;t make up mind about e-readers) or whatever, you just hook them up. Should one of them beep or click or bing because they&#8217;re done, all you have to do is tap the button next to its wire and voila! The power to it is cut off.Should you worry that you might wonder which of them you&#8217;ve tapped on, and which is tapped off, just look for the blue light next to the wire: if it&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s on.

It&#8217;s fully plug and play (tested on Win 7 and XP machines). The hub itself is very compact, measuring only about 3.5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide. All four ports are on the long edge of the hub.A nice feature, and a feature not usually found in a hub, is on\/off switches for each port. Each switch works independently, so you can turn on (or off) just the ports you want to use. That&#8217;s handy for when I&#8217;m using the hub as a charge port and want to turn off the power without having to disconnect the device. The switches each have a light to indicate if it is powered on. The switch itself is rather light-duty feeling, but so far none have failed to work.The cord that plugs into the PC is short (less than a foot end-to-end) but is stout and has well-anchored connectors. The short length makes it more suitable to something such as a laptop (easy to carry along) rather than a floor-mounted PC.Zero problems with usage or functionality. Keep in mind this is a passive hub (it draws its power from the PC rather than a separate power supply) so it&#8217;s not well-suited to power-hungry attachments, such as large external drives. It works great for thumb drives, printers, and other such devices.Works as it should and the separate power buttons for each port is a great feature.

Matter of fact, I'm closing in onto reviewing all of their USB hubs such as the 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub (HB-UM43) that's selling on Amazon US for about $15 ($14.99) plus shipping and special thanks to Sabrent for once again sending this out to review.Also See: Sabrent 4 Port Aluminum  USB 3.0 Hub (HB-MCS4)The dream of the operation is that I move from these computer accessories to bigger and better products from Sabrent but until then let's continue on with this review. Shall we? Well, the packaging of this product was stupid simply and didn't include much inside beside the USB hub.As soon as possible, I plugged it into my laptop and off I went with connecting other accessories to it, such as my Samsung Galaxy S4, Nokia Lumia 810, Apple iPod touch 4th Generation, Samsung Camcorder, and more. They all connected correctly with no issues and I was able to control them individually with the built-in switches on the top.Every USB port is USB 3.0 so transferring files from one to another and sadly but surely I wasn't able to take advantage of this feature. I will continue to test it as time moves on and report back with any updates.The build quality is not that great at all since a large majority of it is plastic and the cable is durable so that's a plus there cause the design\/color scheme isn't that creative, colorful, or attractive.In conclusion, Sabrent did a pretty good job with this USB hub but there's a couple of flaws that I would like them to address when they're releasing an updated version of this exact model or better yet a new model period.","rating":4},{"comment":"This multiport USB 3.0 hub allows you to connect up to 4 devices to the hub and switch them on or off via buttons on the hub. If you have 3 or 4 devices plugged in which use a lot of power you could run into power disruption issues, so I'd be careful about using multiple external hard drives with this. This item is nice if you don't want to keep plugging and unplugging USB devices, it has LED indicators for each port and it is a fairly compact device. The hub comes in one of those plastic shell retail packages that you have to cut to get the contents out. Overall I would say this is a useful item that will work well for most users.","rating":4},{"comment":"Definitely a strong item from Sabrent and I absolutely love the brand and quality.With that said, I feel as though this product fell short of their awesome name.Here are my major complaints:- The USB portion of the cable is too short. A little bit longer and this would have been ideal- The switches feel fairly cheap and as an avid button smasher, I feel the buttons are too fragile.- Connection was spotty at times but great at other times. Inconsistency may be the issue.Here are some major pluses:+ Sleek design+ Affordable+ Easy to useNot the best Sabrent product I've received but definitely still quality. I hope that this review will help Sabrent continue the awesome quality of their products!3\/5 Stars ***","rating":3},{"comment":"This is a 4 port 3.0 hub. It's nice because it's small and compact. It fits in the backpack or laptop case without any problems. The 3.0 port means you can get fast transfers and it's also backwards compatible to the 2.0 and below. Furthermore it's got individual on\/off switches for each port. Overall, just an excellent way to expand 1 port into 4. Highly recommended. Sample was provided for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is just what I needed to expand my usb ports. It works well and have not had any issues with it. I like that it has on\/off buttons to activate each port and it doesn't need a power cord. I wouldn't want to run to many powered devices off one usb port from my computer, could lead to possible overheating problems. I just needed extra ports for thumb drives, tired of getting up from my desk and moving my Lenovo All-In-One trying to access my ports on the side.

TheSabrent 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub with Individual Power Switchesis a must have for the gadget obsessed.Designed in solid black with blue indication lights, this hub is perfect to go anywhere.  For use in the office or on the road, this hub is both compact and powerful.  After plugging the unit in, I had a brief driver installation from Windows that took a couple seconds but didn't require me to do a thing.  Afterwards, I tested the hub with a few USB flash drives and a portable hard drive.  The read\/write speeds were comparable to plugging the respective device directly into the USB 3.0 port on the computer.  An awesome feature of this hub is that it is backwards compatible with USB 2.0 allowing for greater support of older devices.  Each port features an on\/off switch which is a really great feature for when you want to leave the hub and certain devices plugged into the computer, but don't necessarily need to use other devices currently connected to it; truly an ingenious design.All things considered, I find this hub useful, fully functional, and a great investment for adding additional USB 3.0 ports to any computer.  The hub delivers the performance expected and it's cool to see the added feature of individual on\/off switches.  The Sabrent 4 Port USB 3.0 Hub allows you to connect more at once allowing for limitless possibilities.[Sample Provided For Review]","rating":5},{"comment":"Works great with my new lap top that has a 3.0 port.  Hooked numerous devices to it with no trouble.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Sabrent 4-Port USB 3.0 Hub is compact at under 3 1\/2 inches long and can be tucked in a bag to use when travelling.It has four ports each with a switch and LED indicator, which is a very useful feature most hubs don&#8217;t have.No software is needed, just plug it in and it is ready to go.USB 3.0 transfers data at up to 5 Gbps.  In practice, I have never seen those speeds, but it is nice to know that the hub isn&#8217;t the bottleneck.  It is backwards-compatible with USB 2.0 and 1.0.The hub will provide up to 900 mA of power total to the four ports although some peripherals may require more power than that and the hub is not intended to be used as a charging station.The 9 in. cable is ideal for use with my Mac mini.  It puts four ports with switches right on top where they are needed.  I use a Logitech wireless keyboard and have not had any problems with it or with a Logitech wireless mouse when tested while the hub is in use.Sabrent provided a sample for evaluation and review.","rating":5},{"comment":"I received a review sample of the USB 3.0 version of this hub and tested it to ensure that all four ports were capable of USB 3.0. They are. Even my Samsung Galaxy Note 3, which seems to hate hubs worked perfectly with it and transferred at full 3.0 speeds.The switches are an enigma - they look cool, but I am not sure they serve a valid purpose. The lights surrounding them, though, do because they show at a glance which ports are turned on.This hub will also support older USB 2.0 and 1.1 devices, so you can mix and match. I tested a few legacy devices that I had laying around and they also work perfectly.Among the reasons why I rated this at five stars is it's well constructed. Apparently Sabrent has done some re-engineering since their earlier models because some of the complaints that I read in earlier reviews are not valid for the hub I received. For one thing the length of the pigtail that connects to your computer's USB port is nearly ten inches long (including the connector itself). The switches feel solid under my fingers, and since mine is a review sample I purposely tried to break them. They didn't. The cable itself is heavy duty with strain reliefs and appears like it was built to last.Overall, this hub performed per claimed specs and is well built. If you need to connect four USB 3.0 devices to your computer this one merits serious consideration.","rating":5},{"comment":"I love the concept of plugging in all my USB gadgets at once, and just switch over to the one I need ..Less Ware and Tear on the USB port on the computer, that's a PLUS right there...My USB ports are on the back, and this little guy has a 9\" wire to set the switch box out front.Easy to get to and plug in.

Thank you for getting it to me on the day promised.","rating":5},{"comment":"This thing damaged my 2 external drives. The ports sometimes works, sometimes don't. Some drives get recognized, but not always, and the time it take to access the files is preposterous.Either this is a very cheaply made product, or the quality control is non existent (or both).Do not buy it.","rating":1},{"comment":"Disclosure: I received a sample from the manufacturer for review, but I write unbiased reviews and will not risk my reputation as a reviewer for the sake of a free sample.This is a nice, lightweight USB 3.0 hub that is highly portable and adds negligible weight and volume to the contents of a briefcase or the like. Nevertheless, I use it in a fixed position, as I'll describe.It's a fairly typical design: four ports on one side, meaning that all cables and devices enter from the same direction, which I feel is an advantage and makes the device easier to work with. The ports are, however, pretty much flat to the surface on which the hub rests, and the hub tends to lift if fully loaded with cables. Dongle type devices don't present an issue.The lead that goes to your computer is about 9 inches long. It might have been a little longer but will present no issue when used with a laptop or tablet. There's more of an issue with a desktop computer unless there are easily accessible USB ports in the front. Most modern computers provide this in some manner.The interesting feature is the switches. There are four small mechanical switches on the top, one for each port. Since these switches are mechanical, they hold their position, on or off, between computer power-ups. That's important, because the idea is that you can turn USB devices on or off my means of the switches. There is no need to unplug a device to turn it off. This is amazingly convenient. A blue light clearly indicates the switch position.For instance, I have a USB headset that I sometimes don't want &#34;present&#34; to my computer. Instead of messing around with unplugging it and then plugging back in later when I want to use it, I just push the switch. The same is true with a wireless dongle and a bluetooth dongle.Be careful, though, not to shut down a storage device using the switch. If the device is active at the time or waiting to write cached data, you could suffer a data loss.The idea of leaving devices plugged in, though, isn't wholly compatible with portable use. That's why I use this in a fixed position with my desktop computer.I don't yet have information as to long term reliability, especially of the switches. The device looks about average in build, meaning that if you take care of it, it will last. In fixed position usage it won't be subject to the rigors of travel.I recommend this as a clever and useful option. It wouldn't be my choice for travel, but I'm using it daily with my desktop computer.","rating":4},{"comment":"I was asked to provide an honest review for the Sabrent hub.  Nothing was promised.  I am so glad I agreed to review.  This hub fits all my gadget needs, fits easily into my laptop bag when traveling, has enough hugs for unlimited options.  I tested this hub plugged into three different desktops and laptops and while connected, charged samsung android phones, tablets, kindle, used the usb dongle for my keyboard, mouse, used thumb drives, and pretty much did everything I could think of to it.  The hub never had any power issues, or loss of power no matter how I abused it.  What was the most appreciated was that I could use the power switches to turn the ports on or off without having to unplug the item.  And the LED light made it so easy to see what was powered or not, or in low light made it easier to find the port (another huge plus for me).  Several of my friends saw it being tested and tried to convince me to &#34;loan&#34; it to them - it really is different enough to catch their attention.  I have yet to find anything but positive to say about this product.  My daughter did convince me to loan it - temporarily - and has fallen for it as well.  She could not find anything she did not like about it, agreed with everything I told her about it, and I'm afraid I might not see it anytime soon.  :) If you find you need additional USB power ports beyond what's on your laptop or desktop - this is a product you want to get.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is the cutest little hub.  It is solid black with blue ports and blue power light indicators. There is a power button for each port. It helps if you have devices that you like to use on a regular basis but not all the time. I powered a USB fan and a USB pencil sharpener. I also like to use these for transferring pictures from one stick to another. It is small enough to take with you and would be perfect for a laptop. I was able to transfer data through it at a good speed and no problems at all. It also worked well with my MacBook Pro. I received this product for a fair and honest review.","rating":5},{"comment":"If you are looking for a nicely designed USB hub to add 4 USB 3 ports to your laptop, tablet or other USB 3 capable device, the Sabrent with power switches is pretty nice for the money.Right now I am charging my Lumia 1020, my iPhone 5s and a FiiO headphone amp. I also have a USB thumb drive plugged in to copy files around to test. So far, it's working as I expect it to.Each of the 4 ports on the hub has a button that allows you to power a port, or not. If the switch is up, that port is not active at all. This is nice if you need this level of control over your USB hubs.The hub is also fairly light weight and will become my Surface Pro travel companion based on the size and weight.I have not tried a USB hard drive with this, but the thumb drive I've got plugged in seems to be giving me almost the same performance as it gives when the drive is plugged directly into my laptop.Overall, this is a nice hub with some unique capability and is light weight.Recommended.I received a free sample for review purposes from the manufacturer.","rating":5},{"comment":"After a bit of trial and error got it working on my devices.  Have a cf card reader that was a bit finicky leaving it connected so a card during reboots.  Anyway just unplug it until I really need to use it.  The device then connects immediately.  Other device, mouse, worked fine and so issue.Much heavier duty than a pos hub I tried previously.","rating":5},{"comment":"Although two USB hubs are already connected to my laptop, I still somehow manage to run short of USB ports.  So when Sabrent asked me to review their HB-UM43, four port USB 3.0 hub, I gladly agreed.  For what I use it for, this hub does a great job, as the ability to individually control power to each of the ports, is something that I find to be very convenient.I have a number of USB powered devices that don&#8217;t really require connectivity or power all the time.  These include speakers, Bluetooth adapters, power banks, USB fan, and flash and external drives.  Though the savings in energy may be small, this hub provides a way to deliver power or provide connectivity, only at those times when I really need it.The switches probably are not heavy duty, and appear to have thin springs that could fail over time, but as I intend to go easy on them, hopefully the switches will hold up for an extended period.  The blue light that comes on when a port is switched &#8220;on&#8221;, is also quite useful, and the 9&#8221; connecting cord provides some flexibility for setting up.Sabrent&#8217;s products are usually not at the low end of the price range, and that&#8217;s also the case with the HB-UM43.  Sabrent&#8217;sHB-UMLSis a less costly option, however it is only a USB 2.0 device.  I do find the ability to control power very handy, and recommend either of these models to those seeking that particular functionality.  With over 1200 reviews, it&#8217;s pretty clear that most users are very satisfied with the HB-UM43.","rating":4},{"comment":"I recommend this product.  I use multiple external units and this 4 port hub works fine.","rating":5},{"comment":"At first sight, this bag is large and beautiful! This is my first messenger type camera bag and I've had plenty of camera bags, multiple backpack types and stroller types. I have never been a fan of having to haul the bag over a single shoulder because I usually have hands full and don't want to deal with having to balance the bag on my shoulder. But so far, this bag sits nicely on my shoulders, but with my full equipment load, I can see how this can put a strain on my shoulder after several hours.Here's my breakdown:Positives:- Beautiful heavy duty bag.- Large with plenty of compartments and zippered pockets.- Separate camera container - easily removable when camera is not needed.- I can fit my Canon 5Diii, 24-70mm, 70-200mm, flash, some accessories and they all fit! (but heavy)Negatives:- Bag is a bit on the heavy side.- The shoulder strap is odd, the padding is not on the entire strap, making it a dedicated a right shoulder with the bag left hip carry.- The separable camera storage area is nice, but when using an extra battery grip, the velcro liners doesn't stay on, but the zipper still closes fine (See picture).- Need to travel light! The weight will add up quick, which is not good for long travel that will require you to bring more equipment as the weight will be taxing on your shoulder.I am very happy with the flexibility of this camera bag, this would be a good everyday carry with lighter equipment (i.e. Camera, Lens, and Flash), but if you need to carry more equipment, you should consider getting a backpack type camera bag.","rating":4},{"comment":"The TCDM-101 oozes quality from the moment you unwrap it. Materials, design, workmanship, everything is top-notch.The bag consists of two parts: a ballistic nylon messenger bag with built-in padded compartments for laptop and tablet(s), and a photo equipment insert.The top of the bag features a zipper which allows quick access to the inside without undoing the flap snaps. The photo compartment can hold a fairly wide combination of bodies, lenses and flash. I have uploaded a few pictures to try and illustrate the layout of this incredible bag.The TCDM-101 weighs just under 4 lbs -- useful to know if you use it as your carry-on as some airlines are fond of enforcing weight restrictions.The only thing I'm confused about with this bag is the shoulder strap. There is very elaborate shoulder padding, but it is attached to one side of the strap and only one size can be adjusted, so unless you keep the strap at its shortest, the shoulder pad ends up in your back, not on top of your shoulder where it belongs. Other than that, the bag is amazing, and can carry a considerable amount of equipment safely even in demanding weather conditions. I particularly like the computer and tablet compartments. An expensive bag, but well worth it for its capacity, protection and craftsmanship. Recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"I am in LOVE with the Thule messenger bag!  I can finally carry my Canon DSLR with the 18-135 lens and several extra batteries, my files, a 10&#34; tablet, a 7&#34; kindle, charging cords AND so much more - including my 15.6 laptop when needed.  All in one place with convenient access.  I absolutely appreciate this bag, it's become my everyday bag so I have everything needed with me, at all times.","rating":5},{"comment":"Everything about the Thule Covert DSLR Messenger camera Case says this is for serious professional photographers.  Just a casual glance at the bag will reveal that it is well designed to meet the needs of a professional photographer.The bag is designed with some unusual features using the highest quality materials.  It is not small - measuring some 21  \" X 11\" X 8 1\/3\" on the exterior and has interior measurements of 17.7\" X 9\/8\" X 5 \".  This is ample room for your DSLR camera, a 15\" laptop and all your camera equipment.When you open the bag, the first thing you will notice is the handy storage compartment.  There are some amazing features about the storage compartment. First, the entire compartment can be removed from the case.  It is zippered, so nothing will spill out.  It has a nice carrying handle on top for ease in carrying.  Open the storage compartment and you will see a series of six dividers.  These are hard plastic dividers held in place by Velcro - so they are adjustable or you can remove one or more if you wanted to. The dividers vary in height, two tall, two mid height and two short ones. You can adjust the dividers to make sure all the equipment fits securely in the compartment.  The compartment is well padded to protect your camera and any other equipment you choose to store inside it.  On the front of the removable compartment are two mesh storage slots for small equipment - like cables, etc.On the back wall of the case is storage slot for a laptop.  It is large enough to accommodate most 15  laptops.  It front of the laptop storage are two pouches that can hold additional equipment such as power cords and other miscellaneous equipment.On the front of the case is another zippered compartment and in front of that are two pouches with Velcro flaps to secure them.  There is a large flap that covers the front of the Covert case.  The top part of the flap has a zippered compartment with lots of storage space for cables, chargers, etc.The front flap snaps shut with straps and mechanical snaps.You can access the case by a zipper opening on the back - this would be for easy access to the laptop or some small item.  To get to the storage compartment, you will want to use the front to access it.There is a convenient carrying handle on the top of the case, a shoulder strap and a cross body strap.Thule enjoys a reputation for highest quality in craftsmanship and design.  This is an excellent example of why they have such a good reputation.  This case is relatively expensive but it is designed to carry all your equipment with ease and safety.Well designed, well made.  It will be an excellent case for the serious photographer.","rating":5},{"comment":"I wish I could upload a photo to show the removable camera portion, but since Amazon seems to have disabled this, I will try to describe it as best as possible.  I did notice if you click on the images then one shows up of the insert, it is the second to last image.The camera storage is an oblong  top zippered , padded separate storage unit.  It is roughly  17 inches long by  6 inches wide across the top by  10 inches deep.  Inside are six fairly stiff teal colored dividers with Velcro along the sides so that you may adjust the spacing within.  Two are tall, two medium and two short.  These are excellent for separating your DSLR from lenses and flash.  It has two stretchy mesh pockets on the front for smaller less breakable objects.  The top has a sewn on handle, so you can carry it by itself.This fits into the front of the main messenger bag.  Inside the messenger back is a divider which is 17 inches wide for you to insert a laptop. The divider itself has two full height lightly padded pockets for smaller tablets or thin objects.The bag has a hidden zipper under the top so that you can access the contents with the flap still snapped shut.The front has a 14 inch long zipper opening by  about 8 inches deep.  Inside that pocket are two  pockets sewn to the back and  a clip on a short piece of ribbon.  The front of that zippered pocket has two Velcro closure pockets  each about 9 inches deep and 6 inches wide at the bottom (they narrow as they go down).The flap itself is also a pocket, but with just one strip of Velcro to close it.  It also has another large zippered pocket ON it which  is 17 inch zipper by about 9 inch deep  pocket.The bag is 21 inches at the top, tapering to about 17 inches at the bottom and is 6 inches wide in the middle.  The buckle portion has some excess play in it along the bottom so that you can attach your tripod to the outside (at least that is what I have been using it for).  There is also another strap which runs across the back with a clip and snap buckle.  You can use this to fasten it as an X across your body with opposite to the larger cross body strap.  As a women, I found that pretty awkward, since I basically then looked like I was wearing a very strange bra.  It is fine on a man.  And the cross strap alone (which is very padded) was also fine on a woman.  The cross strap can be unfastened from the front via the large clip as well.This is made of quality materials, feels solid, all the zippers function smoothly.I like that I can remove the whole lens\/camera setup if I know I will not need it for the day and simply put it back in when I need it.  I have also used the lens\/camera bag in another bag when I needed more space.I really like that it does not look like a camera bag.  Nobody is going to know you are carrying thousands of dollars of camera gear just by looking at it.A few warnings:This one is for us gals,  if you are reasonably  endowed it takes a little fiddling to get the cross strap on correctly.  I find that I mostly just shorten it up and carry it like a regular purse.This bag is BIG, if you take it on a plane it is going to count as your carry on, not your personal item.For serious hiking or walking, I prefer a backpack, as it is more comfy.  However, to get the camera out with a backpack you have to remove it, this bag makes it easy to get the camera without taking it off.I am not sure why they advertise it as for the young, in the know professional. I am old, and probably out of the loop, but I still like this bag.","rating":5},{"comment":"I was intrigued by the unique design of this DSLR bag, and Thule is an excellent brand, so I ordered it for my Canon D40. I find it to to have strange design features, to offer excellent protection, and to be very well constructed, but a bit bulky to carry.The bag is really unusually designed. One side has a couple of clips that close a sort of top piece over a flap and zipper. The flap is designed for a phone, and the zipper reveals a compartment for small items like flash cards. This would seem to be the side that opens the internal bag - but it isn't! Instead, the entire top of the bag unzips from what would be the opposite side (the one that is next to the body when carried). It takes a little getting used to. There are two additional clips on each side; the four together make for a compression strap support system, which is more frequently seen on backpacks, and does provide more strength. The front straps are useful for clipping in a small tripod. Once you finally figure out how to open the zipper, the inside is revealed to be a bag-within-a-bag. There is a removable inner \"pod\", which I found very hard to remove and replace - but it does render good protection. The inside comes with four moveable dividers that are \"origami inspired\", which means that they have a lot of folds so they can be reshaped. I found that they do a good job of dividing the case, but the round shape makes them somewhat less useful. There is plenty of room for my Nikon camera with the extended lens, and the power pack to recharge the batteries. In the top flap one will find an additional zippered compartment for flash cards and small items. Finally, there is a large slot (between the \"pod\" and the outer shell), that can contain an IPad or Android pad up to about 10 inches. Both the inner \"pod\" and the outer shell feature a handle. There is just one shoulder strap for carrying the outer shell.The inner dimensions are 9.4 X 5.9 X 8.7 inches. External size is 12.2 X 13 X 6.3 (but it sure seems larger).There are several things I like: The construction is very sturdy, with good material and stitching, and it will provide excellent protection. The divider system is a bit clumsy, but works well enough. The adjustable shoulder strap is comfortable. The handle is good for carrying. The outer zipper pocket is large enough for keys and other loose items.But there are some drawbacks to the design. I could not find a way to make it simple to use; the bag is so bulky that I keep hitting it with my arm. I think that the size is just a bit too large - it needs to be a backpack at this size. The compression straps can be loosened to make the bag somewhat larger, but in practice that doesn't make much difference - the inner \"pod\" doesn't expand. The \"origami\" dividers have a lot of velcro, and I found it somewhat inconvenient to reshape them - it takes some effort. And last, that inner \"pod\" is too difficult to remove and reinstall - so I won't be using it separately.Summary: A bit bulky, but good protection. I consider this a \"niche\" bag, that some people will like, but many will not. Only moderately recommended if you have to carry a couple of lenses and cannot use a more convenient sized bag.","rating":3},{"comment":"Thule covert DSLR bag is supposed to fool people into not realizing there are cameras or camera equipment in the bag. I said, &#34;but it says Thule, in big letter on front.&#34; to which my family replied that thule does make other types of bags, but since they tend to be high end with high end products inside, it still says &#34;steal me!&#34;The bag is made of good quality material with nice cushioning, and thick shoulder straps with cushioning to make carrying easy and comfortable. It fits nicely over the shoulder and adjusts to fit various body types and frame sizes.However, The inner compartment comes out, but is so awkward and difficult to get out and put back in that it's not a positive feature. To get it out one must reach in under the outer lid and kind of pull back across the velcro, putting in is the reverse.There are two compartments in the inner bag that are adjustable and the inserts are rigid, which is a step above for me compared to other camera bags I have tried because it seems to hold the lens more securely.The accessory pouches are very flat but good for things like tablet, wallet, and phone.The size is large enough to hold a camera body, with attached lens, and probably two smaller lenses. It's easy to get in and out of to change the lens on the go. In the top there are three little memory card holders.Overall I give this bag a four, it has more pros than cons, really just the weird configuration to take the inner pouch out, so I wouldn't even bother.","rating":4},{"comment":"This Thule TCDS-101 case is supposed to be a covert over-the-shoulder small backpack that would disguise the fact that you're carrying an expensive DSLR.  So it may not look quite as much like a traditional camera bag, but in design it is a bit quirky.  For one thing, the top flap of the bag opens away from you. (I'll post a video soon to demonstrate this.)  The zippers can sometimes be a little stubborn, so if you need fast access to your camera for that incredible photo, you may miss the opportunity by the time you get your camera out of the bag.  Inside the main compartment there is room for your DSLR and lenses in an inner bag that can be removed.  Underneath the top flap there is a flat pocket for memory cards, film, etc. There is also a pocket for an iPad or 10.1 inch tablet.  Another quirky thing is that the front of the bag has two Travato side release buckles that make it look like the bag opens by unsnapping them and lifting the flap.  But in fact that flap just covers two pockets.  The exterior pocket looks like it is designed for a cell phone.  However the flap just comes down far enough to make it difficult to retrieve your cell phone without unsnapping the Travato buckles.  So you might miss a phone call.  Finally, it may be a small point, but the shoulder strap pad is down on one end of the shoulder strap where it attaches to the case and is designed to be centered after the strap is extended out like if you wanted to put the strap over your head.  If you just want to use the strap on your shoulder and not over your head, then the pad isn't easily moved up to your shoulder.  On the plus side, the bag is pretty weatherproof and has a 25 year quality guarantee.  One major downside is the price.","rating":4},{"comment":"The Thule Covert DSLR Satchel is a cool looking, albeit expensive, accessory for travelers and photographers.  If you take fragile equipment on your trips, you will find the removable compartment quite useful, since it is divided into three padded units and has an additional elasticized section on the outside.  If simplicity is what you desire, remove the inner portion and you are left with a compact and waterproof shoulder bag that has a padded handle, plus inner and outer compartments (two of which are zippered). The design makes it difficult for thieves to reach in and snatch your possessions. Be aware that the Covert Thule is not very large--the dimensions are 13 x 6.3 x 12.2 inches.  Additional uses for this bag are to hold your IPAD, phone, and other compact electronic devices.  This strong, lightweight, and uniquely deigned satchel has a twenty-five year warranty.","rating":4},{"comment":"There is nothing &#34;covert&#34; about this bag, as the name THULE is prominently displayed on the bag.  This is a large-size camera bag that can actually hold quite a bit (including an ipad), which is similar in size to a backpack.  I've always carried multiple camera bags when we traveled, so it was nice to have one bag that everything could fit in.  I even placed a breakable figurine inside to carry around until we made it back to the hotel.  It protected everything nicely.","rating":4},{"comment":"As shipped it appears great for a camera and  extra lenses. The iPad compartment is also a plus.  However it took me four attempts to remove the camera  section. One had to go on faith and hope you weren't ripping the bag. It uses a lot of Velcro to hold the camera compartment into the case,and the lens compartments into the camera compartment. I'm also not thrilled that the zipper opens from the back rather than the front of the case. The THULE name is prominently featured on the top of the bag which may diminish it's value as a &#34;covert&#34; case. It's not that big a &#34;satchel&#34;  if you plan to use it for something other than it's intended purpose. The brand has a great reputation but it's expensive.","rating":3},{"comment":"This is an amazing bag on so many levels.But first, a little about Thule. Skip this paragraph if you are already a Thule devotee. Born and still based in Sweden, Thule began by creating supplies for fishermen in the 1940s. They went on to make auto parts and carriers for, well, just about everything that can be attached to a car...surfboards, skis, bikes, kayaks, etc. They are the world's largest producer of roof boxes. Last year, this company that knows a thing or two about protecting expensive equipment (and children! They make jogging strollers as well!) started making camera bags.This padded bag has some terrific design features. Multiple compartments and cubby holes let you stuff not only camera, lenses, and cords, but also manuals or even your energy bar. The roomy main portion is actually a pull-out with 2 long lens (or tripod or whatever) compartments and a center for the camera itself. Not only does it not look like every other camera bag, it looks as if it opens on one side, but actually opens on the other, both traits foiling would-be thieves.Understated but ruggedly handsome and easy clean. The oversized shoulder strap lets you carry heavy gear with minimal strain.. This is all classic Thule construction. Build to take a beating, but beautifully designed.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is an incredible gear pack!Believe I counted ten easily accessible areas of storage, some multi compartmentalized.Zippers are quality and move without strain.Fabric is strong and attractive.Back of unit is padded well and straps are multi adjustable for a comfort enhanced carry experience.Your photographic equipment, I Pad, phone, personal effects, etc. will easily be accommodated. Also includes room for a change of clothing and then some.Packing options would fit a multitude of needs.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a great DSLR backpack. The compartments are well thought out and the construction is excellent. The waterproofing in materials and design is about as good as it gets.I'd give it a perfect score if it were just a bit lighter and a little less pricey, but overall it delivers about all you could want.","rating":4},{"comment":"If you're looking for a heavy-duty backpack that will allow you access to your camera while hiking or doing whatever, the TCDK-101 is about as good as you're going to find.  Built with plenty of storage space, it's designed for photographers but should also prove of value for others hauling electronics like a laptop or even those just looking for a strong, durable backpack.This pack is built to be durable, but is still relatively light (about two pounds) when empty.  The material is waterproof, and the flaps and zippers have been perfectly designed to prevent anything in the pack from becoming wet.  For photographers, there is a side zip pocket built to hold your camera as well as providing space for some spare lenses.  For those who might use this pack in other settings, it comfortably fits a laptop along with anything else you may need to pack.  For fun, I just tried to stuff in as many items as I could find laying around, and the capacity was impressive.  The straps on the outside are helpful for attaching a tripod or other device, and the space for a water bottle is helpful.Whether you're a photographer looking for a bag to carry all your equipment, an employee lugging a laptop and other items to work, or a hiker looking for a durable pack to carry, this is a great choice.  It's certainly not inexpensive, but this is a case where you're actually getting what you pay for.  Highly recommended, one of the best products I've seen all year.","rating":5},{"comment":"If you need a camera or gear pack that is full of features, this is a great choice.  This was a labor of love for whoever designed it, it is meticulously designed for function.  This pack has been designed with the person-on-the go in mind.  The roll-top flap and the flap in the middle of the front of the pack ensures that if you are working in the outdoors in the weather; rain or snow, that your gear will stay dry, unlike your regular backpack style front.  The material the pack is made out of is waterproof and the zippers are also waterproof.  There is a side zip door that houses your DSLR and up to two additional lenses (depending on length) with the adjustable separators.  This side compartment pouch pulls out if you want to just take that zipped bag.  It has a nylon strap handle and zip closure, looks sort of like a lunch pack.  Very handy if that's really the only valuable cargo in the bag and you don't want to have to take the entire pack with you for a bit.The pack itself weighs about 2.4 pounds.  It actually isn't that heavy considering everything this pack can carry.  It has a side zip compartment in the back where you can slip your laptop or tablet, oodles of pockets, zipped compartments, mesh zipped compartments, etc. Plenty of options for cords, cables, and more.  There is a side pocket for tripod storage with an adjustable strap to keep it secured.  All this and it even has room for other things like a jacket and a notebook in the &#34;regular&#34; storage section, which is plenty roomy.  If you are looking for a traveling camera bag, I think you will be as impressed as I am with this one.","rating":5},{"comment":"This bag is amazing.  It's built to last, easy to use, and designed to protect that camera equipment no matter what comes your way.  I love the  numerous ways to carry or wear it.  There are tons of compartments for every piece of equipment that you could even need to bring with you.  Highly recommend.","rating":5},{"comment":"As a full time teacher and writer, I almost always carry a big bag that holds a laptop, its plug, several books, notes and various accessories, including, usually, lunch and snacks. As an amateur photographer, I often also lugged a bag with my mirrorless camera, an extra lens, and other accessories. The problem is that ends up being a bit too much, and so I often left the camera home and just grabbed the bag, resigned to shoot pictures with my phone, or with a smaller camera that fit easily in my bag.This bag solves that for me. I can carry my laptop and everything else I need, and there's a secure pouch inside that protects and holds snugly both my camera and a couple of extra lenses or other accessories. It's got several pockets on the outside, a few larger inner pouches, and one very large pouch that fits a few books. There's a laptop sleeve that fits my 15&#34; Macbook Pro easily, it also has a notebook or folder pouch that I use for storing papers I need to lug to and from the office, and I can put the plug in one of the other pouches.There's room for a water bottle outside, and a variety of straps for lugging other equipment such as a tripod, or in my case the monopod I tend to use for most shoots.This bag is extremely well-built and solid. It is made of a tough but flexible canvas, with very strong seams and a close attention to design.My only minor gripe is that where the shoulder strap meets the bottom of the bag it gets somewhat in the way of inserting my laptop. What that means is I have to lift it up out of the way with one hand while I stick my laptop in with the other. It's really not that big of a deal, but since I do take my laptop in and out fairly regularly, it's something that stuck out as slightly less convenient than most other aspects of this otherwise quite useful bag.It's very comfortable on my back -- though for maximum comfort you do need to wear both straps. With an older bag I could sometimes shrug it over one shoulder, but since the back is somewhat rigid to support and protect the laptop, this one feels most comfortable when it's fully on and securely strapped.It would be great for the photographer out hiking, perfect for the student or professor who needs to carry a camera in addition to school gear, and it looks good enough for most office settings.They've managed to make this bag both very flexible and useful as well as good looking. In just a few weeks of use, I've actually gotten several compliments on the bag. I really like it and highly recommend it for anyone who needs to carry a laptop and a bunch of gear along with their photography equipment.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Case Logic TCDK-101 Covert Thule DSLR Rolltop Backpack is a well designed piece of gear that can be used to carry camera equipment or computer gadgets safely.  The backpack is heavy even before anything is put into it, and this should be considered if making the purchase for a small or young person, as the weight might be too much for some people.There are multiple compartments, zippered and snapped to hold fragile items secure.  This backpack is designed to keep your expensive equipment safe from trauma as well as excessive moisture.This back pack works effectively to fit your  computer gear, a laptop fits inside the main compartment, with many additional compartments provided for cables and other necessary accessories.  A camera enthusiast or professional photographer, will feel comfortable stowing  equipment in this heavy duty backpack, and  confidently know that their gear is safe for travel.While this is a multi-functional case, it's not practical for carrying basic travel items or clothing, as it's heavy.  It's made & designed well for your fragile camera and media gear, and for that purpose, it has unsurpassed quality.I highly recommend it as a gift for the college-bound photographer, or world traveler looking for a safe way to carry gear on long trips.  This backpack is built to last for years and is an excellent investment.","rating":5},{"comment":"It's hard to imagine a better backpack to take your high-end camera equipment, laptop, and light personal gear for a photography expedition.  It's obviously made by people who know cameras, since everything is really well padded, zippered off, waterproof, and easily accessible.  Your camera and lenses will go in one place (at the bottom) and your personal effects at the top, where they are protected by a rollover top and secured by buckles.  Nothing is going to just fall out of this pack!  Approximately 40% of the available space in the pack is devoted to camera gear, and the rest to other things (laptop, food, jacket, whatever).  The pack itself is surprisingly heavy, but you're clearly not supposed to fill it with books, so, filled with appropriate items, it shouldn't be too heavy.  The nylon itself is the sturdiest I've ever seen in a bac, again, made by people who know camera equipment.The upshot is that I love this backpack for what it's intended for.  It's probably way more than most people need, but for a combination camera bag\/laptop holder\/personal backpack, it's awesome.","rating":5},{"comment":"I don't care about Netflix! Amazon prime is better in my opinion and my Smart TV takes care of that already aswell as Netflix. Therefore this makes this device perfect and awesome. I'm watching anything from movies, tv shows to Anime and cough porn cough and this device will play anything. I have absolutely no interest about in-Games or Apps and whatnot. If you download anything and everything off the internet and requires an absolute master player this is what you need. I have yet in 4 years of owning this device found a file that i couldn't play. Updates are smooth. Menus and options are clear and easy to use, lots of customization available like themes. I can only reproach one thing about this device is that it hasn't come out any sooner, i just feel like kicking myself in the nuts for not having one earlier than that. Nobody should need overprice cable\/satellite with this thing. Remote has a great feel and navigation is ok. Any Sources either dlna server, usb hard drive, usb\/network drive like My Cloud etc they all work like a charm. Dropped the remote a few times and not even a scratch. Like the colored shortcut buttons and the subtitle\/audio seperate buttons on the top to instantly switch Audio track or Subtitles usefull for Anime.  I use it everyday and would have a hard time living without it. Tried the Roku, its more of a \"friendlier\" device, more fency and stuff but doesn't get his hands dirty as much, its like having a mini van. The WDTV is more like having a sport car that has one soul purpose and that is to play ANYTHING!","rating":5},{"comment":"Works great for my movies stored in my nas.  Only issue is the metadata does not load for a lot of movie.","rating":4},{"comment":"I initially had some issues and some of them are still valid with this unit. One, although it claims to play almost all file type, a number of the MKV files and even some MP4's I had played on my other streamer did not play. Add to that it did not pick up the faster wireless band. I can't complain too much because the 5 Meg band is still fairly new and my smart DVD, ROKU, and an older laptop do not see it either. My newer laptops do, and if this is a new product, they should have gone that way too. I'm sure most of the cable and web companies that give you a wireless router do support the faster speed, but I could be wrong. I run my own dual band router. I used to run a 300 Mbps NetGear, a very slow wireless, but through the Vine I got a 1750 Mbps (the speed is a little misleading, you are actually getting 450 Mbps in the 2.4 Mhz band and 1300 Mbps on the 5 Mhz band! Still, it's pretty fast compared to the old 300, and prior to that I think I ran a 150! The price is pretty good on this, it cost similar to what my old streamer cost, and I would have had to buy a separate receiver to use that for wireless, it's built in here, a plus.Despite the file issues, what impressed me was the quality of the picture that came out of this thing; I was blown away by the quality compared to broadcast, or even BR DVD's. I was half thinking my HD TV was very mediocre, in part because I watch mostly SD stuff on it. My old streamer must not broadcast in full HD, because the same exact files do not look the same when played by both units. This is much smaller and seems a lot cheaper made than my old streamer (a MICCA unit), still it's not like ROKU's are expensive looking and they perform pretty well too. The USB link play was a little tricky to find how to play the files, but not so bad when you get used to it. Picture quality is always the big decider for me with these things, so I have to give it a strong recommend. If they want to charge more in the future, they do have some things to fix. The firmware updates (mine was up to date), should include some facility to patch for the ever changing file driver support, this was not robust there, and if they have wireless then the 5G is important. You can still connect this at lightning speed, by giving it a direct wire from the router, but that probably depends on where you're router is, mine is in the bedroom with the desktop computer, everything else is wireless!The unit is easy to set up at least with the HDMI, but it doesn't come with that cable, so order one along with it unless you have spares like me. Connecting is the usual task of looking up your connection name, then using the cursor keys to move then select letters, numbers and symbols to enter the wireless password. Note, should not much trouble for the texting generation, it was a little trouble for me, more the QWERTY type by touch generation. Still, not likely most grannies will find it fun to set up, so not necessarily for the older generation set unless they are tech savvy. Now remember I'm rating this at the level of a file streamer with good picture quality, I connect USB hard drives or sticks to the USB and play the files. If you wanted this as an all in one smart streaming device, drop it 2 stars and go elsewhere. No Amazon, no Netflix, no CrunchyRoll, (my favorite anime service), so it's lacking. The price may be the reason, these services may charge license fees for the device vendor, or they may not have a compatible application version for the device, I don't know. I just know they are not there. If you just want to stream off the web, get a ROKU!","rating":4},{"comment":"Bought hoping Slingplayer app would work well. Doesn't.

The remote is easy to understand but uses IF signal, the Roku is RF and works great. It includes a HDMI cable and regular RCA cables. The box itself is small, about 5 inches square and 1 1\/2 thick. Why WD went ahead with this media player without the ability to play Netflix is a big question, this will clearly hurt sales.

Freezes a lot with files it \"supports\".  When it freezes (or has the refresh button stuck in the middle of the page) the remote becomes useless and you have to physically unplug the system and plug it back in.For some video the audio is not synchronized(though it wouldn't be for VLC), but this is fixable through the options menu to skip ahead or behind by 100ms.  Though sometimes when you adjust the player freezes and restart must occur.Unless I get a decent response back on my case number (#071214-8706588) from WD I plan on returning it and just finding a small form fitting cpu with hdmi out and vlc player.Was hoping Chromecast would work, but it doesn't really do local file playing very well (used allcast and the stream seemed to take up all the RAM on the router rendering the internet connection ineffective).  Also had to worry about the frame-rate\/quality being too high.My blu-ray player does pretty much the same thing, \"supports\" file formats then fails to play anything.  *slow clap*","rating":1},{"comment":"I bought this for use exclusively with my Slingbox.  When I checked the specs, I was a bit doubtful as to it's performance, but most of its' competitors have the same sort of specs, so I thought I'd give it a try.  In the past I have used a fairly high-powered computer to provide me with Slingbox service, and I use it while I live in Mexico (about 7 months\/year) to provide my USA television feed.  I had hoped to replace the computer with this little box---ain't gonna happen!  It's just not powerful enough to overcome the inherent difficulty associated with the technology that allows me to enjoy the Slingbox service, plus, the Slingbox App is not up to the job.It all works, but not too well, and certainly, several steps down from the quality I'm used to when using the dedicated computer.  If perhaps I had never used the service before, I would be satisfied with it, but having something to compare it to, makes it finish a distant second in a field of two.  I'm assuming that its' competitors will be performing at about the same level, so I will stick with my original set-up and keep this for an emergency.","rating":3},{"comment":"I am impressed with how Western Digital's WD TV Media Player provides an easy way to access and display personalized content through my TV.The WD TV has multiple inputs so that you can feed a data source to the player and then display the content on your TV. More than this, the WD TV has a very useful and intuitive interface that allows you to connect the online accounts you might have for music, photo and video sharing. For example, I found it easy to log into my YouTube account and stream a playlist I had created. It was great seeing it play on a large screen!  The video quality was very good, suggesting that Western Digital has put a lot of care into engineering the WD TV.Comparing WD TV to other media players such as Roku; as I might have expected the WD TV has a number of pre-loaded apps for entertainment, news, and etc. Compared to Roku, the selection seems a bit smaller overall but the WD TV does offer some features that I can't find on the Roku. For example, WD TV includes RSS feeds to a number of fascinating audio and video programs representing many different points of view.  I also like the option to pair a device, like a tablet or PC, to the WD TV to make it that much easier to get to the content I want to share.The negative is that I could not find the killer app, Netflix listed among the default apps. Apparently this is a licensing issue that needs to be worked out. Unfortunately, I believe the omission of Netflix will make this otherwise very impressive media player less desirable to people who are primarily interested in an entertainment portal.Overall, I think Western Digital has introduced a very useful product for those whose main purpose is to display their own personalized content (photo and videos) with the flexibility to choose from a large variety of formats. I highly recommend it to everyone.","rating":4},{"comment":"As many other reviewers have mentioned, this is a pretty handy media player if you're keen on using it for all of your funky media files.  I've been using this WD player for MKV and MOV files mainly, and it works speedily and like a charm.  Movies play flawlessly without losing and textures, and I haven't experienced any tearing.  The lack of certain apps prevent this from being a full-on five star product, but if you can go without some major streaming services, you'll be very pleased.My thumb drive has been getting a workout play MOV and MKV files, and this WD box plays them perfectly.  It also supports Hulu Plus and Vudu, so if you use these apps a lot this will be invaluable to you.  I've also used my smart phone as a remote for this box, and it's worked very well.  No, this box does not support Netflix, or even Amazone Prime, which is a bummer.  Personally, I have enough media players and app access through my TV where I don't much care about having those apps on the WD box, but it still is surprising it doesn't at least support Netflix!  If you're looking to buy this thing with the express purpose to stream Netflix or Prime, look elsewhere.I'm using this WD box as a primary source for local media files, and that's how you should think of it as well.  It really doesn't have a ton of movie apps available, but if you're main thing is streaming local files from your thumb drive, this thing is a dream to use.  It also has HDMI support, so those files look glorious with the right hookups.  Do your research before buying this, but this is an easily recommendable tool for media streaming.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a good player for your home media files, but it's not perfect.  It works, and it works pretty well so i'm giving it three stars (I like it).  I am not giving it four stars (I love it) because, well, I don't love it.  That doesn't mean this is a bad product, it does everything as advertised.  I turned it on, it asked to connect to my wifi network, I set it up and voila, easy-peasy.Now here's where it depends on your network.  If you already have a home media server on your network, then it should detect all your media files that you have shared.  My issue: all my files are shared on my 5GHz network.  This thing only operates on the 2.4GHz band.  Since my router splits the two as different networks, it didn't see my files.  So i manually reconnected one to the 2.4GHz band and it worked.  The quality was good, too.  I didn't try multiple types of files, but the one I tried worked fine.  If you have requests just let me know in the comments section and I'll test it.I don't care to use this because all my stuff is on the 5GHz network, and I don't care to go back to my 2.4GHz network.  It would be equivalent to changing all my home theater devices from HDMI down to component video inputs - I have a 1080 TV and components, why would I downgrade all of them to support one peripheral?Furthermore, my only useful app out of the box is Vudu.  There is HuluPlus, which I don't subscribe to, and YouTube which I never use.  And then there's CinemaNow, which is basically the same exact thing as Vudu, but prettier.I like the interface better than my Roku, and the fact that you can connect a USB drive to download media onto (in the case you buy\/rent movies from apps like CinemaNow) and stream directly from your home network would have made this thing five stars . . . . but come on, no Netflix?  No Amazon Video?  Deal breaker.  This will probably sit in my random electronics drawer until I find a better use for it.  This would have been perfect for my college years back when I had a ton of downloaded Kazaa files on my pc and refused to subscribe to anything that cost money!","rating":4},{"comment":"As with my other WDTV products, this media player's biggest advantage is that it can play almost anything you feed into it.  Most of my contents are in MKVs and this player plays MKVs flawlessly.  Most items you see on Amazon looks smaller than what it looks like from the pictures; the WDTV Media Player is surprisingly the other way around.It comes with a 100-240V50-60 Hz power supply so you can use it overseas without using a separate voltage adapter.  The remote control looks like a typical generic remote with included two AAA batteries.  It also came with a cable, one end is a 3.5mm plug while the other end branches out to a red, white and yellow RCA type connectors.  No HDMI cable is included.The first thing you do is to configure your connection to your wireless WiFi (You can connect it directly using an ethernet if you want. Alas, no ethernet cable is included.)  The screen showed, AOL HD, Cinema Now, Facebook, HuluPlus, MLB.TV, your music, your photos, your videos, Pandora, Sirius XM, Spotify, Vudu and YouTube.  Facebook interface is OK, you get news thread similar to a Twitter format but you can play videos and see pictures too.  The big one missing is Netflix.  Most of my sources for watching movies are Netflix, Amazon Video and You Tube.  That means I cannot rely on having a WDTV box alone,  I will still need to have a Roku, Xbox, etc.  That is a deal breaker for me.Somehow I cannot get audio on the AV port without serious static.  My Epson projector has HDMI but no audio out.  I would need to rely on a 3.5mm audio out to go to my audio system if I use it on a projector.  It has optical out but not all speakers have optical in.All considered, I rate this product 4 stars.","rating":4},{"comment":"I have a love\/hate relationship with WD. I love how this box plays all of my media - all of it - I love that.  I hate the UI - hate it. I hate the 3 second lag every time I press any button on the remote.  I hate the stupid swipe area on the smartphone remote - it is impossible to control.  I hate simple stuff like not being able to make one of my favorite photos the background image.  Yes it says it supports this but it does not.  And I hate how WD has managed to name every one of its similar products names that are ridiculously overloaded to the point where it is impossible to find online help for your product because it shares names with 5 other products.  WD TV. WD TV Live. WD TV Live Plus. WD TV Media. WD Live Player. WD Live Streaming Media Player.  Seriously? Are you serious WD - that's your product marketing genius?  Honestly I can't even tell which one this is - I just tell my friends \"it's the one that doesn't support netflix.\"In the end, it's sub $100 and it plays all of my network media and ultimately that's what these boxes are useful for.  But jeez WD - why go to so much effort to nail the hard part - supporting every codec in the western (and eastern!) hemispheres and then make the UI, remote, and support such complete horse shat.  Why?Edit 2014-07Okay Alberto Medina called me today from WD support and he helped me solve the problem of using my own image as the wallpaper - it turns out you can only do this from local media (USB).  So that's a bit of a workaround but hey I will give credit where it's due - they called me and solved this.  Kudos to WD for trying so hard.This is a good device and does what it should.  It is still a bit slow in scrolling through files but hey, nothing is perfect.","rating":4},{"comment":"I've had several models of WD TV, going all the way back to the first-generation unit. All through the device's history I've had two major gripes about the way they're designed. First, they've always been on the exceptionally slow side, especially when using local USB storage, and second, they have always been rather dumb and limited when it comes to getting info from The Movie Database. I'm a frequent contributor to TMDB, but even I don't like that the WD TV units have a tendency to change users' thumbnails without giving any choice, load the wrong info, and change user info that previously maintained film continuity. It also doesn't help that this device can't intelligently handle alphabetizing and dropping articles (a, the) from titles for such purposes.Now, a lot of this is avoided by using a media server or network share, but that's only because in this case you're not loading media info and don't have any backdrops or moviesheets. Still, when you set it up this way you get the best performance and it's worth dropping the extra bells and whistles to get the added speed and performance. This is how I usually ended up using my WD TV units.However, this new unit has done something unthinkable: They dropped Netflix. A set-top media streamer that doesn't support Netflix? This would be like a McDonald's that doesn't sell hamburgers. What were they thinking?! With previous models I could understand why people could be fans of the WD TV, despite the oddball media handling and speed problems... But this current model just throws away a lot of goodwill from the supporters. Add to that the fact that they don't offer Amazon Prime Video, either, and you get a streaming player that only streams from rental\/pay-per-view services, web video (such as YouTube), and B-list services that contain mostly public domain content.On the positive side, there are still a lot of apps on the device, and it apparently supports app development and apps loaded from USB, so perhaps someone will cobble together a workable Netflix\/Amazon solution.Other positives include the Miracast capability, the low profile, quiet operation, and the efficient and relatively easy playback of files on a network media server.In the end, though, the exclusion of Netflix in this device translates to Western Digital shooting themselves in the foot. The other reviews bear out this opinion. Honestly, I can't imagine any cord-cutter going for this when other choices exist now. Perhaps they could have gotten away with this when they were one of the only kids on the block, but these days? It's a bad choice for anyone who wanted an all-in-one device. Add in the slow performance, the tendency to not see devices connected via USB, the mushy remote control, and the price tag that matches other Netflix-equipped boxes, and you're looking at Western Digital's least-likable member of the WD TV family.Still, I -can- recommend it if you want a decent set-top box to connect to your media share. It handles most video, music, and photo files with no problems, and supports DTS and Dolby effortlessly. The easy connection to a media server is a major appeal. The included streaming apps and simple games are all decent and responsive.I'm giving it three stars, and that's about 90% based on the playback capabilities when connected to my Plex Media Server. If it had Netflix I'd give it four stars. If they put a beefier CPU\/GPU and more RAM in this thing so it wasn't quite as slow with USB content, I'd give it five stars, but considering the Micca line of devices can handle USB media without suffering the same horrible lag as the WD TV, I find it hard to forgive Western Digital for essentially cutting corners in their build quality... So three stars is where we stand for now.My Recommendation: If you don't need Netflix and Amazon Prime Video and plan to connect to a Network share or media server, this is a good choice for you. If you want an all-in-one solution, though, this isn't it. You're better served by getting an older model of the WD TV, or looking to devices from Amazon, Roku, Sony, Microsoft, or Samsung. I wish this weren't the case, but WD's marketing folks had to have some idea what they were risking by releasing a media player in this day and age without Netflix.Since WD says there are \"no plans\" to include Netflix, and they've never been real up on their support for Amazon, I suspect three stars will be the rating for a long time. I'm just baffled by the decision to cut out Netflix... They have to know that makes it a non-seller for a majority of their customers. So I close my review asking the question I've already asked-- The question everyone seems to be asking:  What were they THINKING?","rating":3},{"comment":"Western Digital has always been my favorite for years when it comes to media players for playing plethora of media file formats including cover-art and beautiful backdrops (which looks superb when scaled to 1080p with menu support) also supports Hi-Def MKV with 'DTS' audio, FLV, MP4, XVID, AVI, WMV, VOB and MOV and it does a very good job in rendering them on your big screen TV at full 1080p resolution without any problems whatsoever. Picture quality is excellent. Video Playback is smooth and with 'Optical Audio' link to your Audio receiver you are ready to enjoy true movie experience for everyone in the family.This new Western Digital WD TV Media Player reviewed here is the *newest* generation of their media players series and it still is the best one out there in today's market when it comes to playing media files which are locally attached to USB ports or streamed via your NAS. Granted the new generation WD TV Media Player does not have the APP for Netflix streaming but since Western Digital's reach is truly *global* when it comes to sales I think Western Digital will be still OK when it comes to making most of the consumers around the world happy with this product.Yeah it does frustrates big time for US customers who would like to have Netflix support. If you are one of those customers who likes Netflix streaming then this is *NOT* the box you would buy. Please grab the older generation (For a cheaper price) for Netflix supportWD TV Live Media Player Wi-fi 1080pwhile it is still available. This older generation box is by far the best one in the WD TV series available today which still has Netflix support and maintains the same line of local media file support.This WD TV Media Player is passively cooled just like the previous generations, there is no FAN noise absolutely silent sitting next to your TV and starts instantly. IMHO, menu structure is slightly better compared to previous generation of WD media players since it does allow for some amount of user customization and allows apps to be installed from USB. While there is not one available yet for this media player but the SDK is out so you can expect some developers to come up with new third party apps and games (Wishful thinking)Mochi(tm) UI interface is still available for selection which was earlier available onWD TV Live Hub 1TB Media Center (Old Model)(Discontinued but the very best) You can also get other customized themes from WD community or create your own themes if you know little bit of XML programming.PROS[+] Wireless display support (Miracast)[+] Built-in WiFi and connects effortlessly to Internet or Local NAS[+] Plays almost all types of media files locally (USB) and or via NAS[+] Slightly Improved UI interface compared to previous generation.[+] Manual or Automatic \"Metadata\" scraping for all media files.[+] Beautiful Backdrops and Metadata for all your media files![+] Starts instantly, No FAN, No noise, low power consumption[+] Support USB HUBs for multiple HDD connectivity and also for, USB Keyboard for comfort[+] Online Firmware updates and online user community is excellent for all WD media players.[+] Supports Tons of online services like Facebook, some online games etc; But you do not buy this player for online services. You buy this player only for playing local media files!CONS[-] No Netflix support (Big Bummer!)[-] Blu-Ray rips(ISOs) sometimes takes a long time to start especially WiFi - But plays okOverall, It is still one of the best player for playing Local Media files attached to USB drives, or NAS shares on your home network. IMHO, The performance and usability of online services are not that great but consider the online services as bonus!Final thoughts:---------------You are actually better off buyingWD TV Live Media Player Wi-fi 1080pif you do not care about Miracast wireless display. The exclusion of Netflix was a shocker. But still decent player for local media files. Three Stars!Disclosure: Before you like or dislike my review I would like to disclose that I received this Product from Amazon for free in exchange for an unbiased review for fellow Amazon shoppers like you.

We've given up cable and watch Netflix and Amazon Prime. I was very interesting in using this WD TV Media Player as I've had a number of WD hard drives over the years and they have always been very good quality.I'm sorry to say this was really disappointing. The only benefit over the Roku is that you can use many different types of media files if you stream your own content. Roku can only stream Mp4 files. This player streams most every format including MKV, AVI, WMV and more, which is nice but not worth the cost and you can pretty easily convert files.The big negative of this player is no Netflix or Amazon Prime. The set-up was pretty easy, but this is too expensive of a unit just to stream files and watch YouTube...","rating":2},{"comment":"This media player does not have the Netflix or Amazon Prime apps, however, it is a really good media player. If having either or both of those apps on your media player is important to you, keep looking, you needn't waste your time considering this media player. My Panasonic TV has the Netflix and Amazon Prime apps, so this media player not including those apps is not the slightest bit important to me.What is important to me in a media player is that it is easy to use, works well, streams my network content well, provides a top quality picture, and plays all file types. Well, I don't actually know if this player plays every single file type, it probably doesn't, but it has flawlessly played all the file types I've asked it to play, and it does everything else I just mentioned. If you're looking for an excellent player for your network content, this one is, in my opinion, the one to get.I've only owned this media player for about a month, but I really like it, and am really impressed with it. It works well, its picture quality is outstanding, and as I said, it plays everything I've asked it to. And personally, that's all I really want a media player to do. Consequently I am going to recommend this media player. In fact, I am recommending it highly. Do give this one a try. I'm quite confident you'll like it. And if you don't, you can just return it. Amazon makes returning stuff incredibly simple.If you have any questions about this media player, please feel free to ask, and I'll do my best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful.","rating":5},{"comment":"This Western Digital TV Media Player is a fine way to play lots of media formats. The user interface is easy and intuitive. Streaming media files from a computer of NAS works really well. WD Remote works well on my iPad too.It&#8217;s nice to have the ability to plug in an external USB storage to the WD TV. A small, but really handy feature is that it adds a keyboard which makes using Youtube much easier. The app also works on a Smartphone. I connect via cat5e, but it has wireless also.The only con, which is a big one for my family, is that Netflix is not on the player. It appears to be on the lower model, but not this one.","rating":4},{"comment":"Discovering Hulu changed my TV habits. I love it. Most of my favorite shows are older, and with Hulu I can watch them for free whenever I want. My all-time favorite TV show&#8212;The Twilight Zone&#8212;is available complete on Hulu, with all seasons streaming for free. There are also tones of cool documentaries and other free content on Hulu. I just have to connect an HDMI cable to my computer, and off I go.I would love to eliminate that step of the HDMI cable, and just be able to access sites like Hulu and YouTube directly on my TV. I don&#8217;t have a WiFi enable TV, but I keep hearing about devices like this &#8220;WD TV Media Player&#8221; that will essentially turn my TV into WiFi enabled. They have all been various degrees of disappointing. This one has been the best so far. It is easy to attach, performs as promised, but &#8230;&#8230; it only gives you access to the mobile version of the internet.Granted, I don&#8217;t know the ins and outs and whys and wherefores, but I do know that the mobile versions of websites are not as good as the actual versions of the websites. It&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t mind if I am using my phone&#8212;I don&#8217;t expect full access. But for on my TV, I want access to the actual sites, not the stripped-down mobile version. (Case in point, the mobile Hulu doesn&#8217;t have the free content that the regular version does. No streaming &#8220;The Twilight Zone&#8221; on this WD TV Media Player.&#8221;)There are some cool features of this media player. Some of the Apps available give you access to cool public domain content, old cartoons and some old films.  I enjoyed that.  But the fact that I only have access to the mobile version of websites like Hulu and YouTube renders this functionally meaningless. Back to the HDMI cable for me!","rating":2},{"comment":"This is a big heavy laptop and it's packed with every upgrade you could want.  I have replaced my old desktop with this and now no longer will be using a desktop, as I have always done for my extensive web development work.  This is faster and works better.I know this is a gaming machine but I wanted something with every upgrade available.  Yes, the internet flies faster now on this.  I have a fast internet connection that I pay a lot for and didn't realize that it was being slowed down by my computers.  Now that I have this, I can change webpages instantaneously. In fact everything I do on this is instant.This is too heavy for me to be moving it around much but that's ok with me.  It looks cool on the desk with its gorgeous lights.  It's a bit more processing power than I need but it's so much fun to have more than enough.The keyboard is possibly the best one you can get on any computer for us touch typists.  The screen quality is the best.  In face everything on this is the best.  The sound quality isn't good in spite of this boasting of Klipsh speakers and 5.1 surround sound.Otherwise this is top of the line in every way.This took me several days of making adjustments to everything:  the mousepad, with its numerous options for how you want it to work, the display, the lights, and the software.  No bloatware was included at all.  This does not come with any instruction booklet, but it walks you through the initial setup easily.  Still, all the needed adjustments to the mouse was a bit annoying but probably a luxury to gamers.I can't find anything to complain about with this.  It's fantastic.","rating":5},{"comment":"In a word, this laptop is beastly.As soon as you take it out of the box, you will realize just how huge (and heavy) this sucker is. By far the largest laptop I've ever owned, but it also has the power to back up the size.I honestly don't know much about the 'nuts and bolts' on computers and can't comment as much as others on the technical specs behind the machine, but here's what I know about this Alienware Laptop:* It's sleek and very cool looking* The customized lights are a nice touch* Speakers are great - very good for movies\/gaming* Super fast - no problem having multiple programs, windows, downloads going* Love the screen on this* Keyboard is full size, plus separate number pad. I love this . . . keyboards on laptops are usually too small for my hands* Tons of memory* Very fast start up* Runs very clean - have not had to restart it since I got itIf you are looking for a semi-portable gaming computer, get this one. Again, it is monstrous and its not something you will want to lug around everyday, but its nice that its portable when you need to move it. Highly Recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Mea Culpa edit:  After a lot more time with this laptop, I'm changing my rating from four to five stars. It's become clear to me that my criticisms over the size, weight, and battery life of this laptop were very minor nits.  The thing is, when you are looking for a big and powerful truck, it's kind of dumb to criticize it for being hard to park.  In that vein, if you're looking for Alienware stuff, you already know (or should know) that you're getting that big and powerful computer so weight and battery life are not priorities in the design.  As long as you know going in that this isn't going to be a svelte traveler or even a handy jack-of-all-trades laptop, but instead something entirely purpose-built for immersive gaming, you're going to be just as head over heels for this laptop as I am.  I've left my original review below.---Above-the-fold verdict:  This \"laptop\" is, simply put, very well built and powerful enough to do pretty much anything, and I mean ANYTHING, you want to do.  It's incredibly well constructed with its aluminum shell and magnesium frame...so much so, in fact, that it ends up with an intimidating tank-like appearance.  Show up at a LAN party with this and you will turn heads.  It is designed to plow through graphic- and video-intensive applications with little to no drama.  Not just for games, though it's marketed that way, it will make short work of any processor-intensive task you throw at it, like video editing.  The 1TB drive is supplemented by an 80GB SSD, so startup is very quick.  Although pricey, this computer arrives at the price point honestly.  You're getting top of the line components and an industrial design that makes it all work well.  Although there are minor issues like battery life and, let's be honest, the sheer size and weight of this thing, overall this is an excellent product.  For more details, read on for the TLDR version of this review...-----I have to say, I love Alienware.  The company currently exists as a kind of skunkworks for Dell.  They function as a sort of boutique computer division with but one mission - to make the coolest looking, most powerful laptops on the planet.  Some folks in the industry, me included, were worried that the purchase by Dell would ruin the brand.  I don't think this is the case...Dell wisely allows Alienware to have a great deal of independence in design while allowing the brand access to Dell's supply chain.  Therefore Alienware is still able to continue its mission while taking advantage of economies of scale.  This is important, since Alienware uses components that are all top of the line items.This particular product is a refinement of last  year's overall redesign of Alienware's laptop line.  Prior to 2013, Alienware made liberal use of plastics and such to construct their laptops.  The redesign, with the internal name of \"Epic,\" changed the laptop construction to favor anodized aluminum and magnesium.  The end result is a somewhat lighter shell and frame, but one that is more sturdy.  I know Steve Jobs gets a lot of grief for things, but one thing I think he did right was insisting on aluminum construction of laptops.  The Alienware 17 really does pop.  If this were a car, it'd be a BMW M6.  If it were an airplane, it'd be an F-22.Or, actually, maybe a main battle tank is a better analogy.  It's certainly built like a tank, with a strong, intimidating appearance.  Accent lights abound, and is probably the coolest darn thing about this computer.  The lights are fully configurable, so you could go dark green one day (if you're in a Borg kind of mood) and then switch to blue if you just finished watching Tron: Legacy.  Indeed, certain games make full use of the lighting to add one more dimension to the gaming experience...for instance, the lights may flash red if you take a hit or your character's health is low.  It's eye catching and a fantastic way to differentiate yourself from the crowd.  It works nicely in a normally-lit room, but dim the lights and you're definitely in for a treat.  The lighting is independently configurable in a number of zones on the computer as well so, for instance, you could have accent lights as one color but the keyboard show off in a different color.Now make no mistake - this is a BIG laptop.  17 inches and this isn't even the largest in the Alienware line, though I think it does the best in hitting that sweet spot between price and value.  The dimensions aren't there to simply be intimidating though...the large case enables the designers to do lots of neat things.  For instance, let's talk about the sound.  It has full stereo with front-facing speakers.  The dimensions of the laptop are there so that the speakers can be optimally placed to give you good sound quality.  You even get a decent bass line, something that laptops historically have trouble with.  The case dimensions also allow for plenty of venting, starting with two very large vents in the back and dual fans.  One is dedicated to the GPU, and one to the CPU.  Yes, designers have placed the processors on opposite sides of the case to allow for optimum cooling.  This wouldn't be possible with a smaller form factor, and it really does help to keep the thing as cool as possible while you are gaming.So as long as we're talking performance (and all those pretty looks and design elements mean nothing unless the computer performs), rest assured - you won't have a performance deficit with this computer.  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, about this architecture revolves around pushing the most data around in the lowest possible time.  We'll start with the 4th Generation Core i7 processor...four cores and hyperthreading allows the CPU to handle 8, yes 8, threads simultaneously...based on Haswell architecture.  It screams.  The CPU includes the Intel HD Graphics 4600 scheme which handles routine graphics processing (like Windows and stuff).  Complementing the CPU is the Nvidia GeForce GTX 880M GPU - quite probably the fastest single-chip mobile GPU currently on the market.  It includes technology that allows it to overclock itself for extreme graphics applications.  This GPU also has 8GB of memory BY ITSELF - in other words, the graphic processor has more dedicated RAM than some laptops have overall (yes, I know the summary on this product page says 4GB, but that's incorrect - the unit I was provided features 8GB).  Speaking of memory, you also get 16GB of very fast DDR3L memory, dual channel of course.Accessory to all of this are a slot loading DVD reader\/burner (no tray so hooray for that!), a media card reader, and a generous 1TB hard drive.  The system also includes an 80GB SSD, which has the function of acting as a cache for the hard drive.  This enables fast startup without the attendant cost of a full SSD, although with SSD prices starting to come down it's just a matter of time before hard drives are extinct.  Fortunately, this system enables very easy user access (taking the bottom cover off was a trivial exercise...in fact, you're going to want to regularly remove it to clean those fans anyway...) so you have a good upgrade path with this computer if\/when you want to replace components, add memory, etc.  Another design thought I appreciate - no I\/O ports on the back of the computer.  Your DVD drive is on the right, and your USB\/HDMI\/etc ports are on the left.  A standard (720p) webcam completes the ensemble.A quick note about networking and WiFi - there is some technical innovation behind the network card that allows it to prioritize certain data streams.  I'm not going to dissect it all, just to note that I was getting very decent throughput out of Steam when I was using this - ~6 MB\/s transfer rates.  Historically, latency has been a huge issue with online multiplayer, but from what I've seen here the computer design seems to minimize if not outright eliminate it - an included application allows you to prioritize network traffic in the computer so you can further optimize that data stream.  It works and it's easy to do.The display is lovely - 1920x1080 with good brightness. I have to mention that for this iteration, Alienware elected to use the AUO219D panel display, with a matte surface to reduce glare.  It features full HD resolution with a very good brightness level...302 cd\/m^2 in the center of the display, though it does fade a bit near the edges (as all laptop screens to) to about 277 cd\/m^2.  This is a display that is best suited for gaming, as gamers rarely venture over HD-level resolution.  Image stability is outstanding - I didn't notice much if any difference in image quality when I changed viewing angles...a definite plus when you're gaming and your SO is watching next to you.  I should note that if photo editing is your thing, for this price you could go with a Macbook Pro with a Retina display of 2880x1800, but then you aren't getting the sheer computing performance that the Alienware 17 gives you.  Main thing - this display is purpose driven for gaming and gives you a nice display (though not necessarily the *best* display) for professional-level photo editing.The keyboard deserves mention - it's underlaid by a solid piece of aluminum that supports the entire keyboard.  This means it's not going to flex in the middle or at odd angles as you type.  This is no small thing.  It contributes to the overall feel of build quality to the machine, and gives you a very solid platform.  Keys themselves have just the right amount of concave and texture to make it easy to use.  The key font is a little different than you're used to, though I have to say it's softened considerably from the Alienware keyboards of old.  You also have four user-configurable macro keys above the ten key numeric keypad (yes, a laptop of this size gives you a ten key in addition to the QWERTY, so cheers for that!).  The trackpad is also nice, though obviously not suited for gaming.  A neat effect - the lighting scheme illuminates the entire trackpad, not just the borders.  I appreciate the inclusion of the two buttons underneath instead of the reliance on multitouch to eliminate the physical buttons.  You can use multitouch if you want (it isn't set up by default, but it is available to configure), but it's nice to have an option.Mercifully, Alienware remembers its roots even now that it is a part of the Dell Empire and has resisted the urge to install a bunch of bloatware that you don't want on the machine.  Instead, Alienware gives you some utilities to help you manage your laptop, like AlienFX (to configure the really cool lighting effects), a very easy backup utility called AlienRespawn, and a tool to manage the four user-assignable macro keys called TactX.  That's really about it.  In other words, your system isn't considered a marketing platform for a third-party \"partner\" to factory-install a bunch of crap you'll never use.This paean to Alienware isn't without some criticism though.  It's a beast of a laptop.  It's big.  It's heavy.  The computer by itself weighs in at about 9.5 lbs, so calling it a \"laptop\" is kind of a misnomer.  It's luggable, but not something you'd carry around all the time and certainly not without the power brick (and it's a brick alright...at about 2 lbs by itself) with it.  Also, despite the great number of vents and fans (and there is significant cooling design built into this thing, including heatpipes), it does get hot.  After running it full bore for about thirty minutes, I measured 120 degree (F of course...) air coming out of one of the bottom fans.  You do NOT want to put this on your lap unless risking first degree burns excites you.  So put it on a table or desk.  That said, the computer is fairly thick, so typing on it can be a bit awkward.Now...battery life.  To be clear, in case it isn't by now, this isn't a laptop designed for road warriors.  You will not be happy if you are far from a power outlet, and the power needs of all this hardware are not insubstantial.  Some components of the computer do try to minimize power usage where possible, but overall if you're getting more than three and a half\/four hours out of a battery charge (on regular use - for full gaming you might get an hour, tops...that Geforce is a power hog...), you're doing well.  This alone does more to repudiate the term \"laptop\" when describing this computer.  It's more of a portable desktop than a laptop.  Another nit - the battery is integrated, so you can't carry a spare battery around.  So to sum up, my criticisms are of the beast-like non-travel-friendly dimensions of the laptop coupled with a battery that only lasts if you're doing the routine things a travel laptop would be doing.But all that said...how'd it do for games?  Well, I played Arkham City on it at max resolution (full HD, etc) and hit 60 fps.  The 2013 reboot of Tomb Raider hit 61 fps, again on \"ultra\" resolution and full Lara Croft hair effects.  On a single GPU system.  Yeah, that'll do.  Another game, Metro: Last Light, hit 57 fps at full resolution, and the game also featured a custom lighting theme for the LED strips so it was nothing short of fantastic.  Video work via Handbrake is similarly speedy.In the words of Han Solo:  She's fast enough for you, old man.So to tie this very long review up...it's not a \"laptop\" in the strict sense.  It's a portable desktop replacement, and if you approach it on those terms you are going to be delighted.  It offers industry-leading design and build quality, with the performance to match.  You have some compromises - battery life and portability being two of them - but when you're playing Bioshock Infinite you really don't mind them at all.  It's an honest, future-proofed machine purpose built for sheer graphics performance.  Enjoy it.","rating":5},{"comment":"I'm replacing an everyday ~$400-500 Compaq home laptop (contained a real Intel processor, not just a Celeron or equivalent) with this computer and using it the same way.  Here's what I've discovered:Before, if I started to get download speeds upward of 1Mb\/s, the fans would spin up and I'd get worried it might explode.  Performance monitoring would show the CPU being used 80% or more.  I never bothered trying to decompress 1080p H.264 *.mkv files locally because they would drop a bunch of frames and it would look worse than streaming with a bad Internet connection.  And transferring between multiple drives was clearly limited by the processor and not the USB2.0 ports.Now, I can easily sustain 3Mb\/s download speeds for hours, decompress 1080p from *.mkv files without a single dropped frame, and transfer quicker than USB2.0 would ever allow with these USB3.0 ports, all simultaneously* and without the fan kicking on past low.  All that, and the performance monitor is showing less than 40% CPU usage and NO GPU usage.  Oh yeah, and all the while, the LED lights all over this device are going nuts and generally looking cool.Frankly, I don't have the juice or the requirements necessary to bog this thing down.  But that's good - that means it should be a good number of years before it begins to feel dated.  Suffice to say, I can do all that other stuff in the background as a server function and never even notice it while I'm surfing the web or processing documents.It's bigger and heavier than my previous laptop, but I find that doesn't matter at all.  It doesn't really take up any more room where it sits in the living room, and once the lights go out, it fits in with its classic black look.  And it is clearly a quality product, so it looks better and fits in better wherever it is.  It's also more comfortable on my lap because it doesn't get hot easily (never that I've seen) and it doesn't have any sharp edges.I was worried about battery life, but I easily get three-five hours out of it when I take it to the kitchen to browse the web before dinner.  And that's with all the LEDs on and most of the defaults selected.  I'm fairly sure I could get a clean five hours by tweaking the settings.  And I would imagine that this battery should keep its life longer rather than degrading over time like most cheap laptops.  I say this just because cheap laptops always have you tethered to a wall after a couple of years, but I suspect that is because they also use cheap batteries.  Nothing about the Alienware is cheap, so I suspect the battery may always give me that same capacity.I love having a big internal HD and some (actually, plenty) solid state memory on different drives.  It has some automatic configuration set up, but it still shows as two drives.  I'm sort of unsure how that works so far, but I'll probably figure it out over time.  It'd be nice if they told you exactly what they were doing and let you input how you'd like it configured.Gotta admit, I love all the lights and stuff.  They do look cool and you can turn any or all of them off, or have them go out when the computer is at rest or whatever you want.  However, the back has lights and an alien head; I wish you could turn on the alien head and the other lights off.  Regardless, it's a heck of a lot cooler than a piece of fruit back there.I love 1080p screens even for regular computing because they are perfectly compatible with most TVs, which are large monitors most people already have around.This is one brand I sort of like, too.  I remember one project I had, I worked out of an Internet hall in a hospital because I didn't have an office.  One kid used to come in after working the night shift with his Alienware and play games all day long.  He didn't have a car, though.  Although I still don't get his priorities, I always remember that kid with the awesome computer.  And it is some kind of nerd status symbol that makes being a nerd cool somehow.  Does that make any sense?Anyway, now for the small annoyances:-It comes with a giant Dell rectifier pack that is probably larger than necessary for everyday use.  I don't think I'm sucking down much more power than a normal computer when just browsing the web.  Regardless, it has that blue LED ring around the end that never goes out.  That can screw up your color scheme if it does not involve blue (you could cover it in electrical tape if it annoys you).  I guess it's better than having something proprietary that would be hard to replace, but something to note.-Looks like the motherboard can handle 32GB of RAM, but to upgrade to that, you'd have to throw both existing pieces out, which is wasteful.  I could be wrong about that - I suppose it may have four slots; someone please comment if I am wrong.  I always want to get the RAM maxed out right away, but my estimate from looking at other models is that upgrade will cost another $500 or so right off the bat.  [Update 20 July:  Check the comments section - sounds like it is four slots, which makes this nicely upgradable!  Another reason to love it...]-No PCMCIA slot.  I know they're not used often, and most things can be done via USB dongle.  But an external card reader is annoying.  This is a big computer, so there should be room in there someplace.-Comes in a giant box with padding on the inside, presumably so you can transport it for gaming.  Should have made this a real thin, fairly cheap aluminum box, so it would be more worthwhile keeping.That's about it.  Everything else about this computer is amazing.  Recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have never had a laptop before but I really think this is the bee's knees.  Wow!  Everything about this unit screams &#34;I can handle it&#34;.  The unit is large at 17 inches and heavy at about 19 lbs and if my desktop goes I won't be getting another one now that I have this baby.  Audio is bomb, the graphics display is bomb, really quick response and startup.  I am also loving Windows 7.  Have Vista on my desktop and hate it but this 7 is easier and cleaner.  Setting the unit up initally takes just a bit but not to long so you aren't sitting there ancy cause you want to play.  It doesn't throw off any amount of heat so as to make it uncomfortable which I was happy about.  The mouse is very sensitive but very smooth.  No hesitation.  Battery life is about 3 to 4 hours but there is a lot on here to command power.  Doesn't take overly long to charge up which is a plus.  It does have a disc drive which I am eternally grateful for.  I do play games on here but I use it more for my photography and movies which it handles with ease.  My only drawback is I wish it had some kind of package software deal.  I tend to do a bit of spread sheets and word processing is almost an always so those are just as important as gaming in my opinion.  I'm not happy with the virus software.  It's generic at best and you'd probably do better without it.  Overall though I am very impressed with this machine and I know it and I will have a long and delightful relationship.  I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.  Take that as is but remember I am not an expert with these so I do hope you will do your homework.  Even said I think you would be more than happy here!","rating":5},{"comment":"This is an excellent hardware package with a blazing fast i7 intel processor, plenty of the fastest type RAM and a solid state hard drive which accesses data much faster than a traditional disc type drive. The carbon fiber back is an awesome touch that is the exclamation point on this cutting edge ultrabook. If there is any issue at all, its with the pretty much universally despised Windows 8. This is my first experience with it and I can say that its not intuitive at all. Being a PC user since the days of DOS, I jumped in without looking at any of the tutorials. I probably should have checked my enthusiasm at the gate and did more than read the occasional tips that pops up but I think I now have a basic understanding after spending the past several hours setting this computer up for my daughter.

No more!! With this one, each key averages 3 little LEDs behind it, which give enough light to do what I have to do.Also be aware that this is what I call a microlaptop, so it doesn't have a DVD drive. It does, however, pull in downloads really quickly, to get it set up. I also have to say that it's the only computer I've had that uses the built-in Microsoft products to speed up process for me; I didn't have to download Word, etc--I only activated them. I haven't a clue why my other computers couldn't do that, but anyway...Superb, TINY little laptop! MOST highly recommended! I only wish that there were a way to &#34;lock&#34; the screen into laptop mode; it can be annoying when it flaps, but at least it doesn't &#34;flap&#34; by itself... Otherwise, it's perfect, and maybe that one's just me.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is one of a new breed of convertible laptops created to take advantage of the Windows 8 paradigm, which allows use as both as tablet and a laptop. While this category is expected to grow, and the last year has seen some entrants from manufacturers such as Microsoft, Lenovo, Sony, Asus and HP, right now the number of options in this segment is still rather limited. Traditionalist approaches to providing both tablet and laptop functions have included a screen that flips 180 degrees around along a standard hinge  (certain Lenovo models, Sony, etc.) and a detachable keyboard (e.g. the Microsoft Surface Pro). Only two current entrants in this segment, at present, could be reasonably be called innovative in terms of design: The Dell XPS 12 (this one), and the Lenovo Yoga 13. The Dell and Lenovo sport similar power specs (cpu, memory, hard drive, battery life), but the Dell has a much higher resolution and better, screen. In my opinion, the Dell takes that competition handily. (Note, Samsung has announced a clever new convertible model, the ATIV Q, which looks promising, but which is not (at the time of this review) available for purchase).This is actually the second generation of the XPS 12, which replaces the earlier model which was released last year (Dell XPS 12 12.5-Inch Convertible 2-in-1 Touchscreen Ultrabook). The new version is almost identical to the older version in all physical terms, with the primary difference being that it's slightly lighter (about 3 ounces lighter). Under the hood, there is one very significant difference: This new model uses Intel's latest \"Haswell\" line of processors. These processors are APPRECIABLY more energy efficient than the previous generation processors (\"Ivy Bridge\") that were used in the previous iteration of the XPS12. This means that run time on a full battery charge has increased from around 5 hours to around 8 hours. (!!!!) That single change--to run time on a full charge--addresses what many considered to be one of the major downsides of the previous generation XPS 12. (Note: The two processor lines, Haswell and Ivy Bridge, are pretty close to indistinguishable in terms of performance, with the Haswell just ever-so-slightly better [PassMark scores of 3380 and 3278 for the I5 Haswell and Ivy Bridge, respectively, with higher being better]).A more minor hidden improvement for this second generation XPX 12 line is that the older Intel wireless N networking card has been replaced by the Intel Centrino 7260, which also supports the latest \"AC\" protocol. This will be increasingly important as top end wireless routers move towards the AC protocol over the next few years.The integrated Intel graphics have been updated from model 4000 to 4400. This will result in a moderate improvement in gameplay on games that require high end graphics performance, and also reduces somewhat power consumption.Dell has also added support for NFC to the most recent versions of the XPS12. NFC (\"Near Field Communication\") allows pairs of devices which are both equipped with NFC to pair quickly and effortlessly by just touching them together.Finally, this model comes with Windows 8.1 pre-installed. Earlier versions came with Windows 8, which can be updated to 8.1 for free, but which requires a 3+ Gb download. It's nice to be able to get started with latest and greatest out of the box.Now, focusing on the XPS 12 as a total package: This is a terrific piece of hardware, with a lot of pros, and only a few significant cons.Summarizing,Pros:Beautiful super high resolution 1920x1080 12.5\" screenVery high build qualityTerrific innovative screen that rotates in the frame to go from laptop\/keyboard to tablet configurationVery responsive with even the base configuration of an Intel I5 processor and 4Gb memory. The I7\/8Gb configuration I tested for this review is even nicer, and recommended if you will be using cpu\/memory intensive applications such as video editing.Incredibly fast boot time (10-15 seconds)Very good keyboardResponsive touchscreen which operates in both laptop and tablet modesFast SSD drive in all configurationsDecent webcam (1.3mp)Light, portable charging cable.Bluetooth, Wireless N (5 + 2.4Ghz)Backlit keys on keyboardBattery life is 8+ hours (New for this version!)Windows 8.1 pre-installedIntel Centrino 7260 networking card support latest AC protocol (in addition to N\/G)Intel 4400 graphicsNFC supportAll versions come with nice, small, travel-compatible power cord\/suppoles, but the latest versions of this laptop come with an even smaller and more portable version.Eh:Weight is 3.2 pounds, which isn't heavy, but isn't super light for a 12.5\" laptop. A bit heavy feeling in tablet modeSpeakers are predictably mediocre for a small laptopBase configuration has only a 128Gb mSata SSD hard drive. However, the hard drive IS user replaceable.Cons:No HDMI or VGA port. Only a graphics mini displayport, which means you will need to carry a mini displayport -> HDMI or VGA adapter if you want to use this for business or with a TV\/external monitor.Memory is soldiered to motherboard and is not upgradeable. Fortunately, even the base configuration 4Gb of memory is more than sufficient.Only two USB ports (both USB 3.0, however)Battery is not easily user swapped\/replacableNo built in media card reader. If you want to the SD card from your camera, you'll need to carry an external reader.No GPSNo wired Ethernet port. If you want wired Ethernet, you'll need to buy a USB-to-Ethernet adapter. (You have wireless Ethernet, of course).Of the cons, the worst, in my opinion, is the fact that the battery is not easily swapped\/replaced. While the 8+ hour run time is very respectable, one can expect battery life to diminish over time, and I am not looking forward to dealing with that eventuality. Also, I like to carry a spare battery to swap out for long trips. That's not possible here.Having struggled with various underpowered Android based tablets, including the Asus TF301\/keyboard dock, I can say that using the XPS 12 in tablet mode is like a huge weight has been lifted. The XPS 12 screams when surfing the web, which is something I can't say about any Android (or Mac) tablet I've used--and I've used a lot of them.People have complained about the lack of apps in the Windows 8 app store--and it's true that the Windows 8 app store is pretty anemic compared to Andoid or Mac. But some of the most important apps are there (Skype, Netflix, etc.) and it's still growing. There are enough to make using the tablet mode acceptable now...and the responsiveness provided by the Intel I-series processor (I7 or I5) makes it a pleasure to use.There are a few configuration options available for the XPS 12, all related to the processor (a few speeds of I5 and I7), memory (4Gb or 8Gb) and hard drive size (128Gb or 256Gb or 512Gb). My recommendation: Any of the available processor speeds will be more than acceptable, and the difference between the I5 and I7 processors for almost any user will be negligible. Similarly, most users will not need the 8Gb of memory. Windows 8 runs perfectly fine on 4Gb of memory. Unless you plan on running memory hog processes (advanced video editing, certain scientific apps, etc.) you won't need the extra memory. If you do need the extra memory, however, you need to order the laptop with 8Gb installed from the factory, as the memory is not user-upgradeable (it's soldiered to the motherboard...grrr...) A larger hard drive than the 128Gb SSD that comes installed on the base model is definitely a nice feature. But the hard drive IS user replaceable, and the incremental cost of getting the 256Gb mSata SSD from Dell is more than it would be to buy that 256Gb mSata SSD on the aftermarket and clone your 128Gb drive onto it. (You will also wind up with a spare 128Gb drive that way). Unless you are scared of the idea of hard drive cloning\/migration, I'd recommend that path. Please note that this laptop uses the mSata configuration hard drive, rather than a full sized SSD to save space. mSata drives tend to be a bit more expensive than standard SSD drives.Overall, this is a terrific laptop, and buying the least expensive configuration version is, for most, the recommended route. In addition, the newer generation processor used for this updated version of the XPS 12 had addressed one of the major limitations of the earlier version, bumping the battery life to over eight hours.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is my first experience with a touchscreen laptop, and I must say I am very impressed. My first thought was why someone would pay extra for a touchscreen that flips and makes it more like a tablet. Now I understand...it's really - really useful. It comes with Windows 8, which I am used to on my other laptop, so no learning curve for me, although if you are not using Windows 8, you may need to spend a few hours just learning the OS. The processor is a monster in my opinion, and the laptop is blazing fast. 8GB of memory and the fast processor provides plenty of horsepower when  multitasking. The convertible screen flips easily and the response to touch is spot on and impressive. The laptop offers the ability to login using your face (yes, your face) but I don't see that as really useful - though you might. The only downside I can imagine to this laptop is the price. However if you consider it's really two devices in one, and the cost of a comparable laptop and an iPad or Surface tablet, the price seems a lot more reasonable.It has really opened my eyes to a single device for a laptop and tablet. If you are considering upgrading to a newer laptop, I encourage you to check out a convertible laptop such as this one before purchasing just a standard laptop. I was not disappointed, and I doubt you will be.Note: It does not come with Antivirus software, but honestly, I would have just uninstalled it anyway and installed AVG or something similar , so it wasn't a negative for me.","rating":5},{"comment":"For the past few years, I&#8217;ve had a dell desktop (as my &#8220;real&#8221; computer) and a variety of android tablets: Nexus 7, Amazon Fire, Samsung 8.9.  I finally decided I was tired of the android operating system limitations, and have recently been using an ASUS T100 windows tablet for my daily news feeds, email, web surfing, etc.  Admittedly, the comparison is not fair, since the ASUS really is a tablet with a keyboard, whereas the Dell is a full-fledged laptop. But the difference is astounding. The screen on the Dell is very impressive.  First off, the 12.5&#8221; screen is much bigger than the 10&#8221; on the ASUS giving you significantly more desktop.  Startlingly clear with rich deep colors.  The 1920x1080 screen resolution is very detailed, allowing easy viewing of even small type.  The keyboard is individual raised chiclets, back lit, with very good action.Another notable feature is the sound.  Even my wife, who is not a music fanatic, could tell that the sound from this computer is a step above.  When I watched the first 30 seconds or so of the Transformers: Dark of the Moon video, the soundtrack sounded like surround sound, with the sounds in the beginning actually seemed to swirl in a 360 degree pan around my head.  Impressive.  Much deeper bass, and a richer sound all around, even when connecting via blue tooth to powered speakers.  Just a richer sound with some decent punch.The other notable difference is the fourth generation i7 Intel chip.  This computer is FAST.  I have recently begun experimenting with home recording on my desktop (i5 chip) and was having a lot of trouble with latency and hesitation.  When I tried using this Dell laptop, suddenly it all worked.  I was doing stereo USB multi-track recording without a hitch.  Impressive.Having the ability to &#8220;convert&#8221; this into a tablet shape is helpful, especially when doing your morning email\/news feeds at the breakfast table.  No more crumbs in the keys!  However, its heft (3.3 lbs) somewhat precludes the ease of use generally associated with tablets.  The flip screen concept seems an odd approach initially, but does appear to be ruggedly engineered and sturdy, and allows me to simply flip the screen over to share a video or article I&#8217;ve been looking at.I have to admit I have become a fan of Windows 8.1 also.  The ability to go from touch screen apps for casual use, to the standard windows desktop to get stuff done, is great.  Plus you get all the benefits of a full-fledged Windows operating system: flash, Office, etc.  Recently used programs swipe in from the left, making it easy to return to other open programs.  The screen automatically splits when you click on a link to take you to a web page from, say, email, leaving your email still up on the screen.  When you&#8217;re done with the web page just slide it off the screen, and your email program returns to full screen.  Very useful.  PDF&#8217;s do the same thing.I did initially have a problem with the screen not orienting correctly when flipped.  When I contacted the Dell techs, they were knowledgeable and efficient, quickly took over my computer remotely, installed new drivers, etc.  When that didn&#8217;t solve the problem, they ordered me a new part and sent a tech out to fix it.  I was very impressed with their support.All in all a great laptop.  I&#8217;ve actually sold my desktop and am using this laptop in place of both the desktop and my tablet.  Highly Recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Dell XPS 12 is an Intel Ultrabook with a screen that flips to become a tablet, and it looks handsome and well-made.  The woven-pattern carbon fiber body and aluminum frame are a distinctive combination and they feel  good in the hand.  The keyboard feels solid and is backlit.  The touch screen has a beautiful picture and is very responsive.  It flips effortlessly to tablet mode, with a two second delay for display reorientation.  The Samsung SSD gives a fast startup and the Core i7 processor and 8GB of RAM make it very responsive and speedy in use.There are a lot of thoughtful details, such as the power adapter that can be plugged directly in the wall or used in-line with a detachable power cable, an LED indicator for remaining battery capacity that can be turned off, a button to disarm the gyroscope, a sliding on-off switch, and a USB port designated for charging electronic devices.  Camera, microphone, speakers, touchpad, battery: all are high-quality components and work very well.The Mini DisplayPort allows painless plug & play connection to an external monitor.  However, when attempting to use an LG television as a primary or secondary monitor via WiDi, there were multiple problems, and I ultimately abandoned that effort after several wasted hours and software downloads.  That was a big disappointment, although it is simple enough to play media files on the television via networking and the  DLNA server software.There are some minor inconveniences.  When in notebook configuration, the screen sometimes flips unintentionally when touched near the top, and at other times the entire notebook tips back, as it is slightly top-heavy.  The only other concern is that the body and screen both smudge easily.  A microfiber cleaning cloth should be included with this device.Where this Ultrabook falls short is as a tablet, because it is awkward to handle.  There is really no way around this given today's technology, as it is primarily due to its weight, which is 3 lb. 5.3 oz. (1512 g), compared to an iPad Air, which weighs much less than a third of that.  This makes it uncomfortable to hold for long periods, despite the long ridges underneath that provide a comfortable grip.  The fingertips inevitably end up over the vents underneath and exposed to uncomfortable heat. The aluminum frame flexes separately from the screen.  The best use for the XPS 12 in a tablet configuration is perhaps for video, as it can form its own easel when left slightly opened.Overall, this is an high-quality 12 in. notebook physically and functionally, but combining two forms in one makes for a somewhat clumsy tablet.","rating":4},{"comment":"Okay... this one won me over big time.

Within its 12.5\" x 8.5\" x 0.79\" 3.34 lb body it houses a powerful Intel Core i7-4510U Processor, 8 GB DDR3L SDRAM, a 256 GB Solid-State Drive and an Intel HD Graphics 4400 chip. The hardware configuration is powerful and snappy! It is instant on, handles Windows 8.1, touchscreen interaction, browsing, audio, HD video playback, productivity software, digital audio\/video editing, publishing tasks, etc. with relative ease. The only exception is gaming - which is above average, and does not compare to a custom configured gaming laptop (Again this is an Ultrabook!). The Intel HD Graphics 4400 chip works fine as long as game settings are at Low or Medium.The XPS 12 has its stereo speakers on the left and right sides. The HD Audio with Waves MaxxAudioB. Pro offers a great audio experience. The volume gets loud enough to enjoy audio and movies without headphones.The convertible concept of the XPS 12 is unique and successful. The screen flips within the aluminum frame and the outside rigidity\/integrity of the Ultrabook is maintained. Unlike theLenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13 13.3-Inch Convertible 2 in 1 Touchscreen Ultrabook (59359564) Graythe keyboard is protected and countertop friendly with this convertible concept. However the spring-clips (to secure the screen) located on the top of the frame are not well designed or sufficiently strong as even slightly excessive pressure will push the screen out of the frame.The keyboard has soft chiclet keys that are well-spaced and backlit. The backlit seems to have two brightness options - full and medium. It comes with the standard function keys that are dual -purposed with the F keys.Dell has done an exceptional job with the design, materials and engineering of this Ultrabook to make it attractive, light-weight and tough. The Corning Gorilla Glass display is proven in the smartphone touchscreen industry and is extremely tough and responsive. The use of Carbon fiber and Machined Aluminum besides keeping the weight down and providing more toughness than a plastic body, looks Amazing! Rich matte Carbon fiber finish with machined Aluminum accents are super classy!I cannot visually see any wired connectivity between the screen and the keyboard base. There seem to be only two dedicated connection points between the screen portion and the base - the pivot points which enable the screen flip. I guess all wires must pass through these tiny pivot points.The XPS 12 Ultrabook falls short with ports - It comes with 2 USB 3.0 ports and a Mini DisplayPort. I wish they had provided an HDMI instead of the Mini DisplayPort. I am currently using theAmazonBasics Mini DisplayPort (Thunderbolt) to HDMI adapterwhich does provide audio and video support.Pricey but Definite Recommend.Quick Specs:Screen Size: 12.5\" diagonalWeight: 3.34 lbsL x W x H: 12.48\" x 8.46\" x 0.59-0.79\"Materials: Carbon fiber composite display back and base, Machined Aluminum accents and Magnesium palmrest with soft touch paintIssues:The Touchpad software seems to be a Dell customized version of Synaptics software.

They can be expensive but they last forever and will run pretty much any software, however demanding, you throw at them.First, the good...It comes with Windows 7.  For those of us whose only experience with Windows 8 has been turning off all the swiping options and setting the desktop view to 'traditional', Windows 7 onboard is a really happy thing.It's fast.  Wow, it's fast.  Handled Everquest 2, handled playing DVDs, handled everything I threw at it.The screen is gorgeous.  It has a glare-resistant coating so a bright environment is not a problem.  I sit with my back to a south-facing window, so a glare-resistant screen is a necessity.It boots up fast, because the operating system is on a small (80 gig) SSD.  Too bad I couldn't figure out how to install more applications there.  I did wonder...Mine came without a boatload of shovelware installed.  It has McAfee for security and things like Adobe reader are there, but none of the 'try and buy' stuff that usually comes with a new PC.Now, the bad (but none of it is really all that bad)...It's heavy.  This machine is portable inside your home but I do not think you'd want to carry it around anyplace else.There's only (!!) 8 gigs of memory.  I'd rather have 16 or even 32.  But memory is an easy upgrade to do at any point in the futureThe hard drive can be slow under heavy loads.  I really like seeing a faster drive in a workhorse like this one.My conclusion is that this is a great PC.  Alienware is not cheap but they have a quality that makes you know you will never need a desktop PC again.","rating":5},{"comment":"Before I get to what I really love about this machine let me clarify that the reason for four stars rather than five is simply because of price. Any item this expensive requires the purchaser to be 100 percent happy with every aspect, so something small that's unimportant to me might be an annoyance to someone else. I think the price is appropriate for a machine of this caliber, but it's still expensive of course.This is a top-flight rig. For the purpose of this review I am comparing it to my desktop (2009, Gateway, Windows Vista, 6 GB DDR 2, AMD Phenom 9550) and an Acer laptop (brand new, Windows 7).The Alienware blows the desktop away in every aspect - speed, performance, quickness, boot-up. The Acer holds its own at the basic level, but that's a very simple machine that I do office-type work on, certainly not gaming.Boot-Up: The Alienware takes about a minute, if that. Granted, there's not many programs on it yet, but it's nearly immediate. My current desktop takes five minutes to boot.Noise: Whisper quiet. You wouldn't even know its on except when I downloaded a game, the fan revved up a little bit. Still very quiet. My desktop sounds like a motorcycle in comparison.Set-up: It's a lot of fun going through the color combinations and light bars. Is it necessary? Not at all. Is it kind of neat? Yes. I chose light blue for the bars and yellow for the keyboards - nice soothing colors. The reds were way too harsh for me! But there's some 20 choices, so you'll find a color that you enjoy.Also, I like how there are different combinations of powerdown and password protection depending on if the computer is on battery vs. cord power. So if it's at home it can just shut down after a hour, but if you're on the road you might want to let it sleep instead (or the reverse).Screen Graphics: Crystal clear as you would expect.High-Def Screen: Better than my three-year-old Samsung SyncMaster monitor. In my monitor, the blacks are very deep and you lose images in the background. In the Alienware, you can still see images within the blackness (I compared a few music videos).Sound: OMG. The speakers are much better than my desktop's aging external speakers - and it can't even be compared to the Acer. It's funny how tinny the Acer sounds in comparison. They are as loud as you want, and while they do have some tinniess at the higher volumes it was nothing that bothered me - I would never have them that loud.(This is why it's four stars, not five. Because somebody might get this and totally disagree and say the sound is terrible and you need a $200 external speaker system...I think it's fine, but I'm a casual gamer at best.)Game Graphics - Amazing on the hi-def monitor. Although I'm sure they're equal to many other computers.Game Play - THIS is the difference. It's hard to put in words comparing it to my (aging) desktop, but it's like everything is a heartbeat faster and crisper in every way. So it's not like you say \"hey, this is way faster\" but it's more subtle - everything feels cleaner and moves with a fluid motion I wasn't used to before. So the game play is seamless - when you want to move, you move; when you shoot, you shoot. This is comparing it to a desktop where everything's a heartbeat...off. For lack of a better way to describe it.Size - Um. It's not the laptop you'll say \"I'm going to Starbucks to get a latte and check my email! Yay!\" This thing is heavy and big and tough. It's not an on-the-go model. nor is it pretending to be one. This is a seriously heavy duty piece of machinery. You're also not going to sit with this on your lap.Ergonomics - The touchpad is big and very responsive, which helps game play. I don't like how far up the keyboard rests. I end up leaning way forward and it's not comfortable. Since this will ultimately replace my desktop, I'll hook it to a monitor and keyboard - and most gamers will probably do the same.Minor flaws - it's not fair to even call these flaws since it's me being backwards technology-wise. Still, I wish it was VGA compatible so I could use my current monitor with it without a VGA-to-HDMI adapter that will kill the video quality. But who's kidding who - in a year no monitor will be VGA anyway. Same with the keyboard, which will need a USB.Little benefits - It has five USB ports and an HDMI input. I don't know why you'd need more than that for a laptop And I like how it has a DVD player built in, so you're not reliant on downloads or a portable DVD player. And 1 TB of memory is nearly double my current laptop's disk size.Bottom line - it's the real deal. You're paying top dollar, and I think you'll feel confident you got your money's worth. It FEELS like it's an expensive, high-end product - the weight, the frame, everything. It could be lighter and smaller, sure, but that's not what it's for.It's funny comparing this to a simple portable laptop like the Acer (which does a great job for what I use it for) and the aging desktop. With the desktop, I figured \"hey, it's okay, a little old, but it's still doing alright,\" and then Alienware comes along and it's like comparing Ferngully to Avatar.

The only downside to this that I've found so far is that it is pretty heavy and isn't a laptop that you'd really want to be lugging all over the place.**Edited to add--After using this for a while I can say that the graphics are intense! The computer loads very quickly and we haven't experienced any problems with it at all. You can also change the color around the outside of this so it doesn't have to only be blue. You can change it to anything you like and personalize it for your taste.","rating":5},{"comment":"This was my first experience with an Alienware machine. Previously, I had only used other types of desktops for gaming - those which were not built specifically for games and did not include any extra bells and whistles, but were serviceable in playing the games that I wanted to play. I found that an Alienware is pretty much the MacBook of the gaming experience - higher priced, polished, and slick in most respects.Packing:This is an impressively packed machine that reminds me of the packaging I got on MacBooks or iBooks in the past. It comes in a briefcase-style box that is covered with the sort of firm foam packing that you see in cases that hold guns in movies. If you save the box, you can use it to transport the computer safely.Durability and design:The case is a metal composite so it has a nice feel and seems to be sturdy and substantial. This doesn't seem to add significantly to the weight (I think that comes from the number of components and the size necessary to fit them inside). The display is strongly hinged, so it's unlikely to undergo stress cracking over time (unlike some of the lighter weight laptops that I've owned). The edges are covered with what feels like rubber to make it more comfortable, but since it is rather boxy, you'll likely need a wrist rest to deal with the height.Weight:This is a heavy laptop, but it's not designed for extreme portability. It's designed for mobile gaming experiences and mainly can be seen as a laptop replacement. If you need to pack it up and put it in your car to go to a LAN party, it's going to serve you well, but don't expect it to be a good choice for carrying around in a backpack around campus. This is a gaming machine and designed for power rather than ease of carrying.Alien Effects (lighting):This has some bells and whistles to make it a better experience for playing in dark or dim lighting conditions including the rather cool ability to program the keyboard to light up certain keys. When you're gaming in darkness (so you can see the gaming environment better), this is a nice feature. The \"alien effects\" have a default of lighting up the trackpad and various parts of the keyboard. You can disable these with a hotkey, but they will also dim with inactivity so they won't distract you if you're in a dark room trying to sleep and don't want a lot of lights. You can also program Alien Effects to change colors for certain actions (like receiving an e-mail), so that's a somewhat practical and nifty feature. You can set up profiles rather easily and manage the lighting for varying gaming experiences.Heat\/Ventilation:There are a lot of vents on the bottom of the computer and it is elevated off the table slightly by molded feet. This is integral for gaming as there is a tendency for machines to overheat while playing and simply shut down. I can say that it runs pretty cool for something with significant processor power.Keyboard and Trackpad:The trackpad has much better tracking and sensitivity than cheaper machines. My machine shipped with Windows 7 Home Premium, but some of these models ship with Windows 8 and I've heard that the default settings\/driver has different settings which can cause the cursor to keep moving when you move down toward the bottom of the trackpad and lift your finger. If you have these issues, you can use the Alienware settings to change the scrolling settings (disable edge motion).The keyboard's \"touch\" and feel are very nice and fine for touch typing as well as for gaming. I generally game using the keyboard as much as possible and the full-sized keyboard is very important to me, particularly having the up\/down\/left\/right arrow keys positioned properly. It's also good to have a proper keypad that can be used for games. If you are used to a more sprawling full-sized keyboard, then things are slightly more compact, but this is to be expected on a laptop.Display:The size of the display is chosen for gaming preferences, and it has a matte finish so glare is not as much of an issue. However, it isn't as good looking as some other displays and could be better - the colors seem just a little washed out to me, but that could be something that I need to tweak in settings. I'd prefer a higher default resolution (and any other than the default on an LCD is going to look fuzzy as it's interpolated(, but I think it really is optimal for the gaming resolution (1080 px) that most people are playing at.Battery life:The graphics cards switch off according to the power required by the application that you are using. For example, it won't use the Nvidia graphics (which is more energy-intensive) when you are browsing the web. Using the integrated video for lesser tasks will extend the battery life so this is a nice under the hood feature which is not quite so noticeable. Nonetheless, this is not built to run long on batteries and even with optimal use, you probably aren't going to get more than four hours out of it. As I said before, this is not designed for portability, but it can serve you for awhile on battery power alone.Media readers:There's a slot-loading DVD reader, which is slick. However, there is a bit of soft felt-like material lining the inside (this is common) and mine was slack and actually started to come out of the drive. I only used one disc in it (as most games can be installed with downloaded installers), but I have to wonder if this will eventually create a problem either by causing a disc to get caught on it or simply collecting dust as it hangs free a bit. This strikes me as the only serious \"sloppy\" design element in an otherwise fairly carefully designed machine.Gaming:I'll admit that I did not take this through its paces with all of the highest end games out there. I mainly play Guild Wars 2 and Diablo III. For Guild Wars 2, using this was a vast improvement over my old PC. The colors, textures, and visual effects were an order of magnitude better and the game play was much smoother, especially for loading in new areas (always a bit of a bottleneck before). Diablo III was also better, but not by the same large margin (because Diablo III is generally built for lower-end machines).Conclusion:This is an expensive machine, but it comes with a lot of bells and whistles that you won't get in other computers. It also has a lot of power and has an excellent speaker system for a laptop as well as great ability to play intense games. It's a polished product that serves the needs of gamers who need a small footprint, mobility, and a customizable interface that facilitates a smoother (and flashier) gaming experience. It's likely not the cheapest price for the power, but other aspects are brought to the table other than raw power. Sometimes it's not only about value, but about the type of experience the machine can offer you and this offers a sense of a machine that actually is fun rather than simply facilitating your fun through gaming. Whether that's worth paying a bit more is a matter of personal preference.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Alienware 17.3 Gaming machine makes me feel like a geek in a candy store: it's that awesome. This was one of the best birthday presents I've ever received and I have the Vine program to thank for this gift.  This computer is just beyond anything I've ever owned, and I literally have built my own machines from scratch, owned and fixed many laptops, etc;. Alienware tops them all.If you're a fan of the show 24:Live Another Day and its resident hacker Chloe O'Brian, then you know that Alienware is the computer brand that Chloe uses as a communications unit within the show to help out Jack Bauer.The chassis is well-built with a magnesium-alloy. There are lights on both sides and the back of the machine that light up crystal blue, along with the &#34;ALIENWARE&#34; logo below the laptop screen. I thought when I first received this machine that I would be limited to the color blue for the light scheme. I was blown away to know that you can change the color scheme on a whim with the Alienware Command Center (under the option Alienware FX). It's beyond awesome. I created my own color theme with the center, changing the light scheme on the side from a dark blue to a hot pink, and the lighting scheme with for the keyboard now has a sunset gradient that I've created from scratch. You can also change up the lighting for the power buttons, mouse and the back of the monitor. I love to have a machine that is not only beautiful, but practical (allowing me to program), without having to necessarily use a MAC, and ALIENWARE does that.I love that it also uses the Windows 7 Operating System, rather than Windows 8, which I don't care for, and is on the other laptop I recently purchased last year. The machine has two earphone ports for gamers. It has an SD-RAM slot above the DVD ROM slot. It also has four USB ports. I had a little problem with the USB ports recognizing some of my portable devices, however, including my Seagate Hard Drives and my Kindle device.The hard drive is also 1 TB, enough room to put whatever stuff you like on your machine. I plan to repartition mine to eventually place a second operating system on it (LINUX) and have it be a dual booting machine in the future. But, I think if you have these gaming machines made, there is a way to request LINUX be added as an O\/S on your machine too.The sound system was another plus for me. The Klipstch speakers have Dolby Surround Sound, and produce quality sound for music and videos. I could finally ditch my plug-in speakers that I used for my old laptop. The graphics are beyond anything I've ever seen. Everything is sharp, crystal clear and beautiful.I'm in love with this fantastic computer.","rating":5},{"comment":"We're very happy to get the opportunity to review this laptop and put it through the rigors of seeing what it can do. I will caveat that we're not a heavy PC-Gaming household, but we do have a modest selection of games through Steam that require an i7 processor, so there was a chance to put it through a fraction of the gaming gauntlet. Otherwise, I loaded this up with everything that you'd expect from a typical heavy-use, home user and then some.I'll start off with my criticisms:  If you're going to go this route, I definitely feel the SSD should have been bigger. The 1TB, 5400 RPM drive that comes with it, strains when I'm running multiple applications or high-intensity installs. I've been able to work with it, but I'm not thrilled with the way the partition combines the 80GB SSD for the OS and the 1TB drive for the data. I'm sure this is an antiquated way of thinking, but I have seemingly no control of what is installed where.Additionally, I'll add the Windows Experience Index comes in at a paltry 5.9 due to the hard drive speed. Otherwise it's 7.5 for graphics, 7.7 for processor and a nice 7.8 for memory. Aside from the hard drive, this is on the same level as my home-built battle station - which is impressive for a laptop.I will note here that the on-board graphics are great for a laptop, but when I plugged in the HDMI to the big screen, I was blown away with the improvement. There is a significantly better screen quality when I play a movie from Netflix on my 42\" Sony Bravia, than on the laptop screen. I really didn't notice any shortcomings with the screen until I saw a comparison. I will assume that's a testament to the video card and count it as a positive.The fact that it doesn't have a Blu-ray drive is very disappointing. The graphics are extremely sharp and the 17.3\" WLED is very impressive. The documentation also states that it's a 9-in-one card reader, but I only count 3 (and none of which is an XD unfortunately for me). The four USB 3.0 ports are extremely helpful, and I am so glad that machines like this come with an HDMI port that transmit audio along with video. That's a very positive upgrade for me from previous-generation laptops.The startup time is excellent (better than my main PC also with a Samsung SSD), and in most cases the hard drive slowness doesn't impact the operation, except when it comes to installing programs. Installation of CyberLink PowerDVD 14 was painfully slow and took 4 tries, but it was fine once it was installed.  The exact same thing happened when installing Wolfenstein: The new order. It was slow - painfully slow. This might be the result of running other operations in the background, but it took over an hour for each of these two programs to successfully install. That's a LOT slower than I find acceptable.I'm not a huge fan of McAffee anti-virus, but luckily since it only comes with a 30-day subscription, I don't have to be. I'll let it go for another two weeks and then uninstall and put on one of the comparable free options. I am a bit surprised that there's only a 30-day subscription that comes with a rig of this size.Now the impressive parts:Once the programs are installed - they're fast. The internet connection using wireless is just as fast as my wired connection (although that's probably more attributable to the high-speed router), but I have no issues when pulling HD videos from the NAS on a wireless connection.Even though it only has 8GB of RAM, it's impressively fast. I have installed just about every program that I need to use on a regular basis, and most of them have a memory-resident feature that comes up during startup - but it's not affecting the overall performance to any noticeable degree.Back to a testament to the Wi-Fi operation, I loaded up three drives using Dropbox, OneDrive and Google Drive, and all three feel like it's another partition on the HD the way that it smoothly goes back and forth between drives. Not issues what-so-ever with cloud storage, and a heavy transfer level at that.There's lots of Alienware that comes with the machine, and serious gamers might use it to tweak the settings, but the average user is much more likely to check them out once (if ever) and then move on. I do like the customizable light schemes... and the lights around the box make it look really sexy, but I ended up using the default scheme because there are too many choices to choose from.The size of the keyboard is generously-sized. I don't like not-having an eject button on the DVD drive, because I always think that when I need to, the FN-F4 option has worked every time so far. Having a number pad on a laptop is something I never realized how much I missed. So far I've used it a lot more for spreadsheets than I have for games... but it's an excellent option for those of us who are used to it. If I had a complaint about the keyboard it's that this footprint is a bit large to just throw on your lap and use for a long period typing away. It's just a bit large, but there's not a whole lot more that could have been done without sacrificing screen space, and I wouldn't say I was willing to do that. The battery life is impressive, I've gotten up to 4 hours, but that's also with pretty constant usage. Not sure how long it would last on idle, but there's been no problems with putting to sleep for 12 hours or more without plugging it back in.This is going to seem like nit-picking, but after a lot of use, I find that the places where my wrists rest, are slightly oily on the nice matte finish. I think it all rubs off, but I can see that over time, this will start to show wear. Not sure how much that will bother me down the road. I also find it uncomfortable after a couple of hours when my wrists are laying on the edge of the laptop.But again, I have loaded this up with everything I can throw at it (already filled up 664 GB of the 920 GB available, and not a single media file yet) and it's taking it all like a champ. If you're a gamer and you're throwing everything you have at it - you might be disappointed with the hard drive speed, but that's about it.  If however, you just like a computer that you know that you won't have to upgrade for a while, and you know how to customize a PC to get what you want - you will NOT be disappointed. You will find that this is a very smooth computer (overall) and impressive in a lot of ways. It isn't perfect, but after a LOT of use, I have determined that I do indeed \"love it\" so it gets the 5-star rating. I will continue to put it through a bevy of daily use, and if it fails, the rating will be down-graded, but for now, I really couldn't be happier with this laptop.","rating":5},{"comment":"Wow! What a sleek looking machine this is. It's a thing of beauty with the machined aluminum lid and the carbon fiber base which keeps it cool and lightweight at 6 pounds. I also like that the screen is made of Corning Gorilla glass, since my nickname is \"Grace.\"The 15.6\" LED backlit display  screen is stunning with its 3200x1880 pixel resolution - 5 times the resolution of HD. It makes it great for zooming in on photo\/video editing. It's the best looking screen that I have ever seen on a laptop.The NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M graphics card with 2GB of memory makes movies and videos look sharp and clear and games play fast and smooth on the high settings.The Waves MaxxAudio Pro 5.0 sound system sounds good but I like the Beats Audio system on my HP 17.3\" Pavilion laptop better. Crisper tones with a clear bass. This sound system sounds a bit muffled.I especially like that this laptop has a touch screen. It is so much easier to use than a touchpad or a mouse.It was easy to set up. It took less than 30 minutes to go through the eight steps of the initial set-up and to be up and running and connected to the Internet.This has the 1TB hard drive, which will hold a ton including all my pictures and music. There's also a 32GB solid-state drive. It's a cache drive, which helps make it really fast. It boots up in less than 10 seconds. There's 16GB of RAM and has the Intel i7-4712HQ quad core 2.2Ghz processor.There's an HDMI output if you want to connect it to a larger monitor or your big screen television. It comes with 1 - USB 2.0 port and 3 - USB 3.0 ports. I like that it has a backlit keyboard, which my HP doesn't have.It comes with Dragon Assistant voice recognition software, which I haven't used yet but I will soon because I like using voice recognition technology.The battery seems to last just under four hours.I take videos and like to make home movies on the computer and took 14 videos off of my camera and produced a short movie effortlessly. Again, the quality of video and pictures on the screen is so much better than a regular laptop that it makes editing much more fun.The cons:There's no optical drive for my CDs, movies, programs, or games. I'll have to use a USB drive for them - not as handy. I realize that this computer is extra-thin and an optical drive would have not been feasible but I miss having one at hand.I prefer to use Ethernet for my main computer to connect to the Internet for bill paying and things like that and there is no Ethernet connection on this computer.The major thing I don't like has to do with Windows 8.1 and isn't really a reflection on the laptop. There's a learning curve with 8.1 and I just like Windows 7 more. I guess Windows 8.1 was \"designed for a more responsive touch experience; helps you interact naturally with your content.\"I did find a PDF guide on the Dell website. It's called \"Update Power User Guide for Business.\" That helped familiarize me with some of the 8.1 quirks.I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone looking to upgrade. It is a slick machine.","rating":5},{"comment":"It's pretty obvious when you take this out the box that it is Dell's  answer to the 15\" Apple macbook pro with retina display. Only the XPS 15 sports a higher resolution (3200 x 1800) and a touchscreen display.Looks.It is an attractive 15\" notebook made from high-end materials. The main unit is carved from a solid chunk of aluminum, as is the lid. The base is carbon fiber while inside the clamshell you have a black rubberized surface with illuminated keyboard.The lid sports the highest resolution display currently available. It is a touch screen display that works much like a smartphone screen thus negating the need for a mouse or touchpad (though a touchpad is incorporated below the keyboard).In Use.The notebook has a 32GB SSD incorporated to make use of Intel's fast boot technology. This particular model isn't the top of the line, so it still has a regular mechanical HD which can be a plus since you have 1000gb (terabyte) of storage.It's powered by both an Intel 4600 and Nvidia 750M graphics processor. 2.3 - 3ghz i7 intel processor. This Notepad is pretty fast. It boots quickly to the login screen and the start page is only a password away.Touch screen usability.This is my first touchscreen computer. Both my other systems have Win 8.1 professional installed and I have them boot to desktop because the start screen is a pain with a mouse and gets in the way of productivity.This is not the case with touch screen. it is quite intuitive and the multi-touch screen can track 10 fingers simultaneously. You really do not need a mouse and dragging on the screen is much easier than using a touchpad. By default, the desktop icons have a checkbox, so until you get used to it, you will not activate or drag and clone icons by mistake. A long press produces a rightclick which is useful for context menus.The touch screen works very well, letting me quickly scroll through pages, select items on web pages,  drag and drop files: All the things you would expect plus in many apps you have pinch zoom, pan and rotate much like on a cell phone.Being a graphics person I did try several  pieces of productivity software. 3d studio, Photoshop, MS Office, open source tools like Gimp, some games, etc.I had a few teething problems. The high dpi screen makes the icons and text quite small. But Windows 8.1 has tried to compensate for this by offering DPI scaling options. So apps that use the native widows API can have their user interface scaled naturally from default as much as 250%.I tried several drawing apps, open source and commercial. Almost all of them with one exception worked fine and let me draw with a stylus directly on the screen.Surprisingly Adobe Photoshop was problematic with its custom User interface. It did not scale so text was incredibly tiny. If you upgrade to the latest version, in preferences there is a section called experimental features that has a 200% user interface zoom which scales all the text and icons to a useable level.  Suddenly photoshop is useable and the high resolution means you can fit a lot of detailed images on the screen compared to a standard screen.Unfortunately Adobe didn't consider that people might like to draw on the touchscreen. So they neglected to enable this feature. Instead you can pan, zoom and rotate with your fingers where all other drawing apps let me draw really nicely directly on the screen. (Hopefully this will be addressed later on).3D studio also has a custom UI that does not like high DPI screens, making it quite difficult to work with, even with large icons for large screens.The screen itself is a beautiful vibrant color that gives you good blacks and very bright colors.  It is perhaps the brightest notebook screen I have seen. Which is good because the gorilla glass cover is reflective, but the bright screen overcomes that well. Detail is excellent and despite the small icons and text in some apps, it feels like it strained my eyes less than my large 32\" desktop monitor.The two graphics processors that come with this system easily handle the high resolution with most software without much trouble. The Intel GPU is for general work using little power while the Nvidia 750m caters to high graphics intensive applications competently. The super high resolution display does not make this system ideal for gaming. You will have to choose a lower resolution and allow the image to be scaled to fit the screen. But it will play most games ok at 1600x1200 resolution.With 16GB of system ram and 2gb of DDR5 video ram. There is plenty of memory to run all the applications typically used in a workplace. HD video playback is good.Overall I am very pleased with the notebook.The only fault I have found with it is a little coil whine when dragging the screen when plugged into the AC and the battery is fully charged. Running on battery there is no noise at all. It is completely silent.This is a very nice computer indeed. It looks and feels stylish and has a lot of premium materials used in construction.  It is the nicest laptop I have used and runs windows apps very well.Battery life is enough to last about 3 hours playing HD video with the screen brightness turned up. 6-7 hours doing typical office productivity and web browsing with the balanced power plan which has a less bright screen.All in all, this is a very nice computer and I recommend it.","rating":5},{"comment":"I felt love at first sight and touch with this sleek laptop. Even with its large, gorgeous, high resolution touchscreen the Dell XPS 15 is light and thin enough to hold comfortably in my lap while I&#8217;m curled up on a couch.

If, like me, you prefer the more &#8220;normal&#8221;  old-fashioned desktop you can set it as the default and largely avoid the tiles-only Metro screen that debuted with 8.0.I&#8217;m old school enough to mildly miss having an optical drive for program discs or DVDs, but in actuality I wouldn&#8217;t give up the slenderness of this laptop for the added bulk of a drive. It does mean that all programs must be downloaded, and even with my Fios fiber optics connection that can take a while. When I downloaded Microsoft&#8217;s Silverlight to stream Netflix, I had to go off and putter around elsewhere because it was taking so long--maybe 15-20 minutes--but at least that only has to be done once.There were a few minor glitches at the beginning, like &#8221;helpful&#8221; pop-up tips I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to close and time synch options that didn&#8217;t work correctly--I had to set the time manually--but those issues were resolved in the first few hours and I have enjoyed using this laptop ever since.","rating":5},{"comment":"Other than our disappointment with Windows 8 which seems to be trying and fails to appeal to Apple and Android users, this is the best PC we've ever used.MOJO: The best comparison I can make is with cars.  You could have your choice of five different cars with similar specs, but you know it all comes down to two things--the look and how you feel driving it.  This computer has looks, power, and performance, which is why I say it's the first PC of many I've used which has 'mojo.'LONGEVITY: Sure, I could get technical about the specs, but the fact is that any computer, no matter how souped up it may be the day you buy it, is going to age very quickly.  This computer has enough horsepower and capacity that you wont feel the need to upgrade for a good five years at least, but when you are ready to upgrade you will probably want one with the same features.WINDOWS 8: I'll tuck this in the middle of the review because I feel it has to be written but it doesn't belong at the opening or conclusion of the review.  Windows, from the first version to this latest one, is a great system until you start adding things to your computer.  On Apple, you can keep adding and adding features and it wont effect the function and performance of the computer, but with Windows, the more features you use the more trouble you're asking for.  It's enough to make you want to go back to using DOS.Windows 8 not only completely ignores this historical problem, but adds to it with this new graphic based finder\/desktop\/proxy.  When you're a kid, and you have a lot of toys, you might have like to have all your favorite toys out at once and never put them away.  What Windows 8 does is put out all your toys, plus all your clothes, every color of crayon, and ever Pokemon character out all the time in a bizarre attempt to appeal to any and all possible whims you may have all at once.  Put simply, it's a messy collage of everything you can do with your computer, placed as a proxy for a system which has never been user friendly much less intuitive.Fortunately, you can bypass this mess, use Windows the old fashioned way, and learn to love it like an arranged marriage or the clothes your mother picked out for you.TOUCHSCREEN:  The number one thing I love about this computer is that it has all the power and convenience of a top of the line laptop, and it has a touch screen.  Much as I thought when I first laid hands on myCanon EOS Rebel T4i 18.0 MP Digital SLR with 18-135mm EF-S IS STM Lensand used the first ever touch screen installed on a DSLR, my thought was \"Why haven't all the computer manufacturers done this by now?\"BOTTOM LINE: The combination of a powerful laptop with a touchscreen is something we've all been waiting for even if we didn't know it yet.  Additionally, this computer is a pleasure to use despite Microsoft Windows.If a committed Apple user has to be chained to a PC laptop for work, this is the laptop (s)he will be happy with.","rating":5},{"comment":"When I first opened up the box and plugged it in, I wondered if it would recognize my ATT 4G wireless modem.

But on a brand new computer, Why isn't there a 4G built in modem??**  Now, for me, one of the main differences in a tablet and a laptop is that the laptop is SUPPOSED to offer more performance features.

It's the first upgrade since XP that I think is worth switching to.Vista, well, it had some comparability problems with certain programs and applications but after getting them sorted out it worked OK for me.

My initial impression is that these are made for portable players, as only a small audio cable was included, other headphones I've tried in this price range also included a 1\/4&#34; cable.  The cable connects to the headphone, and is twisted to lock it into place, I thought that was a cool feature.  The headphones don't fold, so the case is fairly large.  It's also thin and a tight fit, so I wouldn't count on it providing much more than organization and scratch protection.The headphones themselves are light, and fit pretty loosely.  I'm about one notch open for adjustment, and I have a fairly average sized male head.  If you have a small head these may be big, if you have a large head these would be ideal. They are pretty comfortable, and do not seal tight, which is good for me, as I find I get a headache from tight headphones.I tried out a few different artists, Richard Thompson, Shakira, Olivia Newton-John and Pink Floyd.  As the description stated they seem to like dance\/pop music the best.  I was able to crank the bass on Shakira and Olivia without too much mudiness.  Pink Floyd also sounded pretty good with average bass or less.  Richard Thompson probably sounded the worst, as he's got a pretty deep voice to begin with, I had to turn the bass down quite a bit.  On the plus side bass adjustments are easy, the dial on the side of the headphones is huge.I liked the remote control as well, it hangs just below the left ear, so it's always easy to find without looking.  It controlled the iPod flawlessly, and it's very intuitive.An excellent set of headphones, I highly recommend them.","rating":5},{"comment":"Our first impression when opening the box was that these looked pretty basic, but after opening them and trying them out, they are anything but basic. They are made of an extremely soft material that is pleasing to the touch and feel on my ears. They are very easy to adjust and don't get my hair caught in them like headphones I've had in the past. Each ear piece pivots a little so that they really do fit comfortably on my ears without smashing them. If you wear earrings, this is especially nice. The headband part that goes around the top of my head is cushioned, so it stays comfortable even after a hours of wearing them. It includes two different cords. The shortest one is about 53&#34; long and includes a volume control on it. The longest cord stretches to 138&#34; long and doesn't have volume controls. It comes with several plug adapters. We've used them with our iphones, tv's, and laptops and they work great with them all. Now to the most important part, the sound is amazing. These aren't your boom boom bass type of headphones. These are more like being in an quiet sound studio and actually being able to hear every instrument along with the musicians voice. I've never really had any like them. I don't mind letting my 8 yo child listen to them because he won't be damaging his ears with all that vibrating bass. They really are amazing and I highly recommend them to anyone looking for quality sound and comfortable headphones.","rating":5},{"comment":"Why surprisingly? Because the way they're marketed, I was expecting absurdly bass-boosted headphones that would wreck the balance of the music like some other brands do. Instead, I got a set that with some sources bested my Sennheiser HD 580s. Here are the relevant bits:Fist of all, construction is exceptional. They're heavy and well-built without being too much to bear on my head. They come with not one but TWO cords: a longer one with a coiled section perfect for use at home (or if you're a DJ), and a shorter straight cord for use with MP3 players and phones. Very thoughtful.The cords themselves are obviously removable (good) but they can be plugged into either ear cup (great). The plugs themselves are extremely high quality and attach by plugging in to the ear cup of choice and then rotating 90 degrees to lock them in (fantastic). No worries about the cord accidentally getting pulled out.Comfort is quite good. Not as plush as my 580s, but I had no problem using them for extended periods of time. Which is something I wanted to do because they sound really, really good.As I mentioned before, there is no absurd bass boost here, despite the marketing. What there is instead is a very smooth, very accurate representation of source material. If your material is bass-heavy, these can handle it no problem, but they aren't going to make The Beatles sound like P Funk - which is a good thing. The low to mid range were not muddy at all, with each instrument easily picked out and not getting lost. Mids were accurate and not accentuated, and the high end was sweet and clear without being harsh.As I said, on some source material I found these preferable to my HD580s which is high praise indeed. In fact, it was only when listening to older jazz material like the Ahmad Jamal Trio recorded live at the Pershing in 1959 where I found myself wanting to return to my Sennheisers, which delivered more air and a wider sound stage, feeling almost like I wasn't wearing headphones.But I was extremely impressed otherwise. These are beautifully built, well though-out, come with multiple cables and a nice carrying case, are efficient enough to be driven by an MP3 player but work great with a stereo (they come with a mini-to-1\/4&#34; adapter as well) and sound fantastic. If you had asked me if I thought Pioneer would pull of a trick like this I would have said &#34;not a chance - they'll be bassy and muddy&#34; - but I would have been very, very wrong.Great job Pioneer. Really.","rating":5},{"comment":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I received the Pioneer SE-MX9-K Headphones. Nowadays most headphones are either smaller with noise cancelling technology, or very small earbuds.  The Pioneer SE-MX9-K Headphones are a throwback to few decades ago when large \"cans\" where what you wanted if you liked your music loud with a lot of bass.Out of the box, the headphones are a little on the heavy side and very well made. It comes with various cables and connectors for use with just about every device. The main coiled cord is on the short side, and an ugly red and black color that don't really match the all black headphones at all. My only guess is that they're trying to look similar to \"Beats\".On my head, they fit comfortably despite the large size and weight. Pioneer seems to gear these headphones mostly to DJ's and for dance music, so the first thing I listened to was classic EDM by Deadmau5. If you're looking for loud volumes and booming bass, they do not disappoint. They brought back a lot of memories of when I was younger and I'd blast my brains out with a giants pair of \"cans\" on my head. I also toned it down a bit and listened to some rock, classical, and new age music at lower volumes. While they still performed well, it was clear these are designed for heavy bass and louder volumes. The highs are there, but mid-tone seemed to be lacking a little. Audiophiles would probably be disappointed.If you're looking for an old fashioned pair of bass booming headphones, I definitely recommend the Pioneer SE-MX9-K Headphones. They produce excellent bass at high volumes without any distortion. If you're looking for an everyday pair of headphones for lower volumes and soft styles of music, they may not be the best choice. You can do better for less money.","rating":4},{"comment":"I actually received the ear plug ones and not this one. I was disappointed about getting the wrong product, however the ear plugs are very clear and lightweight.Great sound.","rating":5},{"comment":"I am not an audiophile.  I am just you're average, everyday music listener.  I do know the difference between good sounding electronics and bad sounding electronics, but not down to the components that make up the item or the hertz or whatever the technical stuff is.  Bottom line:  this is the best pair of headphones I've ever had.  Truth be told, the most I've ever spent on headphones prior was $40.Compared to some headphones, these may seem a little big, but they are comfortable.  They come with a canvas carrying case to keep them protected.  The cord comes off and attaches on so you don't just wrap it around the headphones and get it all tangled.  Although I think that would be tough because the cord is very durable.  There is a volume control button on the cord which is great if you use it with a portable device you would put in your pocket.Pioneer states that these are best for dance music, though I found that they are good for a wide variety of musical styles.  There is a bass adjustment knob on the side of one of the ear pieces.  I have never seen a feature like this before. You can add more or less bass to your liking.","rating":5},{"comment":"I've got some pretty nice headphones, but thesePioneer SE-MX9-K Headphonesblew me away! I haven't heard sound like this is decades!  Just one drawback - they aren't Bluetooth, so you'll have to actually plug these in to your device.  Never mind, they are cute as can be.All I can say is WOW","rating":5},{"comment":"Both my dad and I are hearing impaired.  He damaged his right ear from working on airplane engines while in the Air Force and I had numerous ear infections in my left ear when I was a child.  When we watch a film, the English Subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired (SDH) are always turned on.  Unfortunately, not all films have subtitles.  Dad and I both have iOS devices.  He has an iPad and I have an iPhone.  We prefer to wear headphones rather than ear buds when we watch films on them.The Pioneer SE-MX9-K Headphones are far superior to the inexpensive headphones that we've purchased from the discount stores.  They fit more comfortably over our ears and don't sweat as much.  However, they are heavier.  This is a small price to pay for their high quality sound.  I can watch a movie on my iPhone and understand practically every word that is said.  Also, the noise cancellation is excellent.  I like to watch films while relaxing at Panera Bread.  There is always a constant din of noise.  Fortunately, I am able to tune it out.  The headphones make this extremely easy.  When I am wearing them, the rest of the world simply goes away, leaving me in peace.I have been able to successfully connect my Pioneer Headphones to my VIZIO HDTV, my HP Pavilion TouchSmart 14-inch Sleekbook (with Windows 8.1 installed), and my Dynex Portable DVD player.  The sound, as with my iPhone 4, has always been great on all of them.  A nice, much appreciated, added touch is the strong, sturdy carrying case that came with the headphones.  Now I don't have to buy one separately.  I have received many expensive pieces of electronics that didn't have carrying cases.  The case will make it very easy for me when I carry my headphones on vacation.Though they are a bit bulky, and I sometimes feel, while I am sitting at a table in Panera Bread, that people are staring at me, I don't care.  My ability to hear like a normal person more than makes up for my strange or odd appearance.  Furthermore, I have the type of hearing loss that hearing aids are not going to help much because it consists primarily of nerve damage.After wearing my Pioneer SE-MX9-K Headphones, Indigo Black, my dad also wants one for himself.  I already bought my dad a portable grill for Father's Day.  However, I told my brother to buy Dad the Pioneer SE-MX9-S Headphones, Bright Silver (Pioneer SE-MX9-S Headphones, Bright Silver), since it was still in stock at the time of this review.  I highly recommend the Pioneer Headphones for those, like myself, who are hearing impaired.  They are definitely worth the extra cost.I would also like to add that the Pioneer Headphones are far better than any wireless pair of headphones I've purchased.  Reception is always poor with them.  Several years ago, I bought Dad wireless headphones for Father's Day.  They were horrible.  Because I had lost the receipt, I donated them to a thrift store.Joseph B. Hoyos","rating":5},{"comment":"Pioneer SE-MX9-K Headphones, Indigo BlackI recently received these Pioneer headphones to evaluate. I am going to compare them to my Monster Beats Pro. They are of similar price and size and features. The first thing I noticed is when putting them on, they don&#8217;t want to crush my head like the Beats. I like that! I have a large noggin and as nice as the Beats sound they hurt my head. The main thing I noticed was as expected the Beats really like to deliver the bass. Duh. Still, the Pioneer is no slouch. I ran my song gauntlet at the both of them including Ant Music by Adam Ant, Rolling in the Deep, by Adele and Time to Say Goodbye, by Andrea Bocelli. An eclectic mix but for me useful to get a reasonable spectrum of sounds. The sounds stage on the Pioneer was wide and full. I got that presence feeling that is so wonderful with big &#8220;Cans&#8221; that you don&#8217;t usually get with ear buds.The Pioneer is very comfortable on my big head and the ear muffs feel really nice too. They have good adjustability and are mostly of a metal construction so they seem pretty durable. The ear muffs fold 90 degrees sideways so they can fit flatter in the included carry pouch. You also get in addition to the regular partially coiled cord a straight cord with a mic and control buttons to work with either and iOS or Android smartphone. You also get a &#8221; adapter for a big receiver and a double prong adapter for some airplanes. Overall a very nice kit.I think the Pioneer headphones held their own against the Beats Pro, actually sounding better on some of my test songs. They cost about one hundred dollars less and are lighter and more comfortable to wear. I really like them and will use them as my new reference &#8220;can&#8221; type headphones.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is the first thing that I've ever owned that was manufactured by Pioneer.  I've always heard that their products are great and I've also &#34;heard&#34; their products in use and I tend to agree with the opinion that they make excellent products.  When offered these SE-MX9-K headphones, I jumped at the chance to try them out.I was not disappointed at all.  The sound quality is excellent, allowing me to hear nuances and noises that I didn't even know were part of a lot of the music I listen to.  The sound is rich, bass is bottom heavy, and the treble is pleasing to the ear.The headphones are built with the iPhone and iPhone products in mind, but I connected it to my Android phone to listen.  While I lost a couple of the features, the quality is still there.Options and features include smartphone volume control of the unit, two cords (one long and coiled, the other straight) to connect to the device, multiple plugs to attach to different types of sources, cord connections on both the left and right earpad (including plugs for the side you do not use), a carrying case for the headphones and all of the accessories, and comfortable, adjustable earpads.I cannot stress how wonderful the sound quality is on these headphones.  Pitched as optimized toward dance music and &#34;club sound,&#34; I listened to a little techno, a little workout music, and some hip-hop, to get the feel for the &#34;club sound.&#34;  In my opinion, they nailed this optimization.  However, these headphones work just as well with hard rock, heavy metal, and prog rock (which is more to my liking).  For instance, songs by bands like Sepultura, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, Styx, and Iron Maiden sounded much better on these headphones than they do on other similar devices.Overall, I highly recommend these headphones.  They offer crisp, excellent sound, and are loaded with nice features like the volume control and option to connect to either earpad.  Plus, they come with some great accessories.Get them!","rating":5},{"comment":"We've gone through many headphones in the past few years.  I have to say the sound that come out of these are phenomenal.  You really have to watch your volume with these.  The cushions are very soft, but as with any over the ear phones, they do tend to bother you after a while, but that's with prolonged use.  It comes with a short & long USB wire to plug in. Definitely worth the money if you're unsure of quality.  The packaging was secure.  It also comes with a zipper bag for storage.","rating":5},{"comment":"High-end headphones reviews are often highly subjective.  Below, I have described these headphones while comparing them to my current headphones theSOL REPUBLIC Tracks HD($70) and the wildly popular and similarly pricedBeats Studio($299).*** Size, Style and Comfort ***From the photos, you can see that these headphones have been modeled extensively on the Beats Studio.  They have an adjustable headband with matte finish and modern, recognizable round cans.  The seams in the plastic casing material are fairly visible and the matte coating can scratch easily.  For example, the tie wraps that held the headphones into the packaging lightly scratched the headbands before I could even get them out of the box.In terms of comfort, I have a fairly small skull (female: 5-feet tall) and even at the shortest setting, they hung a little low on my ears.  After unboxing, I immediately wore the headphones outdoors on a 60-minute walk.  The sound of road traffic was fairly well suppressed, but the lack of good fit over my ears hindered the noise cancellation a bit.  The nylon material over the ear cups is soft and doesn't cause my ears to sweat excessively compared to other on-ear headphones.  However, the weight of the headphones did become a bit bothersome after 20-30 minutes.Personally, I find these headphones to be much more stylish than either the SOL Tracks or the Beats Studio headphones.  As a petite female, I don't like looking like a space cadet and the Pioneers are much less ostentatious than other big headphones.  They do however sport the ubiquitous black\/red cable which gives the \"look\" of wearing Beats (if you're going for that look).*** Functionality, Ease of Use ***My first test was with my iPod Nano and a 60-minute outdoor walk\/jog.  Since I use my headphones most heavily during workouts, this is always my first trial.  I had trouble with the fit of the headband (these are designed for larger skulls than mine, apparently) which caused them to shimmy back on my head as I jogged.Also, the audio cable connects in such a way as to protrude from the bottom of the ear can a good two inches. As a result, the stiff audio cable constantly snagged on my shoulder as I walked, ran or looked around.  If I were lifting weights at the time, this would have driven me crazy and interfered with my head\/neck mobility.Another design issue I had was the placement of the audio controls.  The volume + \/ - , home button and microphone are located on the audio cable just below the ear.  This makes it awkward to reach your volume controls, especially given that most of us are \"trained\" from Apple headphones, etc... to reach at our upper chest level to access audio controls.*** Sound Quality ***I consider the sound quality to be practically identical to my SOL Tracks headphones.  The bass is deep and rich with great detail and clarity.  I used these headphones on my Yamaha professional electric grand piano to experience the depth of tones from the lowest octaves to the higher pitches, using multiple voices.  I also plugged these into my Fender Rumble 15 bass amplifier and played my Fender Jazz Bass through them.  In both cases, the audio experience was wonderful and I was quite pleased.However, a proper fit over your ears is essential to experience the audio mix.  These headphones really don't fit as well as my SOL Tracks.  And, when worn properly the audio quality is not noticeably superior to the SOL's.Compared to the Beats Studio, I consider the Pioneer headphones superior. The Beats, in my opinion, favor bass too heavily which flattens the mids and trebles in my ear.  As I said though, headphones are a very subjective subject!*** Technical Specifications ***Frequency Response: 6 Hz to 40,000 HzImpedance: 32 OhmsSensitivity 106 dBDriver Units: 50 mmPlug: 3.5 mm (stereo mini)Cable Length: 1.2 metersWeight: 305g (heavier than SOL Tracks and Beats Studio);*** Accessories Included ***Carrying Pouch** According to the documentation: a stereo mini to \" adapter was supposed to be included.  In addition a 2.0 meter length coiled cable was supposed to be included.  However, neither of these items were boxed with my headphones **Overall, I would say these are outstanding in sound quality but lacking in their overall design.  I prefer the price, weight and adjustability of my SOL Tracks and the fact that they essentially produce the same fabulous sound.Compared to Beats Studio, I prefer these Pioneers due to their richer and fuller mix.  I like the on-ear bass adjustability and slightly-smaller casing of the Pioneers.You most certainly can't go wrong with these.  But, in my opinion, they don't boldly stand out among the overcrowded selection of ~ $300 headphones.","rating":4},{"comment":"Despite the price, these are still excellent headphones. Even if I get them free I cannot give them 5 stars than most given my experience with the Sennheiser HD-280 PRO Headphones.Look them up, they are less than 1\/3 of the price of these ones, and virtually just as good if not slightly better sounding. (though that might be because I've had mine for a while and are well broke in).Anyway, lets break it down:Pros:- Great quality (the quality of the outers materials (plastic housing, ear muffs, chord) is a step above the sennheiser mentioned above)- Cups your ear well, and the sound if you have a good audio source is excellent. You can certainly notice it going from $40 headphones \/ earbuds to these ones.- Stylish\/cool. Both the headband and the ear muffs outer area look very good. So not only are the materials good quality, but they also look very good to boot.Neutral:- They haven't been bass boosted. If you prefer bass, use beats headphones. I much prefer these than the over inflated bass.- Adjustable headband (most headphones have this.. even $20 ones) but since it wasn't clear from the picture I figure I would add it here)Cons:- Price. To be worth that much over the sennheiser I expected a little more. So they lose one star based on this.Overall you are getting a great sounding piece of equipment, that looks excellent, and you will enjoy for many, many years. I'd personally recommend the Sennheiser over these, (due to price and near identical sound quality) but since these are more stylish, and the materials look a little better, then I can see someone willing to spend the extra money on these.If the ever get closer to the 150 price range, they might be worth 5 stars, but at the current 220-300 price range, it's a bit too much more than comparable headphones.","rating":4},{"comment":"I have always been a big fan of Pioneer electronics, with receivers and headphones both being products I have owned in the past. I received a pair of SE-MX7-K headphones for review and I have to admit that they produce some killer sound with very little of the other type of sound you don't want - whether it be fuzzy background buzz or clicks or drones or what-not. These headphones are great and I would definitely recommend them to anyone who is looking for a super pair of headphones. Yes, they are quite expensive, so if you really want them, you are going to have to spend a lot, but you aren't likely to find anything much better than these.","rating":5},{"comment":"...or the comfort...First off, the product presentation on these is extraordinary. They come packed in a beautiful package, with a detachable cord (what a GREAT feature) and a carrying case (which this reviewer found too small to carry the headphones without detaching the cord... a minor annoyance). The stop start button, microphone and volume control on the cord will delight those with an iPhone or iPad or Android phone or tablet.Listening to a variety of musical styles on this set of headphones makes you realize why Pioneer claims they are  a line of high quality headphones optimized for listening to dance music.&#34; Folk, classical, jazz... Not here, folks. They'll work okay, but you will constantly be fidgeting with the bass control to get the right amount of bass. Folk needed one setting that worked okay. Rock and Dance and Hip Hop and Pop all sounded just fine at another, and the fact that you can adjust the bass on these is simply wonderful. That feature will be really great if you listen in a lot of different situations, noise-wise (I'm talking to you, metro commuters).In this reviewer's opinion, the treble is week no matter how you set it. Classical and jazz? Forget it. If you're into those styles of music, these are the wrong headphones to get, and Pioneer probably knows this, so I did NOT ding my review for that shortcoming.Comfortable? No. Sorry. No. They aren't horrible, but they are the most uncomfortable pair of phones this reviewer remembers using. The cups don't surround the whole ear and feel like they're pressing too hard. They don't hurt, but you never forget you're wearing headphones.But you aren't buying these because of sound or comfort. This set of headphones is a $200.00 fashion accessory anyway. They look like &#34;beats&#34;, they probably sound like them. If that's what you're after, this is a 5-star product... except...200 dollars for these? Give me a break. I can't in good conscience give them 5 or even 4 stars due to that. For about half of that, you could have the excellent sounding Sennheiser HD 280 or 380 or AKG K240, both the kind of headphones a professional recording engineer (not a DJ) would find themselves using (I personally own a set of K240s and the HD 280). But those headphones don't look look stylish and they don't have unnaturally strong bass (with the capability to boost it even more.. If you want those things, these headphones will make you happy. And again, if most of your listening is current dance\/pop\/rock\/hip-hop, there is no reason to think that these won't work great for your purposes.Please note: I am reviewing the SE-MX7-K, and not the SE-MX9-K, since the 7 is the unit that Amazon sent me as a vine reviewer. We Vine reviewers are required to review the products we are sent to remain active in the program, So I MUST post a review here... but I will copy this review to the proper page as well. I'm certain the MX9 is very very similar, and will excel in the same areas that the MX7 did.","rating":3},{"comment":"Wearing the headphones is very comfortable as there are cushions on the contact points.  The headphones seem sturdy enough and look like they can take a little mishandling from a toddler, but considering they have a lot of plastic to them, I wouldn't consider them to be particularly any more durable than other headphones (or probably just a little more durable at most).  Although there isn't anything that feels cheap about them, I plan to keep them out of my toddler's reach to prevent him from destroying them (like he did with another set of headphones I had).The volume on the headphones seems lower than my regular speakers, so I have to turn up the volume when using the headphones.  The sound is excellent and from what I can tell, and I am not sure if it could be any better.I like how the set comes with many plugs, many of which I haven't used in years.  The packaging of the headphones is the most high quality I have ever seen and is truly impressive.","rating":5},{"comment":"Just received my set of Pioneer SE-MX9-K Headphones (May 22, 2014) Of course I immediately opened up the box to try them out.

I always use headphones so as not to disturb my husband and because they tend to cut me off from distractions. That said, I need a good set of headphones. I put on various kinds of music to test out the Pioneer headset and WOW wee wow wow, the sound, base and sharpness are outstanding! They worked great with my computer and tablet. They are comfortable to wear and appear very durable. In fact, I am using them now as I am writing this review.

But for the quality as well as the brand trust, the price is reasonable.My first thought when removing them out of the packaging was that they felt rugged.

It's clear, crisp audio that provides rich bass without killing your eardrums.I tend to have sensitive ears when it comes to headphones, and only after wearing them for more than about two hours do my ears begin to ache. With some other headphones it happens after not even a half hour.If you've had experience with Pioneer in the past,  you know the brand delivers, and these pair of headphones are no exception. If you can afford the price tag and are looking for a high end pair of headphones, definitely put these on the top of your list.","rating":4},{"comment":"I've had a number of Pioneer products over the years and have come to expect quality from the brand.

The PIONEER SE-MX9-K DJ headphones deliver smooth, deep bass, without any boom, or unnatural sound repoduction.STYLINGThey look great, with simple lines, chic black styling-- understated, and classy. These headphone cans rotate 90 degrees to the side, for monitoring your line feed, while still listening to the house mix.  As for comfort, they are far and away the most comfortable headphones I've worn.  The padding on the headband isn't only placed around the top, but all the way around to the ear pieces. That way, the cushioned weight is distributed across the entire skull.  There are thick pads around the earpiece as well, which not only helps to isolate the headphone's soundscape from outside noise, but also deepens the bass attack.  Not to mention providing even MORE comfort. These headphones come with nice amenities, including a nylon storage bag, a gold plated 1\/4 inch male to 1\/8 inch female adapter for your headphone jack, a splitter that lets you move from a 1\/8 inch stereo female adapter, to two 1\/8 inch male plugs, an option that lets you chose which headphone can you want the cord to come out of, right or left side, and an option for which type of cord you want to use: a shorter chord with a mute button, designed for listening to music on your iPhone, or a longer 12 foot cord, that plugs into your home stereo system, or headphone monitor jack. The 12 foot cord combines curled up wire by the plug, with straight wire near the headphones, so you'll have plenty of room to move away from your sound source.  Its a pet peeve of mine, to get headphones that I cant use, because they either come with the mute button that only lets me use them with iPhones, or they come with headphone cords that are too short to reach from the stereo to my chair.  Plus, since my stereo only has 1\/4 headphone jacks, I can use these without buying a special 1\/4 inch to 1\/8 inch adapter as well.  So there are plenty of options to tailor these headphones to whatever system you own, or whichever way to want to use  them, left or right handed style.SOUNDI compared the PIONEER headphones to two different high end headphones, the SONY MDR-XB600, and PHILIPS Citiscape DOWNTOWN Headphones.  Well, these blow the PHILIPS headphones out of the water.  Its not even fair to compare them. However, these headphones are in the same ballpark as the SONYs that I have.  Both are designed for DJ-ing, both have deep bottom end sounds, etc.  Overall, I'd have to side with the PIONEER over the SONY.  The bottom end is just a little more realistic, and smooth, with the PIONEERs.  I own Jensen home speakers, with 15 inch woofers.  I listened to some THIEVERY CORPERATION (dance and reggae music) over the PIONEER headphones, and then took the headphones off to listen to the same music over loudspeakers with 15 inch woofers.  Honestly, there wasn't much difference between the two. To me,  these headphones sound like I strapped 15 inch woofers to my ears.  Also, they sound smooth across the audio spectrum, from treble to bass.  I heard a great deal of audio clarity and definition as well, tho the SONYs delivered in this area just as much.DECISIONS, DECISIONSSo which headphones will you chose?  Assuming that price is not a factor, I really like the little extra bells and whistles that PIONEER provides their customers.  Having all the options with which cords or plugs to use, or which side of the head the wire emerges from, can make a lot of difference, for how well these conform to your needs.  I like the styling, also important since you'll be wearing these as a fashion statement, just as you do with sunglasses.  Most importantly, if you like a DEEP bass, like what you'd experience from 15 inch woofers, then you're sure to like these PIONEER headphones.","rating":5},{"comment":"THE SHORT STORYInstallation consists on pushing the HDD in and screwing little near-microscopic screws using the little screwdriver provided. It's all done in less than 5 minutes but you need good eyes and a steady hand because the little screws are VERY small.The HDD, once in the enclosure, connects to the computer via a (provided) USB 3.0 wire which powers it. It's immediately recognized by Windows 7 or 8 or your PS3 and you are ready to use it. Recommended.End of short story.SPECSYou get the following:- The aluminum enclosure with the circuitry to the USB interface. It's important for the case to be 'metal' because metal helps dissipate the heat, unlike 'plastic' which would trap it inside.- 4 little screws (them being so small, it would be good to have an extra just in case).- A screwdriver for the little screws.- A nice USB 3.0 interface cable.- Some low-grade plastic-rubber or rubberized plastic protective sleeve which you are not likely to use.- A little English\/Spanish\/French manual that includes the an easy to follow 5-step installation guide.RATINGI like it because the price is right and it meets my expectations of keeping HDDs I rip off old laptops or gaming machines safe and accessible through a fast interface.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a super attractive, very slim brushed aluminum case.

Please it in the middle of the drive (or somewhere else suitable) and then seal the case and secure it with the screws.

The box Supports Standard Notebook 2.5&#34; SATA and SATA II hard drives, and is backwards compatible with USB 2.0 or 1.1. If your computer has a 3.0 port, you&#8217;ll be able to reach speeds of up to 5 Gbps&#8230;480 Mbps if you use USB 2.0.This premium enclosure is one of three colors rather than the black: gold, red, or blue. All look to be bright and glossy with a &#8220;brushed&#8221; look, giving it a very pretty, burnished appearance.Once joined with your hard drive, you&#8217;ll get the ability to download information without setup screens, drivers, or any other add-ons &#8211; just a &#8220;plug and play&#8221; case to facilitate data transfer, and indicator lights to provide you with power and activity status. (Though you may need to format your hard drive if it is brand new.)While this is a &#8220;no frills&#8221; setup, Sabrent has done a good job providing you with what you&#8217;ll need other than your own hard drive. Besides the enclosure, what you receive in the box is four screws (you will need all of them), a cord, a small screwdriver (though I did not get one with this case), a carrying pouch, and a User&#8217;s Guide. The box has a top half and a bottom half, and the assembly really is no muss, no fuss. About the only problem is the ridiculously small screws involved: my fingers make a hash of working with things this small, and between the screws taking a life of their own as they slide out of my grip, and my inability to even get them to even point the right way, I can only say it&#8217;s great that they supply you with four rather than only the two you&#8217;ll need. But once that problem is out of the way, you&#8217;ll find the connection really is plug-and-play&#8230;there&#8217;s not even a need to re-boot your computer.As the product specs say, the enclosure allows for heat dissipation that might encumber data backup. While it supplies you with what is, in essence, a carrying enclosure, this is not really one that would protect it from a rough-and-tumble trek&#8230;say, a plane trip. For your home, however, and routine work, it will more than do the job.Note: the box of my Premium case did not list screws (or a screwdriver) in its own list of features that are inside the box, even though they are included...the screws were, not the screwdriver.NOTE: I was supplied this product free of charge with no other conditions other than my writing a fair and honest review -- which this is.","rating":5},{"comment":"This compact hard drive enclosure is made of aluminum and extremely strong and durable. It's so strong that I doubt you can break it without a hammer or similar type of tool. I'm not saying that if you were to drop it that your hard drive would remain undamaged. It may or may not protect it because the jarring is likely what would damage the hard drive. This enclosure doesn't really protect from falls like that because there is no impact reducing features in this enclosure. However few enclosures would protect from that type of fall.These come in multiple colors Black, Blue, Gold and Red. I choose the Blue and I like it even better that it's pictured. In the picture it showed as being darker blue but it's more of an Aqua color that I like even better. This aluminum enclosure comes with  a USB cable, screws, screwdriver, user guide and a nice black pouch to store the enclosure in. It holds 2.5 SATA hard drive and it installs very easily. Simply open the enclosure, slide the hard drive into place. Be sure to utilize the piece of foam that is included to hard the hard drive securely in place. Then close it up and tighten the four included screws. After that it's plug and play. Plug it in and it will be operating within seconds. I am using it on a Windows 8.1 gaming laptop and it works great. It utilizes USB 3.0 technology so accessing or transferring files is very fast. If your computer still uses USB 2.0 or 1.1 then that's not a problem. It's backward compatible and will still work, it will just be slower. It has a LED light on the front that will illuminate when running and will tell you when the hard drive is reading or writing.There are a lot of hard drive enclosures on the market of which I have only tried a few.

All devices basically do the same thing. So I look for the following....---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Review starts here...---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1. Legacy support.  This enclosure works fine with USB 2.0 as well as the much newer USB 3.0.2. Price quality balance.  This enclosure strikes a nice balance between totally generic no support and going to Best Buy and spending 3x the price for an enclosure meets the exact same spec.3. Flexibility & quality: Run sata OR SSD drive that fits your current budget and needs.  When you need a bigger \/faster drive retire the drive to an old laptop and replace it with a new drive.  When you purchase a retail hard drive that is meant to go inside a laptop computer is is going to be faster and better quality than a dedicated all in on solution - like buying a sealed enclosure that already comes with a hard drive.  ********Guess where the slowest, cheapest, most failure prone hard drives end up? DEDICATED SEALED DRIVE ENCLOSURES with an expensive brand name on them! I know I have remplaced many drives for my customers & at work in the office.**********4. Life span - I'm still using external drive enclosures from 10 years ago!  But now FAST affordable USB 3.0 is finally here so I can retire those enclosures to the thrift store to help others and upgrade to USB 3.0!I built my computer 4 years ago and it only has USB 2 and eSata not USB 3.0.  The drive ran fine but only achieved 32MB\/second transfer rate.  So I bought and installed a 4 port USB 3.0 PCI-E card so I could realzied the full speed of an older 80GB SATA 2.5\" drive which turned ot to be about 45MB\/second... 30% faster.  As the price drops on SSD I will upgrade to that later on.TIP:***NEVER store the ONLY copy of data on ANY external drive.  They are meant as a BACKUP ONLY.  One fall while the drive is running and the data will be lost forever.Recommend:Buy without fear, comes with everything you need - screws, screw driver, carrying case, USB 3.0 cable (on the drive end) but a normal USB 2.0 cable on the computer end so it works in ANY computer made in the last 15+ years.Remember, YOU must supply the hard drive as that is NOT included.","rating":4},{"comment":"The EC-RA25 and EC-ALBL hard drive enclosures look the same and cost the same, but are surprisingly different.  So, I thought it would be useful to compare them.Both enclosures are slim and made of attractive aluminum.  They include a little sleeve to protect the paint, which could be easily scratched.  However, the metal itself is not prone to denting.The big difference between the two is illustrated in the video.  The EC-RA25 has a design that I am more familiar with - two screws hold it in place and the hard drive caddy slides in and out.  The EC-ALBL instead has four screws to attach the top and bottom halves.  While this is a bit more effort when switching drives, it also lends stability.  There is also less opportunity for the little screws to vibrate out, which can happen in a backpack over time.In terms of speed, both checked out to be nearly identical, which is to say fast.  Not quite as fast as possible with some chipsets, but they definitely take advantage of USB 3.0.Overall, both are great drives and will likely serve your needs.  For a bit of extra security, I would suggest the EC-ALBL.Thank you to Sabrent for the review units.  Thank you to Gramatik for the music.","rating":5},{"comment":"I've used a few hard drive enclosures and this is the first that requires screws. That makes it a more permanent enclosure than others. That's okay. I'm using it for an old 2.5\" hard drive that I need to turn into an external hard drive. It works well. I backed up all my photos from my Windows 7 computer onto it, and all went smoothly.The enclosure comes with the necessary cable and a pouch. It's polished and attractive. I like it, but I don't think it would be good for someone who needs to constantly swap hard drives out. The screws make that inconvenient.This product was provided for review by Sabrent.","rating":4},{"comment":"A nice-looking 2.5\" clam-shell drive case. Performance is decent, it's barely larger than the HDD it's meant to contain, and no AC adapter is necessary.The aluminum shell has the look of woodgrain (the texture also helps hide smudges) and the metal helps dissipate heat, feeling mildly warm to the touch after use. A fitted carry-pouch, heavy-duty USB3 cable, and mini-screwdriver (with miniature screws) are included. A single blue LED serves as both power and activity light.A small foam block goes inside the case to make sure slim drives (such as 7mm SSD) don't rattle. An OCZ Vertex SSD fit inside without drama, and performance testing showed sustained writes of 125MB\/s, respectably close to the speed I'd get from a powered USB3 dock. The self-powered USB controller (meaning it draws power from the USB connection, rather than an AC adapter) is not holding this case back. Testing was on a Macbook Pro.During many years of IT work, I've used a lot of poorly made HDD enclosures. It's nice to find this one is well-engineered. Everything is the right size, the halves of the case close cleanly without having to \"try\", the screw-holes are machined correctly.Only complaints: the little blue LED is hard to see; a larger LED, or sticking the LED on the outside of the case would have helped. The miniature screws and mini screw-driver aren't a size I normally carry with me. IT would be nice if the case used slightly larger screws (that would work with a normal sized screwdriver) for convenience when on the go.Enthusiasts and professional both know this kind of case is invaluable. It's always cheaper to \"roll your own\" external hard drives (buy a case and buy a drive), and there are lots of times when it's easiest to just attach a drive to another machine to move data, do backups, migrate and upgrade. If you need a 2.5\" SATA case, this is a decent one.[ A sample was provided to me for review. ]Recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"This enclosure is designed to allow you to turn any spare hard drive (or solid state drive) into an external hard drive. In that, this enclosure functions well and as you expect.The issues I have are:1) the enclosure opens horizontally. The edges of the aluminum case feel a little harsh. I was actually wondering if it might be possible to slice a finger on the edge.2) despite coming with a sleeve for travel, the case isn't really designed to be travel ready. There is no motion dampening in place to prevent drive damage and so on. What you see in the pictures is what you get, there is nothing inside the enclosure except a small piece of foam.Other than those two issues, this enclosure works as described and works well. I've been using it for about a week, copying data to and from the drive I've put inside without any issue. I just don't travel with the drive or enclosure and never will based on it's design.If you are looking for a decent enclosure that works, I would first recommend the Sabrent EC-RA25 enclosure over this one if for no other reason than the safety of your fingers. If that's unavailable, and you still want a Sabrent enclosure, this one works just as well as the other in terms of performance, etc.Recommended, with the caveats above.I received a free sample for review purposes.","rating":4},{"comment":"Things keep getting simpler. Thank goodness, because this is the first router I've come across that I can actually recommend to someone who has no IT background. Such a person, would not be able to use all the features of the router (DDNS, MAC addresses, IPs, etc.) but they would be able to set it up and getting it going without forcing me to come over and do it for them. In time, as the person learns and is so inclined, they can use more if not all of the features.A little IT know-how is useful however. Let's say the newbie users gets all set up and then wants to play with subnet addressing. They change their subnet. Unless they know to point their browser at the new default gateway address, they will get stuck until they figure it out. But I think that the user interface does a good amount of hand-holding so don't worry about it.In addition to the normal spectrum of router abilities, it also does website category filtering and it allows you to police the hours of particular users. Don't want the kids to be online at certain times? No problem. The router will let you take care of that.Thumbs Up:Very easy to set up even for complete novices.Browser-based user interface is simple, as opposed to confusing.Thumbs Down:Lack of gigabit ethernet ports. Has 10\/100 ethernet ports.It doesn't let me select my preferred DNS provider. I'm sure a call to tech support would solve that, but I don't like having to call for stuff like that.Not having gigabit ethernet ports will only limit how fast you can transfer between a wired and wireless device. Most data transfer done by my wireless devices is to the Internet, so the ethernet ports never come into play. If you are like me in that respect, this is a \"buy\". If you anticipate transferring large files between wireless and wired devices, get a router with gigabit ethernet ports.But for that one thing, this is a good router.","rating":4},{"comment":"The Belkin AC1200 (F9K1123) is a nice basic router for home or office use, with an impressively simple user interface and setup process. It uses the new Wireless-AC standard to provide faster throughput on the 5GHz band; devices that need the better range available on the 2.4GHz band are still limited to lower speeds.The form factor, which is shared with a number of Belkin'solder routers, is a little bit strange and not space-efficient; it only stands stably in a vertical position, is larger than it needs to be with a lot of dead space taken up by its plastic foot, and doesn't have many useful diagnostic LEDs. But it does seem well-ventilated and stable, if not sturdy. Four gigabit Ethernet ports are supplied along with a USB port that can be used to attach a storage device. (Note that some of Belkin's other AC1200 models are listed as having two USB ports; the F9K1123 model only has one.)Setup is easy and seamless; the router's web control panel is one of the very best ones I've seen, with a streamlined design and clear documentation that make it clear what settings you need to pay attention to and which ones are \"advanced\" or unimportant. All the basic settings are there and clearly marked, and there's also parental control\/blocking, very basic DLNA media streaming from the router's USB port, and even basic QoS under the name \"Intellistream\" (though I've found this to be buggy on past Belkin routers). Initial setup takes around five minutes; the router is password-secured by default, and the initial password is recorded on a card that you can store permanently in its plastic foot, a nice touch.  And for some reason, the first step you'll want to perform out of the box -- changing its wireless SSIDs and passwords -- takes two steps, two setup screens, and two full restarts of the wireless router, rather than just one as it should.Buyers should be aware that the router can also supply an open, unsecured \"guest\" network, which is a nice optional feature -- but this feature is switched on by default, a very poor security practice; most users should turn it off immediately.This router uses a Broadcom chipset, which might be able to support the feature-rich DD-WRT open-source firmware in the future, if the project's developers are able to add it -- this hasn't been done for many past generations of Belkin hardware, though. Buyers looking for DD-WRT support should probably look for hardware from manufacturers like TP-Link orNetgear, with a stronger track record of running the custom firmware. Anyhow, most basic home and office users should be happier sticking with Belkin's far user-friendlier interface.It probably isn't worth the cost to upgrade from a Wireless-N router at this point; even with still-scarce AC-capable hardware (which also has to be positioned quite near the router, since the low-range 5GHz band is the only one improved by the AC network) I experienced no real improvement in speed over a good N router likeTP-Link's WDR4300, whose hardware design and external antennas provide better range.  But performance has been good for me so far, with no instability or problems; so the AC1200 seems like a basically solid choice, though it is one among many in a crowded market for wireless routers.","rating":4},{"comment":"Sleak clean lines, and a smaller size which I love.

Comes well packed with cables and a set up guide - very helpful.Once I had it installed, I did notice an immediate improvement in my network as I connected additional devices to the network. The speed was much better than my previous router regardless of how many devices were running. So I was happy from the get go. Also, the range seemed to be better right away.This router has parental control features for all of the obvious reasons and also blocking of malicious sites. You have some control over what you would like to filter or not. I did not have this option with my previous router. My favorite part is ability to create a \"guest\" account. There is also a USB port to enable file sharing.Very nice router at a decent price. A good value overall.","rating":4},{"comment":"Got this to replace the Verizon router M1424WR.

Since we're not doing this, we have decent range with current router, am not going to go through all of these steps. I was hoping for better internet speed, but appears only way to do that is to upgrade the Fios package and I have no need to do that.No disrespect to Belkin, I'll return this if you wish since it was free.","rating":2},{"comment":"My house has a big center chimney, which I have long blamed for the fact that people upstairs have only marginal access to the internet. I thought that this router might solve the problem, but it hasn't. Really, I don't see any increase in range or download speed as compared to my old Linksys router. (I also had to lay it on its side to fit the bookshelf space allocated to my VOIP bridge and wi-fi router. I suppose it's possible that that restricts the range, though it seems unlikely.) Finally, I had a devil of a time setting it up. I prefer my own password rather than the default version, but once I'd change the password (security code) in my browser, nothing I did would allow me to get back on the internet. Finally I did the old fallback and turned off the power to the modem and router and VOIP bridge. That worked.Update: okay, I will uninstall the router this afternoon and put it in the trash. It does work, after a fashion, so I won't give it a one-star rating as I am tempted to do, but it's not nearly as good as my old router, which I will now put back into operation. With this one, my wife upstairs just can't access the internet at all, the first time that's happened in twenty years, with three different routers.","rating":2},{"comment":"Belkin AC1200 Dual band wireless router:First off, the 1200, along with the rest of the current Belkin line, has one of the more attractive sleek designs out there.Being a bit of a geek, I was slightly put off to discover there is no in-bod documentation outlining everything this router can do.  However, once I powered it up, I found that there really is no need.All you need to do to connect to it (via wireless) is to connect to the default SSID provided on a card tucked discreetly into the bottom of the device.  If you're running wired, just run a patch cable from one of the 4 LAN ports to your computer's NIC.Once connected, setup can proceed in one of two ways.You can either go through teh setup wizard, which is very straight forward, or select the link from the setup page to take you straight to the dashboard where you can tweak functionality yourself. There are plenty of things to play with as well.  As with most new network equipment today, it is capable of native IPV6, and has parental controls.It also has built in guest access, media server, firewall functionality and several other handy options.For those less inclined to mess around with things, the AC1200 works perfectly well right out of the box once you go through the quick initial setup.  Speed was on par with most other 802.11n capable routers\/APs I've seen and the radio signal was noticeably stronger through greater distances than my older 802.11g wireless router.Overall, I would say it's a nicely designed piece of equipment that has a very easy-to-use set-up via a simple interface and also has all the bells and whistles for the more tech savvy.","rating":4},{"comment":"I was hoping I could upgrade my similarly-looking Belkin N450 with AC1200 and things looked very promising: Setup was easy for anyone even with limited set of knowledge about networking, no setup CDs to speak of(although those always made great-looking coasters.)  It is also very stylish and reminds me of a sideways alien ship, so you actually proud to display it instead of stashing it away from sight.  Intellistream setting really does feel like it gives your streaming videos more boost and less lag in multiplayer gaming.However, while working with Roku 3 in one room, the connection kept on dropping from Roku 2XD in another.  When going to setting in Roku 2, the network would be found about 50% of the time.  Before I get pummeled with torches and pitchforks, I have tried numerous solutions, such as rebooting and even factory-reseting Roku 2XD and getting limited Belkin support, but with no success.  May be my Roku 2 broke, you say?  Well, as soon as I plugged in my old Belkin N450, Roku 2XD is fully-functional again with no connection issues.  This is a shame as I was hoping to get a new and faster router.  So this is clearly a mixed bag for me, but if everything works for you, then this could be your definite router choice for years to come.","rating":4},{"comment":"I totally agree with other reviewers concerning the range being lower than I'd hoped&#8212;my current router definitely has better range, especially for access on the second story of my house (the router is on the first floor) or outside in the backyard.

It was pretty fast but lagged when I connected a few wireless devices at the same time. I also have a wireless security camera that uses a lot of bandwidth.

They include the yellow networking cable that attaches the router to the modem,the power cord and a simple start guide. You can set this router up with a tablet,smartphone or a computer. No set up disc or apps needed to set this router up. In 3  SUPER simple steps (3-5 minutes) I was up and running! I used my KIndle HDX to set it up. Once setup you can go to http:\/\/router to personalize your settings.I had immediate improvement in my signal strength. With the new router there is no lag when I am using multiple wireless devices. In the past I had to drop my camera from the wifi if I wanted my laptop to be faster.My range is also much improved. Basically everything is running much faster.This router has many nice features:* Filtering Options to block malicious,adult and other non-family friendly sites,phishing scam sites and also sites that contain sexually explicit material, mature content, abortion, alcohol, tobacco, crime, cult, drugs, gambling, hate, suicide or violence. You can also select to NOT filter any site. As far as I can tell the filtering option that you select affects all the devices connected to the router not just a childs device.* Parental internet control that allows you to customize a time schedule to block internet access for each connected device.* Guest access:When turned on, guest access will create a separate Wi-Fi network that can still access the Internet, but not other devices on your network.* One usb port:Connect a USB storage device or a USB printer to enable wireless file sharing and wireless printing.Thats just a few of the features the  AC1200 router offers.Overall,this is great router. Its fast and super easy to use. I just started using it this week so, if I encounter any issues I will update my review.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Belkin AC1200DB is a nice high performance dual band AC+ router than anyone can setup in a couple of minutes.The router comes fully assembled with both the power plug and Ethernet cable plugged in.  All it takes to setup is to plug the Ethernet cable to the modem supplied by your network provider and plug the router to a\/c power.Then you get the card with router password from the bottom of the router, connect a notebook, tablet or phone to the router by selecting the pre-configured router name and password, open your browser, go to the website, press yes a couple of times to check for updates and accept or change the password.  At that point you are done.  This router is pre-configured to be secure with a strong password so almost no effort is needed to get it running.If desired, there is a full range of advanced features so you can disable guest access, block websites, use parental controls and many other things, but it took me only a few minutes to open the box and get secure dual band WiFi running in my house.This WiFi router is is a great option if you want something simple and fast with no fuss.The AC1750 DB model is a little more expensive and provides faster 5Ghz WiFi for devices that have 802.11ac capability.  But unless you have that capability you will not notice a difference because most WiFi devices will run full speed on this router.","rating":5},{"comment":"Straight out of the box the Belkin router set-up is very straight forward even for a non-technical person - if you are technie, logging into the router and configuring in the interface isn't a problem either. I have about a dozen wireless devices and this router has offered decent performance on a AT&T; U-Verse connection. Compared with cheaper routers, this is a significantly better option for both speed and ease of use.The issue is definitely with the LAN performance, as highlighted by Wayne's review - his numbers are spot on. In my situation, I've put this router behind the cable modem with the wireless devices plugged directly into the modem to avoid this issue. But when I plug these into the Belkin, the wired performance is noticeably slower on the same network.","rating":4},{"comment":"There are currently 3 commercial speeds of wireless transmission, usually referred to as G, N, and now AC. N has been around for a long time, but lots of people, including all AT&T; Uverse customers, still use G (the slowest.) But I have been looking forward to, drooling for, AC. My husband even upgraded my laptop's wireless card in preparation for the glorious day (http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00DMCVKMU). And when the day came, it was the BELKIN AC1200 that ushered it in.Executive Summary: Buy it.Details: I did extensive testing of the unit before deciding to replace my current, highly-rated N speed router. I took pages of speed tests and the results were shocking. Unbelievable. I hesitate to say them because I would never believe them if I hadn't taken them myself. But here goes:I tested the N router and the BELKIN AC router, using my Dell, Windows 8.1 laptop with the card I mentioned above, as well as my iPad. First, the N router, since it was already in place. I got a consistent 3.5 Mbps download speed. It ranged, based on distance, going to 4.5 very close to the router. Upstairs, was erratic, ranging from 1 to 4 Mbps. Numbers on the iPad2 were slower but with the same trends. Upload speeds across all tests were around 1.16 Mbps.Next came the BELKIN AC1200. First, I plugged it straight into the Motorola Surfboard modem and plugged me laptop into it using an Ethernet cable. I wanted a baseline. And the baseline was 17.5 Mbps down and 1.18 up. Then I reconfigured the AC1200 to be an access point and not the main router. I have an old (ancient) Linksys WRT54G for that. So I plugged that back into the modem and the BELKIN into it with my laptop still connected by Ethernet. No change. 17.5 down, 1.18 up. Then I removed the Ethernet cable and connected the laptop wirelessly. I ran these tests countless times because I didn't believe them. I used different websites for testing and they were all in the same ballpark. I got exactly the same values wirelessly - 17.5Mbps down and 1.18 up. Those values remained consistent until upstairs where they dropped to between 1 and 2 Mbps.Of note, I tried the tests with the 2.4GHz band and the 5.0Ghz band. I got the same values with both, but the 2.4GHz band gave me better performance overall.  I also tried BELKIN's proprietary Intellistream QoS feature and got only slightly slower speeds with it.For $100 (at time of review), this is a remarkable device. I'm floored. I even reconnected my N Router and the tests again with the same results as before. And then did it again for the BELKIN. It's simply 4-5 times faster.Bad Stuff: There are no LEDs showing network traffic, no way to mount it on the wall, and this unit only has \"Fast\" Ethernet ports, not Gigabit ports. These may not matter to you. As you can see from notes, the lack of Gigabit ports has no bearing on the speed of your connection. But if you transfer a lot of large files on your local net, say from your computer to a storage device, then you might want to get an extra gigabit router. They're cheap enough. As for wall mountings, there's always duct tape, I suppose.I didn't test most of the other features like parental controls, but I do want to tell you about something else that really surprised me - the setup. The BELKIN is VERY user-friendly. It even tells you when things aren't connected properly (or so I'm told!) I have a lot of experience with router setup and this one was actually pleasant to configure and in my case, reconfigure.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Belkin AC1200 is a snap to setup. The Belkin is much faster than my previous wireless router so I am glad I made the change. I also like that the router offers home users with advanced features such as an option to allow guest access to the network. Highly recommended!","rating":5},{"comment":"I was looking forward to the arrival of the Belkin AC1200 router as I had a I have a Linksys WRT54G that I have used for over a decade; and it still works. The AC1200 was a fast and easy setup right out of the box. It comes with simple to follow instructions and was up and running literally in minutes. The antennas are inside of the vertical standing covering so you can not position them, Though this has not affected my performance and the case seems more fragile then the router it is replacing.With the Belkin AC1200 I have an improvement in signal strength throughout my domicile and less lag. I am running multiple computers on this network. This router has features that the home user will even want to use. From parental controls, to overall system filtering and the one I liked, a guest access option. The Guest Access option allows you to have a  second yet slower Wi-Fi network with its own password that you can give to other to use to access the internet. Thus leaving your network more secure.Please remember that I am not a computer guy and my last router is over a decade old. So I do not know how this would stand up compared to the  more expensive ac routers that are out there. But then again they are at a much higher price then this unit and would be out of my price range. For my home network I find this to be an improvement. Now lets see if it can last as long as my Linsys has.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a nice, general purpose router. It is relatively inexpensive and great for someone who wants to get a home wifi network up and running quickly. That being said, there were a couple of drawbacks.The good:* The router has a thin, sleek design. While I have mine hidden behind the TV, I think it would look just fine exposed on a computer desk or entertainment center.* The router is EXTREMELY easy to set up. This makes it a great choice for people who are unfamiliar with router functions and security settings.* The router allows for a guest network and sets it up automatically. However, it is also very easy to disable.* The parental controls features seemed pretty straight-forward and easy to use.The bad:* This router doesn't quite have the range of my previous one. I can't tell if it is because the antennae are housed within the body of the router or what, but I have very little connectivity on my deck. With my previous router, this was not a problem.* The router us advertised as being for streaming video, however I have noticed more issues with buffering rather than less. I've also noticed air play between my laptop and TV dropping, where I haven't had that happen until putting this router in.Overall, I think it is a pretty good home wifi router. I'd recommend it for someone who wants something that works with very little effort and doesn't feel like tweaking settings to get the most out of their network. Those options just aren't available with the control panel. 4 of 5 stars because they definitely play to their intended audience with easy of setup and use.","rating":4},{"comment":"I swapped out our previous router and tried several things to try to give a better review.First: Wireless PrinterI had no issues connecting the printer to the network.  I do have issues, however, if I try to scan something and send it to my laptop in the bedroom.  I have not been able to do it without getting a message that my laptop had to be reconnected to the printer.  My apartment is small - &#62;900 sq. ft, so it's not like the bedroom is super far away.  I'm not sure if this is truly a range issue, or maybe that there are other Wi-Fi signals interfering *because* I'm in an apartment, but I didn't have to sync the printer and the laptop as often with my previous router.Second: On-line Game PlayI use Xbox live for Multiplayer games and I prefer a wireless connection.  I have noticed that as long as my Xbox is close, this is not an issue, but if I want to play in the bedroom, my connection is weak.  This is an issue for me because in the bedroom, I can play Xbox on the projector, and who doesn't like BIGGER explosions and bad guys?Third:  Range overallIf I use the laptop in the living room, close to the router, I have a great signal and have no problem streaking movies from Prime or Netflix.  I can watch in HD without issue.  If I take the laptop into my bedroom, I can only watch in SD and sometimes it still gets hung up a bit.  Considering the only thing that changes there is my location, I'd say it's an issue of signal strength, yea?In general, the router was really easy to set-up.  I'm not SUPER tech-inclined, and it didn't take me any phone calls to tech support or even a friend to get my laptop, printer, and Xbox connected.  I haven't had any issues with it yet, either.  What keeps it from being 5 stars in meeting my needs is simple signal strength.  If I could stream HD in my room, it would be a 5-star review.","rating":4},{"comment":"Belkin makes some good products, this is exactly that, good. This replaces a few years old Netgear Wireless N router. It's sleek, black and stands nicely so it's a bit out of the way.Setup-Easy setup. I was up and running with just a few settings made in a minute. It's dead simple. Our internet is 20MBs, so it's decent.Range-I get coverage through the house but it drops off at the furthest point a bit. The speed is better than the Wireless N, but it seems the range is not as good as the slower router it replaced. So, faster but a very slightly reduced range for us.Performance-Our mobile devices do well and the speed is noticeably better on them. Maybe as they are the newest we have? Works well with Chromecast (we did have to adjust a setting). All in all, a very solid performance. My iPad is noticeably faster and that's always welcome.Notes-We have this in the office and it's connected to the NAS server via USB hub.  If we didn't have the hub, the single USB wouldn't allow us to connect to the printer(s) and the NAS. A second one would be nice. I do like the guest access option, but you should know that it is enabled by default.Bottom Line:It's a good router and one that will meet the needs of most people. It's really easy to use and set up, so the average person will be up and running with it in under 5 minutes, but probably half that time. This isn't a cheap router, nor a top of the line, but it will be a very good option for most people. The nice part is you can set it up and your done, but if you want to tinker, there's a lot of controls available to you.","rating":4},{"comment":"This router has worse range than the one I wanted to replace, and it is not immediately compatible with my Fios.","rating":2},{"comment":"I have gone through several routers and I have tried cheap ones, medium range ones, expensive ones. This one falls somewhere in the middle. It is good for the home user (an apartment) that doesn't require a lot of power out of their router.The SETUP is super easy. Anyone that is not comfortable with technology can easily set this up.The LOOK is nice. It has a thin sleek body that will not clash a lot with decor. It can go very well with the modern decor.The RANGE is not that good. For a 1,000 apartment it is ok but it drops dramatically right after that. For 20 bucks more you can get thisRouterand get a lot (A LOT) more range.I did not encounter too many issues with streaming but the TV is right next to the router and there was no other interference. Nothing to get in the way. The SPEED and PERFORMANCE were acceptable to the price range.Overall, a solid router for those that are just looking for something basic. If you are looking to do something more with a router (hooking up external devices, etc) this might not be the best thing for you.","rating":4},{"comment":"Easy to setup. I had it going in about 10 minutes without doing much more than skimming the instruction card that came with it and logging in to the web interface. It performed adequately with streaming apps such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime.

Both bands are a full 10db lower than my current router (for every three db you either double or cut the power in half).3.  The guest network is only available on the 2.4Ghz band.4.  The guest network is NOT encrypted.  It requires a password to access, but it is not encrypted.5.  The unit does not appear to support a repeater function.There appears to be two versions of this unit out there.  The difference is in their specific model numbers and in features.  This particular model does not impress me enough to recommend it.","rating":3},{"comment":"This is a really fast wireless router to set up - took about 10 minutes and most of the time was spent finding it an open outlet near the modem.  It's nice that the set up is all by iPhone.  You really don't need to be a tech wiz to take care of this, which is nice.  It's also a fairly nice-looking thing to have out in plain view, unlike uglier routers that sometimes have antennae all over the place.  Most importantly, it really does seem to make a significant difference in wifi speed.  If you are streaming multiple sources and using netbooks and\/or internet sites from multiple places in your home, this will do the trick.  Definitely recommend checking it out.","rating":5},{"comment":"It wouldn't be a bad move to install this Belkin AC1200. It is ridiculously simple to install, and easily outperforms the rather weak router we've rented from our ISP for the last three  years. No more signal problems with the upstairs PC that I'm using to write this review, and speed is noticeably improved. No doubt this is due to the dual-band, which combines a standard band and a much faster media band for video, gaming and the like. It's nice, also, to have the four Ethernet ports and the USB 2.0 port, though we may not ever use them. We did need to tell the provider about the change, as we got messages that the router was not being recognized...no big deal, but I'd advise doing that as soon as you install to save bother.The only real issue I found is that the cord for the AC 1200's AC adaptor is not long enough. I had to set my power strip on a box to compensate. But that's a minor complaint, admittedly. I've used Belkin products before, and have been happy with them. You could upgrade to the AC 1750, but this Belkin router is a good performer, not badly priced and should be considered by anyone who is renting a router, as it will pay for itself fairly quickly.","rating":4},{"comment":"It does work and does have a wizard more or less that walks you thru the setup.  It does offer to find your existing connection and set it up for you. However, I have normal broadband and the wizard could not pick up the information and use it via the automatic setup wizard.  I therefore had to manually program it when in my opinion it should have been a basic setup.  Also two other drawbacks: it only has 10\/100 ports, not 10\/100\/1000 as most higher end routers do now.  Also, it will connect your exterior drive using the usb port and it will serve as a media drive.  However, if you want to simply use the usb drive as a data drive and share it via the network - it will not see it properly to do this.Good points: it does work as a dual band router and the wifi signal does seem to broadcast a fairly impressive good distance.","rating":4},{"comment":"I am going to give an honest review from someone who isn't very tech savvy.  I had a Belkin to begin with, but it was smaller and at least three years old.  I had a PS4 and found I could not play with all people online because of a strict LAN or WAP line.  (I think that is what it is called) After many calls I discovered that with newer wifi items you had to have newer routers for it all to work smoothly.  I have been on a tight budget these last two months so that was out of the question for some time.  Finally I got this router and once I hooked it up turned on my PS4 to give it a try.  The first game allowed me to link with a friend the first time where in the past it took 6 or 7 times.  I turned on the game that was giving me the most problems.  This game actually gives me a warning when it boots up that I would not be allowed to play with everyone because of my connection.  The game loaded up and this time, and with this new router I had no warnings!  Now for the ultimate test.  I turned over to my Netflix on my smart tv and tried to load up a movie.  In the past with my old router it would stop at 25% and take forever.  That is if it booted up at all, and when it did boot up the picture remained fuzzy.  It was a new model TV so I assumed it had the same problem with the older router.  After hooking up this router it hardly had a load time.  It blew past 25% and the picture popped on crystal clear.  The specs on the box says it 2.8x faster, ultimate range, up to 300Mbps+867 Mbps speed.  I have no idea what this means but my games work, my Netflix works, and my laptops work so I am happy.  It was easy to install and for it to completely work the first time you have to log on and input your information to register.  It was easy and only took about 5 minutes.  As with all my reviews if I discover a problem I will update it and if you have questions I will answer them as soon as I see them in my inbox.","rating":5},{"comment":"Between our Android phones, iPod Touch, tablets, Tivos, Chromecast, Rokus, smart TV, laptops, printer, networked hard drives, and security cameras, we tend to really ask a lot of our router's wireless capability and internet connection.

It is easy to set up, has good range, and works very fast even when streaming video to multiple devices simultaneously. We recommend it.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a lightweight sleek router.  However, it's not easily compatible with Verizon Fios.  In order to make it work you must go through a lengthy process where you change your Verizon router to bridge mode.  &#34;In bridge mode, the Verizon hardware becomes a pass-through device allowing your third party router to function properly.&#34;  In other words, you need to keep using your existing hardware and add this router.  Considering that my current router works extremely well, I didn't proceed with the installation in my home.  I installed it in my mother's home and found the installation to be quick and easy. However, there was no noticeable change in the connection speed.  My mother lives in a small one bedroom apartment so we didn't experience any issues with connectivity.  The router itself relatively compact, but you can't mount it on a wall or lay it on it's side.  This is a good router for a nontechnical person that is looking for something that can quickly be installed.","rating":3},{"comment":"This router has about the same range as your standard N600 router with the added capability of using the a\/c band. There are better routers out there that provide faster a\/c speeds. This is a medium quality router, just like the N600's are\/were. There is nothing special about this router that I can detect. It is easy to setup. That is a plus. The interface is fine if port forwarding or static ip setup is required. Overall, this is just a mid-level router. One major note would be the WAN port is rated at 100mbps. If your service level is rated higher that 100mbps, you don't want this router. There are only a couple providers at this time that have those kind of speeds available here in the states.","rating":4},{"comment":"At least half of the people considering this router are non-technical and just want to either upgrade or replace a broken existing router or upgrade to wireless access in their home. Since the technical aspects of this router's capabilities have been covered very succinctly by several other reviewers, this review is aimed at the non-technical consumer.In the box, you'll find the router, an ethernet cable, a quick start guide and a power supply. That's it. And that's really all you need. The remarkable thing about this router is that it's designed to be easily set up from a computer, a tablet or even a smart phone!Here are the steps I took: I removed the card located in a little slot underneath the base of the router and set it next to my tablet. The card has the factory set router name and password on it.Next, I plugged the ethernet cable included into a port on the back of my cable modem.Then I plugged this router's power supply into the back of the router and a nearby electrical outlet.After that, I plugged the ethernet cable into the yellow port (which looks like a phone jack) on the back of the router.I went to my tablet and went to the wifi\/wireless settings and looked for available networks. I clicked on the belkin.6ba and then clicked Connect. This prompted me to enter the password printed on the little card.After my tablet connected to the router, I was immediately taken to the Belkin website, where it automatically searched for any firmware updates that might be available and then prompted me to register my router.That's it. I was on wifi within literally 3 minutes. This is a definite plus for people who aren't comfortable with technical aspects of their computer life.There is a very well-written and easy to understand user's manual available for download at Belkin's website and it's worth looking at. There are various tweaks you can make in your router settings that will give you the best performance for your needs, especially if you have several users and you also stream video or play online video games or have a VoIP phone. The manual tells you exactly how to do this in a very straightforward way. But if this scares the pants off of you, know that you can leave things just as they are and you will still have wifi access.The AC part of this router refers to the latest wifi technology and can give you much better wireless speeds IF you have devices that use this protocol. Otherwise, the router will work at whatever speed your computer, smart phone, Roku or game console is capable of. So if your equipment isn't fairly new, you won't get the fastest speeds Belkin says this router is capable of. Even so, I do notice faster speeds and less lag when streaming and surfing over the router I replaced with this.If you do have new devices which can use the AC protocol, this still isn't the router I would recommend because of the port capabilities. I would suggest the Belkin AC1750 DB in that case.Because of the reasonable price and the ease of installation and set-up, I can recommend this router for non-techies and for people who just want a good wireless router but aren't looking for the fastest AC protocol speeds possible.","rating":4},{"comment":"I had high hopes for the Belkin AC1200 Dual Band Wireless AC Router, but it's not working as well as the old Linksey's it replaced.Installation is truly easy and that's a selling point.

And my Kindle Fire sometimes loses its wireless connection when I go into the breakfast room. Again, a new issue. (If we lived in a truly large house this would be more understandable, but it's just a small surburban cottage.)We're seriously thinking about re-installing the old Linksey....","rating":3},{"comment":"I have clearly been living in the dark ages for the last several months.After moving to a new apartment, we were using the wireless router installed on the cable box provided by the cable provider. It worked all right, but I always thought our wireless speeds were sub-par.The change when I installed this wireless router was just amazing. Easily a 10Mbps improvement over the previous crappy router.First of all - the set-up was pretty straight-forward. I expected the router to just work, but strangely enough, setup was required. The browser function is a breeze, and luckily, the default ip address is different than the cable modem, so I have no issues accessing both at once. Just a few seconds here and there and the modem set itself up.Our one-level, 4 bedroom 1700 sq foot apartment is no issue for this router. The signal reaches all the way across the house, even to the back bedrooms. Everyone using the  home router is already impressed at the speed improvement to all devices.So the speed is great, I have no problem using the wireless computers in distant rooms, and video streaming is significantly improved.The rest of the extras are nice-to-haves. I'm not sold on all the bells and whistles,but the dual band feature is clearly working and the little extras, like the guest account, are nice-to-haves that I'm actually enjoying more.No significant changes to the wired devices that were hooked up tot he old router, but I think the point of this is all about the wireless. And my family (easily 5 people using different devices at any given time) is getting a lot of use out of it.My past experience says that routers have a usable life of 12-18 months, so I'd have to wait a while to tell you about it's life expectancy, but for now - we're all very much enjoying using this router.My only regret now is looking at the back of the box, I realize that there's another modem, the AC1750DB, that appears to put this one to shame. I would love to try that one and see the difference.I have definitely learned my lesson about going the cheap route with regards to home internet routers.","rating":5},{"comment":"Allow me to explain my issue with this router. First, please note my use of MB (Mega Bytes) and Mb (Megabits). As there are in fact 8 bits in a byte, if you want to do the math, simply divide by 8 when going from MB to Mb. Simple enough, but I want to clarify this as marketing loves going by Bits and Windows likes Bytes.On the box for the Belkin AC1200 it clearly notes that the 4xLAN ports are 100Mb ports, which translates to 10MB, of course. There's no mention of how fast the 5th Modem port is. But for an 802.11a\/b\/g router, it wouldn't matter as they'd max out at 54Mb\/s. Yes, I'm still going by unrealistic advertised speeds, but hang with me here. For 802.11ac, it's advertised at 867Mbps on the 5GHz band and even 300Mbps on 2.4Ghz. At least on the box for the AC1200, 802.11ac can theoretically go faster with the right hardware (i.e. the AC1750).In real-world use, you're naturally looking at roughly half those speeds, if not less. Wireless is half-duplex (it can't send\/receive at the same time like your LAN connection). It's also prone to interference, range, etc. So let's just say we're looking at \"real-world\" 400Mbps on AC\/5Ghz, or what should translate to a 50MB\/s transfer rate. Sure, I'm sitting right next to the router and there's nothing else near-by. I'm feeling optimistic here.So what happens when you try to transfer files over your speedy AC Wi-Fi connection to your LAN? Well, you'd hope the Modem port is Gigabit (1000Mb) so data can go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, it is not. The modem port is also 100Mb. What this means is that you'll never see speeds past 10MB\/s when transferring files in Windows via your LAN. Or if you're ISP (Internet Service Provider) connection is faster than this, you're also capped at 100Mb or 10MB.So where will you actually see these AC speeds? Perhaps going wireless to wireless from one AC device to another AC device or maybe using the USB 2.0 port on the router with a dedicated drive. Keeping in mind WiFi to WiFi is usually pretty slow, regardless of the connection. But that's about it.I spoke with Belkin technical support and after verifying with their supervisors, confirmed that this is in fact \"working as designed.\" In my opinion, quite poorly. Personally, I can't recommend this device unless you really only care about WiFi to WiFi speed. If that fits your requirements, it's an otherwise descent little router. It's got plenty of basic features, easy to setup, cheap, etc. But for me, I'd spend a bit more on a better model.","rating":2},{"comment":"So I attempted to install this on my laptop which is running Windows 8.1 and it doesn't seem to work.  I can't install the drivers to make it work.  So I had to use this on my desktop which is much older running on Windows 7.  That worked fine!  Install was easy and quick.  The dual band receiver was able to work at a distance of about 25 feet from the router with no issues.  The speed of the the bandwidth is great and you can't tell whether or not you are on a wireless unless you do a speed test.  However, this is perfect for the casual surfer.  I used this for a few days now and I think it's a great way to convert any older desktop into a wireless device. Probably not for any newer computer since they all come with wireless.

While it&#8217;s all plastic and has some flex to it, the overall feel is a bit more solid than you would expect at this price point.The backlighting is a nice feature and it&#8217;s easy to switch between three colors (or turn it off) via a single key press. Note, however, that the key lettering is NOT illuminated &#8211; the keys are solid plastic, so the only illumination is on the boarder of the keys. It looks nice in that it makes the keys look like they are floating on a bed of light, but it does not help see what the key actually is when it&#8217;s dark.The layout is pretty standard, and there&#8217;s highly visible caps and num lock indicators. While having an indicator is a great feature, these are a bit too bright and large &#8211; they are so noticeable to be distracting, especially in low light.The key throw is fairly long and there is only a small amount of tactile feel to it. The keys make a soft clacking sound when pressed. I&#8217;m not that impressed with the key feel &#8211; it&#8217;s too mushy to be called a firm press keyboard (such as some in the Microsoft line) but is too firm to be similar to a short throw laptop keyboard. While shooting for the middle ground sometimes works, in this case it didn't produce a key feel that I found pleasant.Installation is quick and easy &#8211; no drivers are needed on a Win 7 machine (and, I would expect, pretty much any Win machine running XP or higher). It&#8217;s a corded keyboard so you&#8217;ll need to have access to a free USB port to plug it in.There are fold-out legs on the back to prop it up. There&#8217;s a decent size ledge for resting your wrist. It comes with what appears to be a small instruction sheet, but since all the writing is in Chinese I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s instructions or warranty info.It&#8217;s a decent keyboard for the price, but not something that I consider to be outstanding. 3 stars.[Sample provided for review]","rating":3},{"comment":"The first thing that I noticed is that this Keyboard is heavier and better made than my original desktop keyboard.This keyboard is backlighted in red and so easy to see the keys in a dark room or dimly lit room!And know that this is an EVERYDAY KEYBOARD, not just for gaming!

No matter the keyboard used, when gaming, I tend to be very aggressive with the keys just to ensure my inputs are taken.  When it's life and death in a game, I'd rather over compensate than make a poor press that didn't register.  The Havit is made for this kind of gaming and can take the abuse.  The keys also have a very responsive feel making them great for tougher games.An awesome feature to not overlook is that the keyboard is backlit.  This is a must on a gaming keyboard because often times I like to play most games in the dark for better screen viewing.  With dark rooms comes keys that can be difficult to see.  Not with the Havit X1, you can customize the backlit color from red, blue, or pink\/purple.  I personally like the blue.  I know my keyboard layout pretty well, but sometimes when I just forget, this is a life saver.  You can even turn off the light when not needed.While perfect for gaming, this is a keyboard that is great for a computer you also do regular computing on.  Word processing, web browsing, and so on, it has all the keys I need for those uses too.  I have enjoyed using theHAVIT X1and really believe it's a solid gaming keyboard.[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]&#8195;","rating":5},{"comment":"The keys feel very comfortable when pressed. They kind of spring back in response to my pressing them and that feel great. I was told it has a mechanical feel, whatever that is, I do not fully know as I have never owned a nicer keyboard than this one. I feel as if I am for the first time in my life using a real keyboard, a very responsive keyboard and one that will last.The individual keys are very easy to read. The one I had was hard to see, as the keys were not as well made, not as bright. The only thing I do not like about the keys is that they themselves do not light up in the dark.You see, this keyboard has a three color back light built in. What that means is there are three choices of color and the space around the keys lights up to reflect that choice of colors you have made. You can choose from Red, Blue, and Purple. You can have just that one color or you may have the keyboard cycle between all three. Also, you can speed up or slow down the rate at which they cycle. A nice feature to be sure.The function keys all have a secondary function assigned to them. They control things like the volume, media and more. There are also the standard arrow keys which can have &#8220;WASD&#8221; reassigned to them if you desire. Just remember to switch them back or when you go to type a &#8220;W&#8221; you will get an up arrow instead.One of perhaps the coolest features of this keyboard is that it is waterproof. I personally have not tested this feature. Something about intentionally pouring water on my electronics does not seem right to me. If however I do accidentally do so in the future, I will let you know what happens. There are 4 large drain holes on the bottom of the board to allow liquids to pass through.","rating":4},{"comment":"If you're looking for a fancy mechanical keyboard, there are any number of elaborate and expensive models in the marketplace.  The Havit Gaming Keyboard claims to have a &#34;mechanical keyboard structure&#34; (the keys can be removed independently, the typing and gaming functions are pretty smooth), but it is still a membrane keyboard.  I wanted to be clear about this because it might be easy to get lost in the semantics of the description.  As a membrane keyboard, however, I found this one fairly impressive for a basic gaming model.  Truthfully, I'd probably rank this a solid four stars on most criteria.  What influences me to go up to five stars, though, is the price.  I'm usually not swayed to factor price into my evaluation, but I'll make an exception here.  The Havit Gaming Keyboard is an extremely good value for its price point.  So if you're looking for solid performance, cool design, and an affordable price--this combines all three elements.Appearance:At first glance, the keyboard itself does seem a little flimsy and even a bit pliable.  However, it is well designed and has a good undercarriage with height control and cord maintenance.  The black on white aesthetic is both unusual and attractive.  And the keyboard has lots of choices when it comes to backlighting.  You can choose solid blue, purple, or red (or off).  There is adjustable brightness and you can even opt for a pulsating effect.  In addition, the logo in the bottom right also lights up as do the number, capitals, and scroll lock keys.  I liked just playing with the backlight features, that's how lame I am!Operation:The functionality is pretty much what you'd expect from a gaming computer.  The function keys double as fairly typical media keys and everything that you need is in place to get your gaming battles on.  The keyboard claims that 19 keys can work simultaneously, but I've never hit that many keys at once in my life.  With the Havit, I've probably gotten up to ten with no issues or conflict.  I do like the soft touch of the keyboard (with big solid keys) that feel nice when typing or gaming.  Overall, I'm very pleased.  I love the look of this keyboard, I like the function and use of it, and I love the price.  It won't break the bank and it's still pretty awesome, the Havit is a winner for me.

If you are using a different operating system you will need to experiment with the top row and function key combinations.It is technically a mechanical keyboard because of the nested plunger style mechanism under the keys. The key press required to activate a key has a little more travel than I am accustomed to, but I have been typing on laptop keyboards for so long that I have forgotten what a real keyboard feels like. In fact it took me a few hours to get use to the expansive real estate of this one.The key feel is very similar to other gaming keyboards that use the Cherry MX Black switches. The actual mechanism is different from the Cherry MX Black, but the feel and sound are near identical. One of the things that I love about this keyboard is the sculpted keys that remind me of those on a vintage IBM Selectric typewriter (I am definitely revealing my age.) The feel is nowhere near the same with respect to tactile feedback and that satisfying clack, but the key faces are darn close.I tested the function keys and the one marked mail invoked Outlook Express on my system, and one with the headphones icon (Function + F1) brought up Windows Media Player. Those apps were already associated in my operating system settings.While the instruction sheet is in Chinese, it was also graphical and displayed the key mappings. Although those are obvious anyway I hope that the company will ship English instructions to the US market. This is not an issue for me, but is an oversight that needs to be rectified.One thing that is cool is you can change the backlight of the keys from blue to red to pink. Or you can turn it off completely it it bothers you.While this is designed to work with Windows systems I did test it out on myKeedox Quad Core RK3188 Android 4.2 1080P 5G 2.4G HDMI Bluetooth 4.0 Smart TV BOX Network Media Playerand it worked perfectly as a keyboard. I am still exploring the mappings of the function keys.Overall this is an exceptionally well made keyboard that feels great (now that I have reacquainted myself with full size keyboards.) The feel is superior to my ThinkPad T61, and it allows me to fly when touch typing. If you spend most of your time developing or editing documents you will love this keyboard.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have become frustrated with how every new computer I buy has more cheaply made peripherals. My last keyboard went out after a few months and was complete junk. I was excited to get this keyboard, as it is substantially built, and is rugged. This keyboard reminds me of the type you used to get with a computer. I am just happy you can at least buy a nice keyboard like this now. It is rugged and well made. The keys are the real old type keys that you have to really press, which I like. I am impressed with all aspects of the functionality of this keyboard. As an added bonus, it really looks cool with the backlight. You can choose between three colors by pressing the lower right key next to the CTRL key.This is a great product and I am happy to have it.(I was provided a review sample.)","rating":5},{"comment":"I'd never bothered with backlit keyboards before because I always have enough light in my office where I work and game.  When I saw a video review of this one on Youtube, I thought it looked cool and wanted to give it a shot.  For the $40 current price, it is very solid and well made.  The feel and sound of the keys is just like an old classic mechanical keyboard, but with the modern electronics of a membrane keyboard.I'm not disappointed at all in this keyboard.  It looks really cool, and is fun and comfortable to type on.  The shortcut keys for things like the calculator, browser, and Outlook are really convenient, once you get in the habit of remembering to use them.","rating":5},{"comment":"I was offered this hub for an honest review, and, since I was in the market for one, I decided to try it out.

(However, when I tried to plug in my Apple Disc Drive to the device, I got an icon asking me to plug it in directly to the iMac). This compact hub is sleek, and very attractive when it is plugged in, with a sublime blue light.There are three ports on the top, and one on the side. The product does not support iPad, so I use it with my other devices. I have had no problems with this device, and it certainly helps me with the clutter on my desk.

I love the magnetized stand and the feel of the buttons. The spacing is really impressive considering the size limitations of the 10\" Galaxy.

I mean I just can't justify spending a third of the purchase price of Tab 4 for for an accessory, especially since I know I'll be upgrading when the next version comes out leaving me the proud owner of a $100 paperweight that only fits the Tab 4.","rating":3},{"comment":"For the life of me I cannot find anything substantively wrong with this keyboard!It is light, a pleasure to look at, and a pleasure to use. Yes, it is slightly cramped, but that is a function of the tablet it supports. The keys are well-laid out and responsive (they do not click when pressed).It has a distinct advantage over another favorite of mine (theBelkin QODE Slim Style Keyboard Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1'' (Black \/ Black) \/ Slim Style) because it has rubber feet at the lower corners so that the tablet screen does not come into contact with the keyboard keys. This happened with the Belkin case and as a result I have a slight bit of white lettering that transferred from the keyboard to my screen protector. Nothing truly annoying, but Logitech seems to have anticipated it could be more than just annoying.If I have any gripe, it is the price. Why do these things have to be so expensive? It's not like they can't be cheaper: comparable Belkin cases (using Amazon prices at the time of this review) are about a third cheaper. So the buyer is confronted with an interesting choice: with the Belkin you save over $30, with the Logitech case you get an incredibly aesthetically pleasing one. Maybe if Logitech did not spend so much money on the packaging, they could bring the cost down a bit (or is $99 retail the price consumers expect to see?).To my way of thinking, if cost is not a consideration this is THE case to buy for your Galaxy Tab 4 10.1. If cost is a minor consideration, I would say try to find the extra dollars. This is a beautiful case. Logitech should be commended for a job very well done.","rating":5},{"comment":"Very nice keyboard folio.

And yes I know that calling it &#34;typing&#34; dates me, but there it is.  The keys are not as prominent to the touch as I would prefer, but that is because I just can't get into the flatter keyboards.  Still, it is better than using the screen.","rating":5},{"comment":"Logitech has been one of my favorite peripheral and accessory manufacturers for a while. They have really thoughtfully designed products that in many ways supplement and even enhance the usability of your mobile devices. This Galaxy Tab 4 keyboard\/case combo is a perfect example of that high level style.The case is extremely well built and well designed. Galaxy Tab 4 slips into it easily, and it fits very snugly. The case is very sturdy and it gives your tablet quite a bit of protection. The case has a built in kickstand that allows you to angle the tablet under a variety of angles. Unlike some other kickstands that I&#8217;ve seen, this one designed in such a way that it allows you to use your tablet on your lap for typing. Even though this is a very light case relatively speaking, it will still add quite a bit of bulk to your Galaxy Tab. If you intend to use your Tab as a laptop replacement though, that might not be a very noticeable issue.The keyboard synced via Bluetooth with Galaxy Tab. The whole process was very smooth and quick. While it&#8217;s turned on the keyboard stays in touch with the tablet at all times, sometimes that is not always the case with the inferior wireless keyboards.The keyboard uses rechargeable batteries, and it can be charged through a USB cable. The keyboard will last you a several days to a few weeks, or even a month, on a single charge, depending on how much you use it. It takes about two to three hours to get it fully charged.One major shortcoming of this keyboard is its cramped size. This, of course, is not Logitech's fault, as it&#8217;s impossible to have the full keyboard functionality that fits a 10&#8221; device. The smaller keyboard is suitable enough for most short writing tasks, such as composing emails and shorter documents, but I would not rely on it for, say, writing of a Ph.D. thesis. The key action, however, is really good and it&#8217;s one of the best ones I&#8217;ve seen on any keyboard. It makes typing on such a cramped space much more tolerable.Another annoying thing for me is that there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much standardization when it comes to tablet sizes (and the appropriate cases) out there right now. Each tablet manufacturer has its own design that is different just enough from all the other ones on the market that it requires a complete overhaul of any of the accessories. It&#8217;s even more annoying that manufacturers even have very different designs for their own line of tablets, with changes from one generation to the next that sacrifice compatibility and functionality in pursuit of some aesthetical agenda. And then there is Samsung, with two different lines of tablets (Tab and Note) with incompatible sizes and ports. It forces you to completely revamp your whole accessory collection every time you upgrade your tablet, at not an insignificant price. I truly wish that at least the keyboard\/case manufacturers would come up with designs that are more universal. I understand that it&#8217;s impossible for them to know the direction that the tablet manufacturers would take in advance, but the least they can do is make the cases\/keyboards backward compatible with the previous generation of devices.","rating":4},{"comment":"I know a good Bluetooth keyboard is not cheap, because I had previously purchasedLogitech 920-003390 Tablet Keyboard for Android 3.0 Plusfor my Galaxy tablet.  That keyboard is a standalone, which means I have to tote it separately, so I was grateful to have the opportunity to test this \"all in one\" case and keyboard.The case has a sort of rubberized feel to the outside of it (not leather), whereas the interior (keyboard, stand, and corner mounts) is hard plastic.  This construction makes the Folio really lightweight and, I expect, durable, as well as providing good protection against knocks and bumps in a backpack or bag.  My guestimate is that it weighs approx as much as the Galaxy, so adding this to the tablet approx doubles the weight.  That's still pretty lightweight to carry around a tablet, case, and keyboard.The Folio anchors the tablet via the top corners, and a long bar across the bottom center edge.  This bar is what flips out to make the stand. It clips magnetically to the keyboard half with a magnet is so strong that you can pick up the top of the tablet and the stand will stay attached, but this also means the screen angle is not adjustable.  However, because of the rigid solid plastic anchor points, there is no flexibility in this case for other Galaxy models (ie: it does not fit my 10.1\" Tab Pro).  None.The keyboard paired easily with my Galaxy. It has its own rechargeable battery built-in and does not drain from the tablet. It is really nice to type on--keys have a nice tactile feel with the right bounce and pressure.  About the only issue is that the compressed size of the Folio (to fit the 10.1\" screen) means the keyboard is not quite full-sized like my standalone Logitech Bluetooth keyboard, but I found it easy enough to adjust to it after some use.In conclusion, I think this is a very well-crafted, sturdy, accessory for the Galaxy Tab 4.  It is a bit pricy, but considering that you get a brand name (come on, you know Logitech has been making great keyboards forever) Bluetooth keyboard and a case, plus the convenience of an \"all in one,\" I think that's justifiable.","rating":5},{"comment":"Pros:The case looks great and the construction quality of the case and keyboard both seems very good.The tablet stays in position while working - no slow-slide or flopping like some stands\/cases I've used.It pairs up easily and the connection is consistent.The keys have that pleasant rebound that good keyboards should have.One of the most important factors to me is that it's slim!  No unnecessary bulk!The exterior texture gives you a good grip on your device and can be wiped clean.Cons:The texture of the case means it can be a bit of a lint catcher.It's not cheap, but you usually get what you pay for.Possibly, the lack of number pad, but that should be expected for a keyboard of this size.","rating":4},{"comment":"Basically it is a regular keyboard with all of that nonsense on the right hand side chopped off.  The directional arrows are there, but you lose the numeric keypad, big deal.

With the folio for the Tab 3, I couldn't get the Note to fit in the case without cutting part of the corner away. That's not the case with this folio. The Note 10.1 2014 will go into it. However, it's not in there securely and so it will pop out. Also, you can't get the pen out.Okay, so maybe you have a Tab 4 and don't care about the Note at all. Here (again) is what I love about logitech keyboards: the layout. It's got a big enough right shift key and also a big enough delete key. The thing I do NOT particularly like about this folio is the texture of the outside of the case. I have a fabric lined bag (most bags are), and when I put it in and pull it out, this texture is almost sticky. But overall, it's a good keyboard case.","rating":3},{"comment":"A keyboard exponentially increases my usage and capability with a tablet and the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Folio hits the spot with its design and quality.The folio case is very well constructed - quality that we have come to expect from Logitech. The outside is rubberized plastic which provides a non-slip grip. The inside consists of a plastic frame (corners and a T-shaped base plate) that secures the Galaxy Tab. The T-shaped base is magnetic and when open secures to a magnetic strip just above the keyboard - this is the ONLY typing position available. The magnet is super-strong and holds the Galaxy Tab in place.The other half of the inside is an excellent Bluetooth keyboard - no lag and no connectivity drop. Logitech spaced out the keys and it really does help. Your hands are closer but the typing is just as fast and easy as my laptop. The keyboard is designed with 21 shortcut keys - from camera to volume control to launching a web browser.The case permits two positions - a typing and a flat viewing position. When closed there are small strong magnets on the inside center of the top case that secures to magnets on the bottom inside just under the keyboard - this gives a very secure feel when closed. When in the flat viewing position, the T-shaped base plate touches these magnets on the bottom inside but does not secure to them as the magnets in the base plate are perpendicular to the magnets on the bottom inside. Wish Logitech added a couple more magnets to the base plate so that I have the same secure feeling that I get when the case is closed.The case provides good protection against bumps and, since the outside is rubberized plastic, against wet counters and spills. Please note that the keyboard is NOT spill resistant.Weight without Tab: 1.1 lbThickness: 0.5\" to 0.75\"Recommended.Pros:* Well-designed* Rubberized exterior feels great to the touch* No lags or loss of connectivity in Bluetooth connectivity* Well spaced keys permit quick typing* 21 Keyboard shortcuts* Good frame design keeps Galaxy Tab secure* Galaxy Tab is secured by magnets in typing position - magnets permit typing on solid or soft surfaces* Outside case is bump\/scratch\/spill resistant* Great Battery LifeCons:* Expensive* No portrait typing mode - landscape only* Dedicated to a single model of Galaxy Tab 4","rating":4},{"comment":"The Big Bang Impact Case is a great case if your iPad Air is likely to be dropped; i.e., your employees use it in a store, you use it while traveling, or your kids use it.  I have dropped mine onto a wood floor, and the unit (and iPad) are fine.A little expensive, though.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is an extremely nice iPad case, though you will certainly be asked to pay quite a bit more money than most other cases to get it.The shape of the case feels very good in my hands, and the quality is excellent. Getting the iPad in is slightly awkward, since the flex in the case material means it can twist a little in your hands rather than having the tablet just snap in as it does for hard cases.It's very light and thin, and the overall effect is fairly neutral and professional. It's certainly the sort of case you could take to work with you without thinking that it might look silly or inappropriate.I'm very comfortable saying that it's worth having. In fact, I've had the opportunity to use a couple of other extremely nice iPad cases, and this one is my favorite among them overall. The big deciding issue for whether you should get it is going to be price. Paying for an extended warranty on your tablet is probably not going to come out to be dramatically more expensive than the cost of this case. The warranty would guarantee replacement or repair if something happens, while the case makes the need for replacement or repair much much less likely (and prevents general scratching and scuffing as well).If you rely on your iPad a lot for daily tasks, and take it with you a lot, I think this is a good investment. A warranty isn't good enough if being left without your device for a week while it gets fixed is a huge problem for you. Something like this that keeps the device nice is good for eventual resale value if you know that you're likely to want to trade up to a newer tablet in a year or two as well.On the other hand, if you use your tablet as a casual entertainment device and it wouldn't be horrible to have to live without it for a little while, it's probably worth doing the actual math for how much a warranty would cost you (or even just living with the possibility of needing to replace the device at full price) vs the cost of the cover at whatever time you're actually reading this. The math can be very different for a 16GB Wi-Fi only, vs a 128-GB Wi-Fi + Cellular, so I don't think there's one answer to whether it's a good investment.Is it a great case, though? Yes. Definitely.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have been an iPad user and fanatic since launch day of the first iPad, and I use mine absolutely all the time. To watch videos in bed, read magazines and books, view pictures, surf the web, get in-flight entertainment... The problem when you use your iPad so much is that it is is bound to get bumped; the aluminum case is prone to bend in corners, which in turn leads to glass breakage. Any concerned iPad owner will protect their expensive toy with a case, but unfortunately many cases offer much less protection than you'd think; despite spending all its life in a protective case, my poor iPad 3 suffered a corner bump which led to a cracked screen.I didn't want to take any chances with my new iPad Air, and the Logitech Big Bang seemed like just the ticket.The case is comprised of two bonded parts: a semi-rigid, clear rubbery shell which completely surrounds the iPad and offers a 1\/4&#34; protection around it, and a wrap-around cover articulated halfway around the back, which allows positioning the iPad at various angles in landscape mode. The cover contains sleep\/wake magnets so the iPad goes to sleep when you close the cover and wakes up when you open it -- just like a fridge!The rubbery case material should do a great job at absorbing shocks and preventing energy transfer to the iPad's aluminum body, and once closed the cover offers excellent protection to the screen; what I like best about this case is that this protection comes at a minimal cost in terms of added bulk -- but it is not lightweight.If you're in a market for a case to really protect your expensive iPad without adding the considerable bulk of an Otterbox case, the Big Bang is a great -- albeit expensive -- option. I would strongly caution you against cheap cases, which end up giving only the illusion of protection. My poor broken iPad 3 paid the price, but my new Air is now safe in its Big Bang and I'm ready for the zombie apocalypse!","rating":5},{"comment":"The Logitech Big Bang is a very protective, high quality case for my iPad Air.  I really like the feel of the flexible plastic piece that the case snaps into.  The cover is protective and you can use as a stand with multiple positions.  Overall the case offers great protection without a ton of extra bulk.  Highly recommend.","rating":5},{"comment":"Since we don't have kids in the house and are not generally tough on our electronics I hadn't given much thought to buying a protective case...until I ran over a 2-month old iPad with the car. (Note: Apple Care more than paid for itself that day.) I don't know that the Big Bang would save it from that, but it's great protection for everyday drops and spills and such. I especially like the soft edges that make the case feel good in your hands without feeling bulky. I like and recommend this and hope they introduce colors soon.","rating":5},{"comment":"It is a bit heavy compared to my Apple cover but I think it is better protection and it gives me the ability to stand it up in various angels.  I really like that.  It makes reading in bed a delight.  I just prop it on my tummy and read away!","rating":5},{"comment":"This Logitech Big Bang case provides great protection from abuse via a thick rubberize surround.  If you'll be using your iPad Air in an environment where it is likely to be abused - for example at a trade show with concrete floor - I would definitely consider this.  I don't like it at all for every day use, though, because of its weight and bulk.It's easy to slip the iPad Air into the case, but the cover is a little squirrelly - does not always shut perfectly like an Apple Smart Cover... and so the magnet to put the iPad to sleep or wake it up doesn't always do its thing.  The Logitech description says that the cover safeguards from accidental spills ... but it doesn't cover any of the ports - only the lock and volume buttons - so liquid spilled on the iPad can still enter the headphone jack, lightening charge port, speakers, etc.  The case is so thick, that it is impossible to plug a credit card reader into the headphone jack without buying a special extension cable.I would argue with the product description as \"ultra-slim, feather-light\".  Who are they kidding?  The case weights almost as much as the iPad Air itself!  My Air (cellular model) is 1.06 pounds and the case is .92 pounds.  Total is about 2 pounds.  The extra weight and bulk make my Air feel like the iPad 1.All of these factors make me drop a star for this case which is still very suitable for many environments.I'd use this when at a trade show or other harsh environment where the Big Bang protects the air from abuse and its stand offers multiple angles securely, unlike the unstable vertical position with an Apple Smart Cover.  But on a day to day basis, try as I did, I just hated the weight,  bulk and tactile feel of the Big Bang and prefer myBelkin Shield Sheer Matte Case \/ Cover for iPad Air (iPad 5) (Smoke)which only weights 2.5 ounces and my AppleiPad Air Smart Cover - Blackwhich weights less than 4 ounces.  Total is more than 8 ounces lighter than the Big Bang and feels great in my hand.","rating":4},{"comment":"The Logitech Big Bang Impact Protective Thin and Light Case for iPad Air, Forged Graphite is a very solid case. It is very well made and protects your device very well. It has a great feel to it and is comfortable to handle.It is able to be positioned in a good variety of ways and just gives the feel of protection. The price might seem high but it really is a quality item.I have several Logictech products and have been pleased with them. This is another of their items I find to be well made and very good at what it was designed to do.","rating":4},{"comment":"Shock proof case features multiple viewing angles and built in openings for peripherals. It's thin and light. I didn't risk  dropping the iPad itself but the case survived a drop. Downside is it doesn't hold a keyboard so unless you are only looking for a stand or cover. this isn't for you. The auto wake and auto sleep function worked as expected. Recommended unless you use a keyboard.","rating":4},{"comment":"If you look through my reviews you will see that I've been through roughly a dozen iPad air cases.  Some with keyboards, some without.  Some by Kensington, some by Logitech and some from no-name Chinese outlets.  This is the first one I've left on my iPad Air for over a few weeks.It isn't perfect.  But it is pretty good.  First off - protection.  The case is VERY good in this area and protects the sides of the iPad very well.  I would imagine that this would protect your iPad in MOST falls.The case looks nice, and feels nice.  Unlike some cases I have tried, the magnetic flap doesn't beat the screen to death. In fact, there is no magnetic clasp hanging off of the case.  It simply closes and the magnet holds it closed.This case does use the magnetic lock that turns on the screen.  I find that even moving it a little turns the iPad on, probably wasting battery life.  That would be one of the down sides of this case.It also doesn't prop up well, certainly not any better than the many other cases I have tried.  Like most of them, the indentations aren't deep enough to really prop the iPad up for angled viewing.  Another downside of the case.So why do I give it five stars?  It is simply the first case I have found so far that works well enough for me to keep it.  It doesn't do anything particularly amazingly, but it does most everything well enough and most importantly, it doesn't do anything so bad that it becomes a deal breaker.I know that doesn't sound like a sales pitch, and I'm not trying to pitch this case.  I'm just saying that I've tried a lot of cases and so many of them had fatal flaws that forced me to abandon them after a short time.  The Logitcech Big Bang Impact Protective Thin and LIght Case of the iPad air doesn't have any fatal flaws for me and it works well, so I'd suggest that it is worth a try to anyone who has tried a variety of cases and hasn't found a keeper yet.  Perhaps it will be the answer for you as well.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is an excellent option for those out there seeking a sleek look that also provides ample protection. The Logitech Big Bang Impact Protective case is definitely a nice looking case for the iPad. I love how it feels in my hand and that is a big part of the sale for someone like myself who hates slippery cases that seem to glide around when being held. This feels stable in my hands...which is important since I am incredibly klutzy.This case actually saved my iPad during a somewhat scary fall from my bed. It fell from about 4 feet onto my wood floor and I was pretty worried there would be SOME damage but NADA! Pristine condition! This does the job. It provides both the look and the protection that I want in a case. The price is a bit steep though. I think this would be better suited to a 50 dollar price range.Overall, great case. Saved my device from a pretty noticeable fall and that's the most important aspect!","rating":4},{"comment":"This case is truly childproof and lightweight enough to complement the iPad air without taking anything from the tablet stylish design.The quality of the materials is made with can be easily confirmed simply by holding it and taking a look. It's not only sturdy, it has shock absorbent material in the back to protect the screen from a direct impact and all around the case to protect it from a side drop.One thing I found interesting, it's that this shock absorbent material is flexible, unlike other cases where there is only rigid plastic to cushion the tablet from any hard surface it might land on. The outside part of the cover is liquid repellant and simple to wipe, and it resists scratches too.I also like the feature that wakes the tablet when one opens the case, and puts it to sleep when one closes it. The stand gives the option of placing the tablet in a few different viewing angles, depending of what we're doing with the iPad at the moment, which is really convenient.And of course, it includes custom openings for the camera, microphone and the Lighting connector.","rating":5},{"comment":"The XPS X8700 is a nice PC.  I prefer Windows 7 to Windows 8 so I was glad this came with Win7 (64-bit Home Premium edition).The specs are an Intel i7 3.6 GHz processor,  1 TB hard drive, and 8 GB memory.The CPU is listed as 22.52&#8221; x &#8220;14.49&#8221; x 20.94&#8221;.  It is technically a mini-tower, at just 16&#8221; tall standing.Features include 6 USB 3.0 ports, 4 USB 2.0 ports, and built in WiFi 802.11A\/B\/G\/N (The PC contains a Dell Wireless-N 1703 card).  The card will handle Blue-tooth connectivity as well.  The PC also includes a 16x CD\/DVD-RW drive and an internal fax modem.  I like having the fax modem for those occasions when I need to send\/receive a fax with someone who has no other way to send\/receive paperwork.Graphics are handled through  1 GB Vidia GeForce 720 video card.  Audio is driven by HD 7.1 &#8220;Performance&#8221; audio with Waves MaxxAudio.  For a PC, it is really good sound.Overall processing and video is quite nice and everything feels a little snappier than my Dell 7010 (Intel i5).Dell&#8217;s &#8220;19 in 1&#8221; media card reader is a nice, easy to use feature.  I had a poor success rate with these on older SPX models a few years back, where I had to keep reseating the device on the motherboard as it would stop talking to the PC. But thus far that issue seems to be gone on this model.Ethernet port, HDMI, and audio jacks are resident, and a wired mouse and keyboard are included.It is easy to set up, very little to configure, except the fax modem and wifi (if you use it), and there is nothing on it in the way of ugly, trial software which continues to pop up for weeks.  It does come with a trial of Office.  So, just connect your perhipherals, printers, etc. Add it to your network, then install whatever software you use, make sure to add some sort of anti-virus\/malware protection (I often go with AVG and MalWareBytes) and you should be good to go.I strongly recommend conencting to Windows Update and checking for any patches, updates, etc.  This will ensure you have all teh required updates for your OS, drivers, and so on.Dell provides a 1 year in home warranty.The system performs very nicely, and I was able to connect easily to my home wifi (FIOS), although I tend to connect my desktop on a hard wire, for optimum speed.  I haven&#8217;t run into any issues.  I had one printer I can no longer use, but that because it is older and has no suitable 64 bit driver.Overall this is a nice PC and I would look into it if you want a new desktop with some good power.  It has good processing power, a nice array of features, ports, etc. and thus far has been a good, stable box.","rating":5},{"comment":"My new Dell computer arrived yesterday.  Its a little old school in that its a largish tower, as opposed to a sleek lil tablet or laptop.  But it reminds me why towers were good in that it is fast, powerful and a lot of work, play, ideas and dreams will be writ large on its hard drive for years to come.I have had one good experience in my life with a Dell, in a company laptop some fifteen years ago worked well and when it was time to retire it, it was only in favor of a newer, more powerful computer (which in retrospect seems like a silly idea for what was then a laptop computer mostly running spreadsheets).  That laptop was dependable and quick.  But it was my company's computer and when they made the decision that it was time to change up...I have put the computer through a number of tests, but they are not the sort of tests a professional might run.  I don't know how fast the hard drive runs (though I could probably figure out a why to find it...yes I know, it says 7200 RPM in the literature on the computer but that doesn't mean it really runs that fast).  I don't know how many mega anything are doing anything to anything.  What I do know is that I put the computer through its paces, showing video (fast, beautiful and able to keep multiple windows running 1080 video alive at the same time). I put a graphics intensive game (Skyrim!) on, set it for its meanest, hardest graphics settings and, expecting lag, found none whatsoever.  I downloaded, cross referenced, opened up a couple of large spreadsheets.  Basically I did most of what I do normally that eats up computer resources and this new Dell took it all and asked for more.For more specific things that I liked:Surprised and VERY pleased that I found a new computer running Win 7. Win 8 is, IMHO, for the birds.The many many usb ports on the top and back.The assortment slots for various sized memory cardsLike the internal fax modem, though I haven't tested it yetFor things that could be improvedThe keyboard is very basic and wired.  Not Bluetooth.The mouse (Lasermouse!) seems fine, if a little basic.  Also wired, not BluetoothThe size of the case is a little intimidating...I may have to buy some longer cables to get the box off the desk and onto the floorSetup went very simply, answered a number of questions, setup the wifi for the modem and I was in.  It was literally as simple as connect a few wires (maybe 5 of them) and the computer was waiting.These suggestions are trifling things.  I wanted a computer, I can go get the mouse and keyboard I want.  In short, VERY pleased with it, and I'm looking forward to a long happy time computing, working and playing.  All in, very much a win.","rating":5},{"comment":"It does not come with a monitor, in case you missed that detail.  But it quickly recognizes both old and new monitors and Smart TVs.  The first other electronic it recognized was my Samsung Smart TV positioned about 20' away.  What I wired it to--just to see if it would work--was a large and bulky LED, 12 year old, NEC MultiSync.Plus this is a really classy-looking tower, with its shiny and slight angled-back front panel.  Okay, so a good looking tower is a \"by-the-way\".  But, actually, if you will be looking at this tower daily for.....how many years to come?.....then \"nice looking\" is a consideration, right?And it is loaded with Windows 7, not the \"evil\" Windows 8.  So, there you go:  You Windows 7 fans can have your cake and eat it too! ......Unless you are a Windows 8 user, like I am.  I am finding it very hard to go back to Windows 7, (and have realized that I prefer Windows 8).So, back to the innards:  With an Intel i7 processor, your most sophisticated software programs will speed along and never hang up, thinking...thinking...thinking....  So will your most involved, intricate and fat games.  And, can you find more storage?  I'm sure the techies can, but for the rest of us, 1 TB should give you enough storage for whatever your heart desires for the next how many years.  It has HUGE space to store your stuff.I like the convenient placement of the USB ports (six USB 3.0, four USB 2.0):  They are located on the back of the tower, on the top (two USB 3.0) and on the front (two USB 3.0).  (You can tell the 3.0 ports by the blue plastic inside.)I think you are paying for the tower here.  I think Dell has tossed in the keyboard and the wired mouse for convenience, because they are adequate, but if you are really serious about your mouse and keyboard comfort, you will be changing them out sooner than later.  But at least these accessories will get you going.Be aware that there is very little paperwork inside the box:  Just a Quick Start Guide and the warranty information, and you will have to start up the computer before you can refer to any details.  If you feel that you are computer illiterate, I assure you that set up is simple and common-sense:  Just pair the plugs on the cords to the ports on the back of the tower; you can't go wrong.I am going to add some of my own personal thoughts here:  Take them or leave them:  I'm not stating fact, just my personal thinking, and I'm not looking for a debate.  (Sure, I'm up for a decent discussion that can help me learn more.)  Before picking up this tower, I already had two Toshiba KIRA laptops, one i5 and one i7.  I love both of them and I appreciate their Intel processors.  I also have an ASUS P1801 Transformer (it's both a PC and a tablet, with its 18.4\" monitor playing both games).  They all have touch screens and run Windows 8.I got used to Windows 8 and now I find I don't like going back to Windows 7.  So, consider that before buying this tower--it does run Windows 7 (with Service Pack 1 installed).  I also got used to a touch screen, and going back to a regular screen is almost more than I can take.  The monitor I've temporarily paired with this tower is an older NEC MultiSync 2010X XtraView LCD (that I've kept because it was just so cool when I bought it back when (and so expensive).  While I'm happy to report that I had no trouble at all pairing this sophisticated tower with an older monitor, I'm also vowing to give the monitor to Goodwill and get a new, big touchscreen in addition to using it with my Samsung TV.  (But, I think it is good to know that older monitors work with this tower.)And, when you are comparing the offerings on this product page, do not forget that 1 TB storage = 1024 GB.  So, don't be fooled into thinking 1 TB is bigger and better than 1024 GB; it's just two different companies using different terminology.....","rating":5},{"comment":"This PC is a very good purchase at it's price point.

The system was very easy to set up using my older Dell monitor, Canon Printer and speakers. The computer comes with a keyboard and mouse along with all the necessary adapters to get it up and going. It runs quickly with the built in wireless component without the hassle of setting up a Linksys or similar network connection. The front and top of  the tower each has a total of four USB outlets which I though was great to charge  my Garmin watch, iPhone and iPod shuffle at the same time. It also allows me to sync all three item simultaneously while I work on my computer. Also on top of the tower you have a microphone port, head phone port and accessory tray to place your items while they charge and sync. In the front of the unit you have a driver for a CD\/DVD and two media card reader ports. There are so many bell and whistles on this unit that will make any tech savvy user extremely happy. I would highly recommend the Dell XPS.","rating":5},{"comment":"Worst tech support I have ever encountered.

The programs load much faster and start faster.  Installing my word processor only took about 1\/2 as long. It simple flies.You can see from the pictures the front and top of the case and its connections. There is room in the front for another disk drive.  For some reason there is no picture of the back, but it is the same as is pictured on the pages for the lower priced models, with the additional 6 USB ports, room for 3 expansion cards and a little brace that acts as a plug protector.I'm using the same video card in another computer. It has a lot of bang for the buck. I have folders with 1000's of images and the thumbnails display immediately for all of them. This Dell handles all my CorelDraw files as well as can be expected when using an old program on a new operating system. Data is saved to the hard drive very fast. The disk drive is not very noisy. It all works great.The Windows 8.1 takes about twice as long to boot as 8.0, about 25 seconds instead of 12. I don't know if that is because of Windows or Dell. It's still faster than 7.0. It's also nice to be able to boot to the desktop and 8.1 is a big improvement.","rating":5},{"comment":"It is generally hard to review a computer because a computer buying decision is generally made by the specs on the computer.  As such, I will try and use this review to provide information that is generally not available from just looking at the specs on this machine.Power Supply: One of the responses to the question above about the power supply on this computer said that it had a 300 watt supply.  I opened the case on the computer and it said that it has 460 watts max.  As I was able to install a Radeon 6850 video card without upgrading the power supply, I do not see how there could be a 300 watt power supply on this thing.Bloatware: Many pre-built computers have a lot of unnecessary bloatware installed on them in order to try and have you purchase additional software.  Generally this bloatware can significantly reduce the speed at which the computer operates.  I have even purchased a computer that had the hard drive partitioned with software on the partition that the company wanted you to buy.  That is not the case with this computer.  There is very little additional software installed on the computer that would not have otherwise come with windows 8.1.  There is an icon to install Microsoft Office icon (You have to pay for it if you want to install it).  In addition, Cyberlink media suite essentials is installed.  You have the option to use the basic version of it, or to upgrade it to the Pro version.  Cyberlink can be useful for watching DVDs on your computer.  It is a decent program to have.Video Card:The computer is installed with a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 745 4GB DDR3.  Apparently this card is a &#34;high efficiency&#34; card that is only used in pre-built systems.  Will it play games? Yes, it is a pretty decent card.  I swapped the card out for my prior Radeon 6850, which was a $150 card about 2-3 years ago.  The 6850 outperforms the video card that the Dell comes with.Gaming: Prior to changing the video card, I played a few games on it.  Guild Wars 2 was handled fairly well.  With the game set on the highest setting I was getting about 20fps, which is a little low. (This was bumped up to about 40fps with the new video card.) Set on medium the game played very smoothly.  I was also able to play Skyrim on nearly maxed out settings.  Please note, it is my understanding that both of these games rely heavily on the CPU as opposed to some other games which rely more heavily on the Graphics Card and this computer has an amazing CPU.Setup: Setup was very quick and easy to do, I think most people should be able to handle the setup of this computer, even if you are not very computer literate.  I had intended to describe the setup process, but honestly, it was so quick and easy, that I cannot even remember what I had to do.Small quirk: There is a little, but powerful orange LED inside the computer that stays on all the time that the computer is plugged in.  It will even stay on for about a minute after the computer is unplugged.  As I have the computer in my bedroom it is fairly noticeable at night time.Overall, if you are looking for a higher powered pre-built system, I would highly recommend this computer, it will handle pretty much everything you can throw at it (with the exception of some high end games, set to the highest settings, with multiple monitors).","rating":5},{"comment":"Setup: stunningly easy.

HOWEVER, as also said by others, it might be time for me to move on already. So, while it pulls me a little out of my comfort zone, it may be about time!Gaming: WOW! I didn't believe that I would notice that great of a difference from my previous computer. I was so wrong!! I see a fluidity here that I did not in my other system. Really amazing! Now, I did need to update the drivers on this computer in order to play WoW, but you WANT to update the drivers (and it takes you no time to do so). So, if you game and receive the notification that your drivers require updating, please do not stress. Updating the drivers is necessary (and is no big deal). (You probably already know this, but if this is your first big investment in a desktop, I thought I'd just let you know so that you do not worry about your purchase choice).Peripherals: Okay, I'm just going to be frank with you ... these are pretty bad. The mouse is crazy light, insanely glossy (which means it will attract fingerprints), and offers no customization. For me, it is unusable (it went in our \"junk box\" just in case we need a spare one in an emergency). I moved my Logitech G500s over with no problem. The same applies to the keyboard. That went in the same box and I moved my Corsair Raptor over. BUT, if you are purchasing a desktop of this caliber, you probably have your favorite \"toys\" (like me) and will merely transfer them. I, obviously did not drop the star-rating for this BUT I do view it as a little wasteful on Dell's part. Including these in some desktops might make sense, but here, I do not think anyone will use them.Other \"stuff\": The dish-like groove on the top is perfect for housing my external hard-drive. When not using that, I have the cups of my headset resting there ... and the USB port in the front is perfect for these since my SteelSeries headset has a wildly short cord (for reasons I never understood).I have given this a massive workout over the last week. I have not spotted a single problem. There is literally nothing I would change, not even Windows 8 (which has been growing on me over the days). Know that I am demanding and all too \"picky.\" I can find a problem with everything ... I guess I am hypercritical by nature. There is NOTHING here that I dislike (anything that I did not love, I had already modified).Is this desktop worth the hype? You bet it is.","rating":5},{"comment":"The external case of this desktop has been well designed. I've had desktops that were cumbersome to use, with odd tray and button placement that annoyed me enough to swap them out. The XPS X8700-3130BLK has had thought put into the user experience and it shows. The charging well on the top has two USB ports for easy connection of cameras, phones, etc and a small cradle area to help hold them. These are not the only USB ports of the system, there are a ridiculous amount (ten total, six of them USB 3). I'm used to having to use one or two USB hubs to attach all my peripherals (sketch tablet, hard drives, Kindle, printer, etc) but I was able to connect everything directly. There are hubs front and back, so I don't feel overwhelmed by wires.It ships with Windows 8, which I'm not fan of. You can set it to act like your window's phone (which it works beautifully with) but without a touch screen monitor that interface is fairly useless. There's the usual amount of bloatware to wade through and clean out, but even before I started customizing the speed was closer to what I expect from a Mac. Video processing, rendering, all were much smoother and quicker than I expected. This is a real workhorse.While the peripherals are nothing special, they are functional. You'll want to replace the mouse but the very lightweight keyboard is fine. This system is exceptionally quiet - I had it running in my bedroom without any disturbance. It's nice to find an attractive machine that performs, as I've often had to choose between looks and utility. Very happy with this unit.","rating":5},{"comment":"Here's a few thoughts on the Dell XPS X8700.Windows 8- I must admit, I purposely tried to avoid Windows 8.  It's just not my thing and I don't think it makes much sense for desktop computers, even if you do own a touch screen.  The first thing we did when we received this was call Dell to see if they could tell us how to downgrade to Windows 7.  After a lot of back and forth, we finally were told that it wasn't possible to do that by a technician.  So, once that was settled, we tested this with programs that we traditionally use.Mouse and Keyboard- The mouse and keyboard supplied in this kit are light.  There's nothing special about them and you might want to consider upgrading to better pieces later.  They work for the moment, though.Gaming- We tested this with a number of games that varied in size.  They all worked wonderfully, including one rather tricky game that is largely unplayable with other video cards. All in all, this system hasn't failed me yet in terms of game play.Set Up- Set up was surprisingly simple.Speed\/Programs- We tested this with a number of Adobe programs, which can easily slow down a computer and work sluggishly if your computer isn't up to speed, but none of them gave us any trouble.  That's a huge plus in my book.Overall, I am liking this tower!  It's been a long time since I have owned a Windows based desktop and they seem to have gotten better since my last run around with them.","rating":4},{"comment":"I love this Dell XPS. I have been playing Battlefield and a few other games on it, and don't have a single complaint. Super super easy to run through set up, it is very self explanatory. This computer is a powerhouse. The graphics card is perfect for me and it runs smooth so far. But there is plenty of room for expansion for those of you that want even more of an upgrade. It has plenty of USB ports, which I'm so thankful for because I've got a couple external hard drives I constantly have to plug in simultaneously for work. There are a couple in the back and in the front. I have dual screen monitors hooked up to it and I'm constantly running some heavy programs at the same time with no issues whatsoever. Also, while I'm talking about programs- I've installed all my programs from my previous computer, no problem. Not sure if I'm a huge fan of Windows 8, but I'm thinking it is just going to take some getting used to.It's been a little over a month, so only time will tell how it keeps up, but I'll update my review if anything negative happens. So far though, I'm so happy with this beast.","rating":5},{"comment":"This machine is a true powerhouse: it comes with the 3.6GHz i7-4790 processor (near the absolute top of the line for Intel processors), 16GB of DDR3-RAM, and a 2TB hard disk (7200 RPM SATA), on-board gigabit ethernet, 10 USB ports (4 USB2.0 and 6 USB3.0 ports), an HDMI port, a muti-card reader, plus the usual DVI and VGA outputs, as well as audio outputs. It even includes wireless b\/g\/n card  (which is very nice, but I don't need it).  This is a machine for gamers and for those who need serious compute power.Two of the USB2.0 ports are in the back.  Use those for your keyboard and mouse, which are low speed devices.  There is a convenient accessory tray at the top with two more USB2.0 ports, one of which can be used to charge your smart phone.  Connect your high speed external hard drives to the USB3.0 ports in the back for better speed, but you also have two front ones for convenience for temporary connections.  There is a dedicated display port in the back too, but I personally prefer to use HDMI.  The computer comes with four unused expansion slots for PCIe cards.  If you are a gamer, and if you want to add a very high power graphics card (or two) you have room for it.When I started up the machine everything worked immediately.  The set up was easy and straightforward.  It immediately detected all other computers and printers on my home network without prompting.  Then I installed a few programs I need, including disk partitioning software.  (The Windows 8.1.1 comes with its own disk partitioning software, but it does not deal with Linux partitions.)  Most PC users do not need disk partitioning, but I do because this will soon become a triple-boot machine with Windows and with two different flavors of Linux.  Even if you do not care about booting other operating systems, you may still want to partition your disk into at least two pieces so that your data and the Windows system software will reside on different partitions.  Doing so makes system upgrades and recoveries and restore points much easier to deal with.  If you don't know what disk partitions are, don't even try this.  But if you know what you are doing, then I highly recommend it on a high-powered machine like this one.You can tell that I am absolutely tickled pink with my new machine.  Isn't there any negatives at all?  Unfortunately yes, but they are not related to the machine itself, but to the OS.  Windows 8.1.1 is a smart-phone and tablet operating system.  But Windows 8.x is not appropriate for high-powered machines in my opinion.  If all you want is to read e-mail, surf the web, check the weather, and watch videos, a tablet will be more than sufficient.  You don't need to buy a powerhouse like this one.  If so, Windows 8.1.1 is really great.  In this case, however, Dell should have offered a Windows-7 downgrade, which would have made this machine even more attractive.  Both Dell and HP occasionally offer Windows-7 downgrades on their very high-end machines, but unfortunately not on this one.  (I guess they are under pressure from Microsoft to migrate everybody to Windows-8, or else ...)  There are ways to make Windows-8 look and act like Windows-7, but they go about 70% to 80% of the way, not 100%.  (Microsoft will claim that Windows-8 can do everything Windows-7 can do, and I am sure they are correct, but finding every little thing one needs is made extremely difficult under Windows-8.)Despite the lack of Windows-7 downgrade, I will rate this machine 5-stars.  It is that good!","rating":5},{"comment":"It's pretty cheaply made, the processor is incredibly slow but you get what you paid for..

You could charge it with a USB wall charger, USB car charger or by connecting it to a USB port on your computer. You can continue to play on it while it's charging if you wish. It has a 4 hour battery life on this which is shorter than I am used to but I am not going to use it for more than 4 hours in one day so it really doesn't make much difference.The screen on the tablet is 7 inches measured diagonally and the tablet inside is standard. What makes this tablet kid friendly is the special thick silicone shell that encases this tablet. It covers the entire back and side of the tablet and around the edges of the front as well. It's about 1\/4 of an inch thick so it can really protect the tablet from minor falls and bumps quite well. It should still be protected even if it's dropped on it's front because the silicone shell is so thick. The one exception would be if you were to drop it or hit it on something small or sharp that would only hit the screen. In this case the shell wouldn't be able to protect it. I think it provides very good protection from the average drop or bump.The screen on this tablet isn't as high quality as my iPad for example but this tablet costs ten times less than my iPad and the screen is just fine for the price of this tablet in my opinion. The screen resolution is 1024 x 600 which is lower resolution than I am used to. I still looks nice but I can certainly notice the difference. For the price it's not bad at all.You can do all the things with tablet as with any other Android tablet. There are tons of free games that you can download for free on the Amazon App Store. There are new free games daily so even if you don't want to purchase games you can still get many of them for free. Even some of the best games are totally free from time to time. A lot of times when the game first comes out they want to get people taking about it and rating \/ reviewing it so they offer it for free. You can surf the internet with the built-in browser or Google chrome if you wish. You can stream music with Apps like Pandora or stream movies or TV shows with services like Netflix or Hulu Plus. This tablet has built-in Wifi for anyone that is wondering. It also has a lot of goodies already installed like a calculator, clock, email, Skype, Google Play, sound recorder, voice search, news and so much more. It already has wallpapers installed so you can customize the look of your background. It even have active wallpaper that moves. This was a cool feature that my costly iPad doesn't even have.I cam easily download games on this tablet just as quickly as with my iPad. It can be slow sometimes but so can my iPad. This tablet seems to have limited amount of memory and sometimes it will freeze during installation or when a game is loading. It doesn't happen often enough to bother me much though. It has 4GB of built in memory for saving apps, music, video, emails and whatever else you need to store. I think for most kids this would be a sufficient amount of memory but you can expand it if you need to. I love how easy it is to expand the memory because all you have to do is insert a memory card. I wish I could expand the memory on my iPad that way. You can expand the memory on a iPad at all so that option is pretty cool to me.It also has a built-in camera for taking pictures and sending video on Skype or a comparable app. The picture and video isn't amazing but is pretty decent. Keep in mind that this is for younger kids so while most may take pictures I wouldn't think that most would be video chatting on Skype.Overall my feelings about this Android tablet are very positive. Is this a state of the art and top of the line tablet? No. If you want one of those then be prepared to pay about 16 times the cost of this tablet. This tablet is however a very low cost and very decent tablet for the price. This is a easy tablet for me to recommend for a parent that would like a tablet for their child but doesn't have a ton of money to spend.Sample provided for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is not a high-end tablet, you should not compare it to an iPad or any other more expensive tablets.Having said that, it It works great, the protective case is a perfect fit and it allows you to easily control you tablet (on\/off switch, volume control) while protecting you tablet.It has Android 4.0 with Google Store so you can install whatever you want in it. you can use a MicroSD card for expanded memory.It is now super fast but responsive enough, I bought it for my toddler and he enjoys it.

I have tried a number of them, and this is one of the better ones. The unit measures 9 3\/16&#34; x 5 1\/8&#34; x 1\/4&#34; at its thickest point, and weighs in at 6.4 ounces. Unlike other keyboards, it has no provisions for holding the tablet, or being stored as an integrated unit (such as the Logitech).=== The Good Stuff ===* While it is a &#34;small&#34; keyboard, i quickly became used to it and was able to type reasonably error free. I don't know that I would want to type on it all day, but for a few minutes here and there, it is fine. There are all the usual function keys that you would expect (Play, FF, REW, Vol +, Vol -, cut, paste, etc), and it is possible to define more hot keys than you will ever remember.* There are 2 buttons (Off\/On, Connect), and four indicator lights (Caps, Bluetooth, Charge, Power). The bluetooth light only illuminates when the unit is searching for a connection, meaning in its normal operating mode, all power-burning LEDs are turned off.* The keyboard charged in an hour or two, and has lasted for at least two days of somewhat limited typing. The bluetooth connection was quick and worked with no issues, although I seem to need to go back to the Settings\/Bluetooth menu on the iPad every time I want to re-establish a connection. Other than that quirk, the bluetooth connection has been rock-solid, and works from a greater distance than my eyes can handle from the tablet.* The keyboard seems well made, The back is reasonably rigid, and the keys have a nice feel to them, although no click feedback. The keystrokes seem distinct, and it is obvious when you have depressed a key. The four little vinyl bumpers make a big difference, and I would recommend installing them on the rear panel.=== The Not-So-Good Stuff ===* My old Logitech keyboard spoiled me. That keyboard held the tablet in an upright position, and served as a cover for the iPad. Unfortunately it gave up the ghost after only a year of service, so I haven't replaced it.  I do miss the built-in tablet holder.* Reconnecting always seems to require clicking through the settings\/bluetooth menu items on the iPad- not a big deal, but most of my other bluetooth peripherals seem to connect without that step.=== Summary ===I am happy with the unit, and use it as the primary input for my iPad. Typing on this, or any small keyboard is tiring, and I try to limit the amount of time I use them, but other than that I am happy with the keyboards layout and feel.=== Disclaimer ===I received this as a sample direct from the manufacturer. I have no connection with either the manufacturer or any of its employees.","rating":5},{"comment":"I'm a software engineer and have several Bluetooth keyboards. This one is one of my favorites.

It changes the functions of some of the keys. It seems to work well.* The 4 LED lights are nice (well designed). The power LED will go off after 4 seconds, probably to save power.* It includes 4 rubber (or rubber like) feet to stick on the bottom of the keyboard. I wish it included more as I put one in each corner but it flexes a bit in the middle if you press hard enough. It would have been nice to put at least one rubber foot in the middle... but this is really no big deal.* It comes with a nice felt (or felt-like) carrying bag.* I tested it with my Dell Venue 8 Pro (Windows 8.1) and an Andoid smartphone and had no issues.* Claims an uninterrupted working time of about 100 hours and a standby time of over 100 days.I can't really find anything negative to say about this keyboard except for the minor quibble about wanting more rubber feet... so I'm giving it 5 stars.

It was simple to install into my older but still great Antec Twelvehundred case and has met or exceeded all of my expectations with really only two really minor complaint about the drivers and audio.The drivers and related mobo software took nearly 3 hours to install with Windows 8.1.  It was agonizing.  I wish someone had warned me it would take so long.  The longest part seemed to be nearly 1 hour for the Asus cloud software.  But with 5 total reboots and nearly 3 hours it was a big time sink.As for audio this part will be pretty long but my hope is I'm going to save someone else time and frustration.  The mobo comes with the new SupremeFX 2014 branded Realtec audio chipset (based on the high quality 8-channel or 7 speakers +1 subwoofer Realtek ALC1150 codec) has some caveats that the marketing and technical information available from Asus does a poor job in my very humble opinion of conveying.  I suspect anyone using the Optical port would value this information.  But especially anyone who shares my particular situation where I am connecting my new Maximus VII PC to an older ultra-high-end Audio Preprocessor in a home theater to be used as a high-end media system.Before I go into that let me just say that the headphone input from the mobo is outstanding and the ROG Sonic Studio is really quite remarkable.  But keep in mind its using audio tricks to use that functionality.  If all you care about is headphones this is outstanding.  However, to continue my earlier complaint about the audio....My home theater preprocessor (brand is irrelevant) decodes all of the usual formats for mid-2000's including DD, DTS, EX, DTS-ES 6.1, Dolby Prologic II, DTS Neo:6, and is THX Ultra certified.  The ASUS Maximus VII Hero supports both Toslink optical and coaxial (through a multi-purpose 3.5mm audio jack) for digital audio inputs.  After some extensive investigating I'm a little disappointed that the built in S\/PDIF out (the \"toslink optical out\") on the mobo uses DTS Neo:PC (part of the DTS Interactive stream encoder (part of the DTS Connect platform)) compression algorithm.  (From Wikipedia) This is a technology based on the DTS Neo:6 matrix surround technology, which transforms any stereo content (MP3, WMA, CD Audio, or games) into a  ** simulated **  7.1-channel surround sound experience. The 7.1-channel surround sound is output as a DTS stream for output via a S\/PDIF cable port.  So just remember it's only using Stereo sound and uses audio tricks to expand it to 5.1 or 7.1 surround.  I suppose this was a cost-based decision.  But if you want more than stereo chances are you'll have to look at aftermarket solutions.Because my Preprocessor can natively process DTS Neo:6 (which DTS Neo:PC is based on) I'm able to get sound from the Optical port but so far there doesn't appear to be great speaker separation.  I'm going to keep experimenting with DTS Matrix settings.  But so for the most part I get the same sound from 5 speakers.  The only differences in each speaker are when the sound is extremely loud for a particular speaker.  I can play DTS samples (just google for that phrase for good resources online) and I can hear things like rockets flying from back to front.  But most voices especially from movies and music come out of all channels which is a little annoying.July 8 2014 Update:  I confirm that I was able to get better sound by setting my Preprocessor to DTS-ES 6.1 (the Preprocessor onscreen display called it DTS Matrix).  I got better concrete speaker separation.  I've never actually listened to music from this format before.  The voices and certain middle range sounds were coming from the center channel which was a little strange.  Again DTS Neo:PC is not fully compatible apparently with DTS-ES.  But this seems like my best compromise using the toslink optical connection.I wish ASUS would have provided PCM support for the optical output.  This would have greatly simplified device compatibility by eliminating any fussy encoding or decoding formats.  I've read forum posts about whether PCM was or wasn't an option and some claiming there wasn't enough bandwidth is just uninformed.  Even cheap DVD players provide PCM support using the lowest quality components without any problems.  This should have just added pennies if any costs to the mobo.  I've contacted ASUS to request PCM support but I won't hold my breath.There may still be another option.  ASUS doesn't do a great job of calling this out nor do any of the reviews I could find; but the Maximus VII Hero also comes with six 3.5mm audio jacks on the rear panel.  These are analog audio outputs (with one exception, one of these 3.5mm audio jacks also serves as an HD Audio out channel.)  These 3.5mm audio jacks are for analog audio output to be connected to a preprocessor for handling high-end analog formats like SACD and DVD-Audio.  These are called Multichannel or Multichannel: 7.1.  Just make sure you're using 3.5mm connectors on your cables to whatever inputs (RCA) on your preprocessor.  And also remember as with any analog cable they're much more susceptible to noise and EM interference which at the back of a PC motherboard seems pretty high.

Be very careful about using RAM from Asus' QVL.  I purchased Corsair RAM from their approved list, and I am having problems booting up.  The build will start, then immediately shut down and start up again.  I've been told it might be the RAM, even though the RAM is on their list.  (It might be that the &#34;Revision No&#34; of the RAM is not on their list, but how in the world can we as consumers know which RAM revision we are buying?Also, in my opinion, the BIOS programs appear to be untested and not ready for consumer use.  I enabled ErP and the on-board LAN would not work, even after disabling the ErP afterwards and trying a System Restore.  I had to reinstall Windows 7.  It also caused problems with the sound controller which appeared to cause my speakers to stop working.Still troubleshooting problems - the RAM issue is an annoyance, but it does boot and function after the gyrations when starting.Never had so many issues with a build.  I have always used Asus boards, but this one has me rethinking that.","rating":2},{"comment":"Love this, it's gorgeous and fast as hell.Running with a i7-4770k and it works great, waiting to get my i7-4790k next week and gonna drop it in.

Based on past experience, ASUS has never let me down, so I looked through their Z97 lineup.I got this motherboard for the rich feature set, dual intelligent processors, 8 SATA ports, lots of USB 3.0, multiple PCI-e expansion slots, and Z97 chipset (looking towards better integrated graphics in the 14 nm processors coming out later this year, which this board is supposed to support). I'm having no trouble with any of the features. This BIOS is packed with many tweaking options but also makes overclocking easy, if that's your game. I was interested in proper control of the case and CPU fans and this motherboard allows fine-grained control of 4 case and 2 CPU fans (compatible with 3 and 4-pin fans) from the BIOS itself - important if you want quiet performance in a HTPC. I was particularly impressed with the fan calibration feature included in the bios, that can automatcially detect the lowest fan speed possible. You can also turn off bells and whistles like the red LEDs, if desired.The included software is pretty good too. I like the RAM disk utility that offers mapping \/ synchronization with a folder. The dual intelligent processor utility is well-designed and gives good real time fan and temperature info. It makes overclocking the CPU and GPU simple.Installation was painless as the board is laid out well and doesn't cause issues with cable routing. I used a Noctua low profile cpu cooler that is quite wide but this board doesn't have tall heatsinks or other annoyances which limit your cooling options. I particularly liked the little adapter ASUS provides to make hooking up the front panel connections easier. The rear I\/O panel has soft cushions and is of high build quality. Right angle and straight SATA connectors are included. It's the nice touches like this that keep me brand-loyal.The SATA3 ports seem to deliver as promised - I get 450 Mb\/sec from a Samsung 840 SSD. The dual intelligent processors automatically bump my core i7 4770S to 3.9 GHz, no separate overclock needed. I can run low voltage (1.35V) crucial ballistix RAM with great timings (8-8-8-24, 1T) at 1600 MHz without issue - not all motherboards can handle low voltage ram at these timings and clock speeds - a boon for HTPC builds where low latency and low power matter more than clock speed.As before, this board raises my confidence in ASUS products and I would highly recommend it.","rating":5},{"comment":"This motherboard fulfills all my needs for gaming","rating":5},{"comment":"Was a little leery to try the latest and greatest of technology when building a new desktop for myself.

The board doesn&#8217;t look cheap and it&#8217;s not too light, you will not have to worry about breaking it while e.g. installing cooler.Speaking about performance, I tried it with two processors (4660k and 4570) and two different cards GTX 750 and GTX 770 together with Corsair Vengeance RAM and it worked stable RUNNING Windows 7 and without any problems encountered.The most pleasant surprise is new UEFI BIOS which leads users through series of questions to most recommended clock setting in order to tune your system to the optimal value providing interface more pleasing to the eye.Given all the above, ASUS Z97-A is a board that can be recommend due to numerous reasons and useful features even for the most demanding users.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have used ASUS motherboards for a long time. Each time either it is a Workstation, Premium or Deluxe variant of the given chipset.  Since I never required two Ethernet ports, built-in Wifi and too many expansion slots. So this time I decided that let me go with simply Z97 board minus the frills but with 8-phase power for stable system even with overclocking as must.This Asus z97-A perfectly fits the needs with great value pricing.  It has the ASUS famous 5-way optimization and other valued added features that are part of the higher offerings but fewer expansion slots, one Ethernet port and no wifi. Hence the cost benefits.The specs of my newly built rigs are:ASUS z97-A motherboardIntel core i5-4570 processorSapphire R9 270X, 2GB DDR5 with OC versionCorsair Vengeance Pro series 1866MHz 16GB kitCrucial M500 SSD 120GB boot drive (many other HDDs as well)Thermaltake 750W PSCorsair mini ATX casingWindows 8.1 and all my softwares installed with every single patch and updates without any single issue. The system is very responsive and a pleasure to use.  I did not OC it so far. The UEFI BIOS seems very nice generally and feature loaded for OC.I did not used the advertised Crystal Sound as I put my old Audigy 2 X sound card in it.The motherboard performed as it is advertised and the built quality is top class that always goes with ASUS. I highly recommend this MB to anyone looking not to compromise on performance and quality but like to save some bucks.My only reason for a four star rating is the MB came with just 3 GATA 6 cables and one header for connecting chassis connectors. May be this is to save cost but how much the company would save on it?

There was a huge scratch on the round sata controller cover. The manual cover was bent. Now...I don't know if this is just bad quality control form Asus or mishandling during packaging or shipping. I strongly suspect that the board was previously opened and  (or)  could be a returned (used) motherboard. In any case, I had to return the motherboard.

Of the last 12 years, I've personally owned many motherboards from Abit, Asus, MSI, Gigabyte, and DFI. Two of those brands are now defunct, but Asus has always been the board of choice for me. Starting last year, I've built a htpc based around an MSI z87-g43 that was just a get the job done board and my personal PC using an Asus Z87-Plus. The Asus Z87-plus has been an amazing experience. It's AI Suite for setting power management, and fan control is excellent, and after having my i7 4770k overclocked to 4.6Ghz without a single hiccup for the past 7 months reminded me why I love Asus Boards.This board was purchased for my girlfriend's new pc. I haven't received the cpu yet for it, but I do have the rest of the parts laying around. I pulled the 4770k from my z87 pc and bench-tested this new board just to verify everything's good. Immediately I was surprised.The new EFI BIOS is extremely well laid out. The first page tells you everything you need to know clearly. It's evolved from prior Asus EFI bios to a much nicer looking, more intuitive interface. The Advanced Mode still gives you all of the good old overclocking settings, but the best part is the refined EZ Tuning Wizard. In a step by step guide it asks you what type of applications you'll use your system for, then it goes to ask if your cooler is a standard hsf, &#34;tower&#34; hsf, or waterblock. After answering those questions, it informs you of a &#34;target&#34; clock and proceeds to tune your system. The waterblock settings provide a 30% overclock attempt to bring a 4770k to 4.5Ghz, which my chip does easily. Temperatures still seemed pretty good, and I do love how the Hardware Monitor keeps a plane on the right side of the Advanced window. As for more tuning, That will have to wait for later when I get the new chip and have my girlfriend build the computer herself since it's her machine.As for layout, this thing's a beauty where pics do no justice! Some Z87-A and Z87-Plus owners complained how the right hand side of the board is a little flimsy when installed because those boards are a little too short to reach the right most standoffs. This board is about a 1\/2&#34; longer allowing the board to be mounted and supported by the standoffs. Awesome implementation since that will provide more support for the EATX power connector.CPU VRM  is still an 8-phase setup when compared to the Z87-A, and identical to my Z87-Plus. That should still provide plenty of overclocking headroom on 4670k and 4770K cpus. I have little doubt this will overclock identical to my Z87 if not better.RAM VRM appears to be a 2+1 phase design. The inductors are a good deal larger than what's on the Z87-plus, also the circuit does have a couple additional capacitors for the additional phase that's missing from the z87 parts. I would imagine this will allow wonderful Ram or BCLK headroom for overclocking!Audio is powered by the ALC892 still. I'm not a fan of onboard audio on motherboards since there's often a significant amount of noise induced. Asus tackled the issues by implementing 4 nicicon capacitors, an EMI shield over the ALC892 chip, thicker traces and implemented a Ti OP amp that's pretty far away from any ic on the board. I'm sure it's a step in the right direction, and honestly, it isn't a bad audio processor. Yes it's old, doesn't do that sound blaster cinema or all of the new features, but who really cares? They spent some time on improving a tried and true design, and more importantly, You still have an optical out to use for your DAC if you so choose. I'm happy with that.Overall, this is a great level of refinement and improvement over prior Asus z87 boards. The Intel NIC, M.2 slot, SATA Express, improved UEFI BIOS, improved RAM VRM, and other features I'm sure I'll soon discover makes this an excellent choice for most haswell builds. Honestly, I'm thinking about swapping my board in my case for this one and hope my gf doesn't notice. Sure it's not an ROG board, but how many people actually gain any benefit from additional phases on haswell since it's a crapshoot with the integrated VRM and crappy TIM under the heat spreader? Almost nil unless you have a cherry-picked Engineering Sample chip. In that respect, buy this board, you'll be happy.","rating":5},{"comment":"This board is excellent. 4790k processor, Noctua NH-U12 S cooler and 32GB Corsair Dominator 2133MHz memory","rating":5},{"comment":"GREAT!!!!!

I have always been impressed with Acer computers. Build quality is an &#34;A&#34;. Performance is good for what it is. The price.. nothing out there is better at this price. What I noticed mainly is the battery. The battery is built-in. You do not see it at all and can't change it unless you open up the laptop. Them being lipo batteries now, smaller and lighter, they have a longer life now and wont need changing for years to come. At this price, i'll deal with that. And the run time for this battery is also a mind blowing 6hrs on high performance settings. Most laptops only get 3hrs. Also this laptop is really thin! I love that. It has no optical drive but who really needs that theses days anyway. This saves weight as well as battery life. Just use a USB stick\/hard drive to backup your Win8. So far i've found no negatives with this laptop. I love the rear ports as well. Most laptops force you to have everything sticking and poking out the sides. This laptop is perfect for net browsing, movies and light online games. Don't expect a $250 laptop ( my price ) to run full blown max graphic games. So in short, this Acer comes highly recommended by me. Buy it!","rating":5},{"comment":"Acer has very bad technical support on this low-end laptop. The first time I contacted them, a staff asked me to register the laptop as soon as possible so the warranty could start immediately. However based on my previous experience with Dell and Toshiba, laptop's warranty should start immediately as the seller shipped out the laptop the buyer. After registration, the staff transferred me to another higher level staff since the staff had no knowledge on RAM upgrade.This laptop has very low specs so it's cheap and needs to be upgraded for better performance. You certainly can buy parts from Amazon for best prices and upgrade RAM on your own to make the laptop to perform like an at least $500 laptop.However the technical support staff said Acer would not upgrade RAM unless the laptop stopped working within one-year warranty and asked me to ship back to Amazon for further upgrades. This was certainly a joke!

Called tech support and after they had me try several things they said send it back to Amazon.  Since Amazon did not have any more available at that time to replace it I ordered a Z97 Pro.NOTE:  After the replacement Z97 was installed and would not boot either Azus told me to ship it back to Amazon for replacement.  So  before I received the third motherboard I did a power check on my new  Corsair 650 power supply and found pin 4 & 6 did not have any voltage output.

Fit and finish are excellent, and it's very attractive.Very slim and lightweight; excellent display resolution; sensitive keys; bright and wide display. Very fast startup, at least with the minimal programs included with the unit. The first time I used it to log onto Dell's website it downloaded a free facial recognition program which allows the user to log on by the onboard camera scanning the face instead of typing in a password. It works well enough.Touch screen response in addition to touchpad and keyboard. Windows 8.1 OS. Intel Core i7 processor (the latest and greatest); 8 gigs of RAM (more than the minimum required to operate this unit, so it makes it QUICK when coupled with the i7 CPU). Responsive touchpad right where you'd expect it. A full terabyte of storage.Really, really nice.Now for the \"BUT...\":NO OPTICAL DRIVE???? Really?I deducted one whole star just for that alone. You can't play or record or use any kind of disc. Not DVD, not CD, not Blu-Ray.I do a LOT of photography, both stills and video, which I then edit and turn into home movies (with menus) on DVD, and still photo DVD or CD \"albums\" which others can then watch on their own TVs. Well, no can do on this computer because it doesn't have an optical drive. No way to create or share those productions with anyone.Yeah, yeah, yeah... I know the latest \"great thing\" is that we're all supposed to store everything on \"the cloud\". Well, first of all, I have zero interest in storing all my personal stuff on some \"cloud\" somewhere where I don't know WHO can get access to it. I want it right here where I can control it. For backup, I use two separate and portable external hard drives.There's also no way, as far as I've been able to find, to create \"rescue discs\", again because there's NO OPTICAL DRIVE. Computer crash? You're screwed, plain and simple.Now, I'm sure an external optical drive can be connected via USB... but then you've turned your \"portable\" laptop into a desktop. Kinda negates the whole idea of the thing, right?Next problem:  the touch screen. This is my first computer with that feature, something more commonly associated with cell phones and tablets. IMO, they're appropriate on those things, but relatively useless on a laptop. It seems to be a bit laggy, and certainly not as precise as using the unit's touchpad-operated cursor. Plus I'm already seeing finger smears on my screen. How attractive, I'm sure...Dell claims in the promo blurb that this unit is good for gaming. Well, I think that depends on what you consider \"gaming\". It will certainly play some games, but I'm highly doubtful if that would include immersive and complex RPGs (for example).You can buy and install (online only as there's NO OPTICAL DRIVE) a bunch of games that look to me to be the kind of games that you'd run on Xbox or something like it. But the big games like Skyrim or Dragon Age require some tech specs that I'm not really seeing here. The hard drive runs at 5400 RPM, and I think anything less than 7200 is going to be problematic for the more immersive games.Also, it's got an \"intergrated\" video card - whatever that means - and I haven't been able to find any actual performance specs on it. So I'd take the \"gaming\" claim with a lot of salt.The other major problem here is the OS. It's Windows 8.1. Now, I can't ding Dell on this one. That's the latest OS Microsoft's got out there, and manufacturers like Dell have to go with what's available.But, boy oh boy, everything sucky I've heard about this OS is true. It's one of the main reasons I've put off considering getting a new computer to this point. I currently depend on my Dell XPS 8000 running Windows 7 (a truly fabulous desktop), and if I had to depend on something using Windows 8.1, I'd probably end up going back to an abacus. It's laggy, and I completely HATE the default \"desktop\". You can switch to a more \"traditional\" desktop appearance, but it doesn't stay there - or at least I can't find a way to make it do so permanently - and every time I inadvertently touch the wrong spot on the screen I end up with those cell-phone-like tiles all over my screen. Why do the drones at Microsoft think we want our computers to be nothing more than big iPads?Anyway, there you have it; 3  stars rounded up.","rating":4},{"comment":"It's tough writing about a computer these days without spending the bulk of your time rambling on about its operating system.  So, in that spirit I will say:As much as I dislike Windows 8, the Dell Inspiron with its touchscreen seems to be exactly what Microsoft was hoping someone would build.  The two really work well together.  So before you dismiss this laptop for having Win 8, or run out and get some other operating system, give it a try.Now, the machine itself.The Dell Inspiron i5547-7500 comes loaded with great hardware.

I found the lack of an optical drive a real drawback, too.Spend a few dollars more and get a Mac&#8230;","rating":2},{"comment":"The Dell Inspiron i5547-7500sLV 15.6-Inch Touchscreen Laptop is a great everyday laptop.  Featuring an i7-4510U processor, a respectable 8GB of RAM and a large 1TB hard drive, and integrated camera, it has all you need for life on the go, keeping up with social media and email or travel demands.The laptop arrived in the manufacturer&#8217;s box and given the size of the box and the small amount of packing material I was surprised it arrived without damage.  Setup was quite simple.  Within minutes I had it up and running.I am used to Windows 7, so the jump to Windows 8.1 was a bit traumatic for me, but I got used to it fairly quickly.  You pretty much just get an OS with this laptop so you&#8217;ll need to reinstall everything you normally use.  Case in point, I reached for my Office 2010 install DVD and was surprised this laptop does not include an optical drive.  I don&#8217;t think a DVD drive would really add any weight or depth to the laptop.Performance-wise, the laptop seems responsive.  The hard drive is not an SSD so it does take some time to load windows.  It is also 5400 rpm, so it is on the slower side.I transferred about 15,000 pictures from my desktop to this laptop in around 30 minutes using a USB 2.0 thumb drive.  This laptop does have USB 3 ports as well as a SD reader.  I copied a few large files from a USB 3 device and the speed was dramatically faster than the USB 2.0 device as expected.  Inserting a SD card took some time for the OS to recognize, but the SD card ended up as a drive letter when it was recognized.The touchpad seems a little awkward to me &#8211; it does not have the sensitivity of some devices I&#8217;ve tried.  I had so much trouble using it I finally ended up resorting to an external mouse.  The buttons on the touchpad are also a bit frustrating &#8211; perhaps I just need more time to get used to them.  As for the touch screen control &#8211; this seems smooth and responsive. The keyboard seems a bit compressed but I like how the keys respond and I really love the backlighting.Battery life is good on this laptop.  I ran for several hours straight on battery, copying files, installing applications and running office productivity programs and didn&#8217;t drain the battery past half.  The built-in network adapter is quite good at picking up signals &#8211; I maintained a good signal strength despite moving around the house in areas that typically produced weakened signals with my old laptop.In all, this is a great every day laptop for general usage.  I have done some software development on it too, but I think this laptop is aimed more that the typical Windows 8.1 user market \/ demographic.  I don&#8217;t find the laptop too heavy &#8211; the ruggedized brushed aluminum design looks impressive and the laptop is very thin.  I do lament about the lack of optical drive and I do not have an external optical drive laying about.  However, I think this laptop packs the technology to remain useable for years to come.","rating":5},{"comment":"This Dell Inspiron has given me my first experience with laptop computing and I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  It has more than fulfilled my average, ordinary expectations, and has provided me with a welcome alternative to our Dell desktop unit, which is almost always being used by one of my other family members.  With its light weight and sleek appearance, it has been deemed to be too cool for mom.  Too bad though, because mom is keeping this one.This Dell product comes with the new Windows 8.1 OS.  It was a big shock at first, but with a bit of practice, I now feel pretty confident in finding my way around.  I've been using this computer for almost a week and have found its speed to be above average, screen quality to be much better than my desktop, and the sound quality to be adequate for most tasks.  Looking at the screen from an angle can cause problems, but straight on views are excellent.  This computer handled video streaming without any problems, and performed basic internet functions without a hitch.  It also performed well as an e-reader.  Love that big screen!Set up was accomplished quickly and without any problems.  I registered the computer with Dell right away and discovered that a 30 day free trial of McAfee security was included.  I was surprised to find that this computer does not include an external drive, so no watching DVD's for me!  I used this discovery as an excuse to explore the free streaming services offered by our local public library, so I didn't feel that this was much of an issue for me.  I estimate the battery life to be around five hours.The touch screen is an excellent feature for this unit, and is very responsive.  I am surprised by how often I find myself using it, essentially turning this laptop into a combination of a tablet and desktop unit.  The best of both worlds!  In summary, I feel that this Dell Inspiron unit is a perfect computer for my use. While I am easily dazzled by the screen resolution, the backlit keyboard, the touchscreen, and the fancy operating system, I can see that it won't be perfect for everyone.  The lack of an external disc drive and the totally average sound quality will be deal breakers for some people.  For me, an average, ordinary computer user who streams video, reads books, does a little writing, and surfs the web, this laptop is just about perfect.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Dell Inspiron i5547-7500sLV 15.6-Inch Touchscreen Laptop is something of a curiosity. Like the new class of &#8220;Ultrabook&#8221; portable computers, it is very thin and sleek looking, with no optical drive to add weight or girth. However, at 6 pounds it is twice the weight of your average ultrabook. So what do you get for the extra weight? In my opinion you get about twice the functionality and that&#8217;s a good thing.I own an ultrabook (HP ENVY 13-2150nr Spectre XT 13.3&#34;) and I like it for a number of specific tasks. I especially like its portability (3 pounds with a small footprint) and the speed of its solid state drive. It slips neatly in the smallest briefcase or even a small tote. It&#8217;s great for streaming media on the go, doing simple correspondence or messing around on social media. It is NOT, in any practical way, a substitute for a full function laptop or desktop computer. Depending on your needs the Dell Inspiron i5547-7500sLV may well be.With my ultrabook (and the others I&#8217;ve looked at) what you give up for the wonderful lightness and sleek profile are screen size (between 10&#8221;and 14&#8221; generally) and storage capacity (a couple of hundred gigabytes or less). I have also found that my ultrabook has less battery life than your typical notebook computer. I chalk this up to the smaller profile battery. I work in freelance media and teach college. The audio and video editing I do on my computers takes up a considerable amount of hard drive space and the detail work is hard to do on any screen smaller than 15-inches. For me the The Dell Inspiron i5547-7500sLV is nearly the perfect compromise between small and light and big and beefy, nearly perfect.When it comes to looks you have to give it to the Inspiron. It definitely has the sleek look of an ultrabook. The combination of brushed aluminum with black trim, keys and bezel make for a very classy, &#8220;corporate&#8221; presence. The fit and finish are first rate. This machine has a very solid feel. There is no torque in the hinges, the unit closes securely and sits flat without a tendency to flop over when open. The keyboard backlighting is very nicely done and the keys themselves (including a number pad) are full sized and well placed for comfortable typing. The touchpad works fine as well.While the Inspiron&#8217;s display is technically HD (similar to 720p resolution on a TV) it is not full HD (like 1080p). I would think that in this day and age and at this price point, full HD (or better) would be pretty standard. The Inspiron&#8217;s picture is surprisingly good considering its specs. With both image movement for navigation and video playback the image motion is steady, artifact free and has good color characteristics. The 10-finger capacitive touchscreen sensitivity is good. It is similar to the high end tablets I own or have used.Sound is another matter. The sound sucks. I have owned 10 notebook and laptop computers over the past two decades and this Inspiron has the worst sound of any before it. It is weak, tinny and what low end it has is muddy and indistinct. While we&#8217;ve all come to expect pretty lousy sound from notebooks, this is subpar even considering those low standards. I did the usual fiddling with the setup and software controls, but there is no internal solution to this problem. The good news is that it is strictly a speaker fail. I hooked the machine up to a brand new JBL Voyager Portable Bluetooth Speaker and the improvement was staggering. If I were Dell I would add another ounce or two and put some reasonable speakers in these things from now on. It&#8217;s a media driven world and this simply won&#8217;t do. I know it&#8217;s possible. I own a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9&#8221; tablet and it has amazing sound for its size.The Inspiron comes with a 2 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 8 GB of ram (upgradeable to 16GB). While not blazing fast or top loaded with a ton or memory, both should be more than plenty for just about any day-to-day application. Having a 1TB hard drive in a computer this size is huge. It allows you to do a whole host of work that the tiny solid state hard drives in ultrabooks prevent. Why Dell would use a drive that spins at only 5400 RPM is another matter. I haven&#8217;t installed any high end video editing software on the machine yet so I can&#8217;t say exactly how it will perform, but I have had some trouble in the past with doing video editing work on slow hard drives. For everyday use like video playback, streaming, etc. It will (and does) work just fine.As far as connecting to the outside world the Inspiron comes with all the standard I\/Os along with an HDMI jack that actually works correctly (not all computers can say this). The Centrino wireless and the Bluetooth 4.0 connected first time with no hassle and so-far have not dropped the signal once. The Inspiron also has a media card reader built in and 2 USB 3.0 ports which will come in handy on a machine with no optical drive. Another thing this machine has that some ultrabooks don&#8217;t is a standard Ethernet wired jack. The machine also comes with a built-in web cam which is also pretty standard these days.I charged the battery to 100% before booting up the machine for the first time. Since I left it alone for a couple of hours, I can&#8217;t say how much charge it came with. I turned on the Inspiron and spent about 45 minutes going through the registration, firmware updates and setup routines. After that I played around with the unit for two hours or so of streaming video, listening to music, playing with settings, etc. I was down to about 60% charge remaining. Battery life is about 20% less than Dell&#8217;s claim (for my style of use), which is pretty standard among notebook computer manufacturers in my experience. Obviously, your battery drain will depend greatly on the operations you&#8217;re performing.The Inspiron comes with Windows 8.1 (64 bit) installed. I am currently using four computers at home. One has Vista, one has Windows 7 and two have Windows 8. As far as I&#8217;m concerned all of the operating systems have their pluses and minuses. Windows eight&#8217;s biggest problem is that it&#8217;s very different than the MS interfaces that came before it. After you invest a little time in the learning curve, it&#8217;s just fine. There is some of Dell&#8217;s usual bloatware installed, but not a lot. Most of the hard drive is open for you to fill as you see fit.To sum up, the The Dell Inspiron i5547-7500sLV 15.6-Inch Touchscreen Laptop has a lot going for it. It is sleek, well built, and has considerable computing power and versatility for its size. The nasty audio, slow hard drive and slightly disappointing battery life leave it one star short of excellent.","rating":4},{"comment":"This Dell laptop itself is pretty sweet. You get a nice big 15.6\" screen (which is also a pretty responsive touchscreen), 8GBs of memory and a 1TB internal hard drive (would've been nice to get that as a solid state drive but what's here does just fine). The keyboard is a nice LED backlit addition with sturdy buttons that register every entry. The speakers are of above average quality and the laptop itself does not overheat, which I noticed initially. It manages to keep pretty cool even after hours of use, which I found pretty impressive. You get about 6+ hours of battery life on a full charge which is dependent on your settings. I counted three USB ports and a media card reader divided on both sides, and also a headphone port and HDMI port. The cover is a nice aluminum finish and generally speaking, it's not overly heavy. Speaking of the aforementioned touchscreen, the thing is a magnet for small children. All it takes is one quick touch from their little fingers to close a window or mess up whatever it is that you're working on or looking at. There's also Bluetooth functionality included.Now, the one thing I have an issue with isn't a flaw against the laptop itself but the Windows 8.1 OS that comes installed on it. This is my first time using this OS (it's actually VERY similar to the Xbox One dashboard in looks and functionality) and I have to say, I'm not particularly crazy about it. It seems unfair to knock it with only a couple of days using it but it's not a particularly intuitive OS. Out of the box, I was able to figure some things out but more often than not, I'd find that the OS would inexplicably do things while I was using the track pad and I could never figure out what I did to get these things to happen. For example, I'd be looking at something on the web browser and all of a sudden, it would literally leave the browser and open up an app. One time was fine but then it happened again and again, maybe about ten times in total. I'm pretty sure that I'll have to adjust the track pad settings to limit this occurrence but it was a major annoyance as it happened repeatedly. I'm not really sure whether or not this is due to the OS or maybe the track pad is just overly sensitive. It's not a complete wash however because when it works, it works really well. Downloading apps was a cinch from the MS Store and I appreciate how having a MS account is a great way to unify all the MS products I use, especially the Xbox One. Either way, this Windows 8.1 OS leaves a little something to be desired.At the end of the day, I find the laptop to work exceptionally well. Internet connectivity is super fast and opening and closing apps is quick as well. I'd recommend it but you may have to fiddle around with the settings for the OS to work as intended for you, unless you're already pretty familiar with it.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a very nice laptop computer featuring an Intel 4th Generation i7 CPU. I used to have a Dell Latitude and this Inspiron has a trendier and classier design than the Latitude (minus the docking connector as a business laptop).  So far I have no problems in the few weeks that I have had it.First off, I am not reviewing the Win 8.1 OS that comes bundled with the laptop. A touchscreen enabled laptop (which this laptop is not) would have been a better fit for Win 8.1.Packaging is minimal but environmentally friendly. The laptop is wrapped in a soft pouch cushioned by 2 carton moulds. Included are a power cord, AC adapter and a quick guide. Installation is easy and took me about 10 minutes to complete. There were some potentially unwanted programs pre-installed with the Dell's Win 8.1 OS - Pocket Cloud, Amazon 1Button app, eBay and trial ware such as McAfee LiveSafe and Microsoft Office. You can just uninstall them if you have no use for them.This laptop features a powerful Intel Core i7 4th gen CPU at 2 GHz with turbo boost to 3.1 GHz - 2 cores and 4 threads - with extended battery life technology. The OS indicates a battery life of over 6 hours after a full charge. The 1 GB, 5400 RPM hard drive is plentiful for most users (Seagate ST1000LM024 in my laptop). This laptop has enough horse power and storage to do most demanding tasks including HD video editing. However, it may not be adequate for latest gaming due to the value oriented Intel HD4400 graphics chipset.The 11366x768 15.6\" LCD screen is bright and vivid. However, there seems to be a sweet spot vertically (when looking slightly up at an angle), otherwise color would be washed out. There is no sweet spot when viewing horizontally. An external monitor can be hooked up via the HDMI port on the right side of the laptop. On the sides are also 1 USB 2.0, 2 USB 3.0 ports, a SD\/MS card reader, a 10\/100 Ethernet port. Note that there is no Gigabit LAN connection in this laptop.The keyboard is back-lit which is useful when working in a dimly lit environment. The keyboard flexes slightly in the middle when typed upon but it doesn't distract or affect the experience at all. The Dell tracking pad is easy to use and supports multi-gesture (software configurable). Clicking can be achieved by tapping on the pad (software defeatable) or using the traditional, tactile buttons embedded at the bottom of the pad. The OEM for the Dell pad in my laptop is Synaptics, and for the sound, Ethernet and card reader is Realtek. The wireless module is an Intel Dual Band Wireless AC3160. Connection is solid without any drops and range is very good (connected to my dual-band wireless-N network).One thing to point out is that this laptop does not have a CD\/DVD drive. This is mostly not a problem nowadays since you can make an image copy of most CD\/DVD and transfer it to the laptop using a USB thumb or hard drive. A lot of commercial software goes for electronic distribution as well. The lack of an optical drive in a laptop becomes less and less of an issue now. If you must have a CD\/DVD drive, you can get an USB external optical drive from Dell or an other manufacturer.As with most computer manufacturers, I recommend owners to visit the support website of their computer manufacturer for the latest software and drivers. Also available there are the owners manual and other documentation not physically included with the laptop.Pros:&#9658; powerful Intel Core 4th gen i7 CPU&#9658; 8 GB RAM upgradable to 16 GB&#9658; wireless 802.11 a\/b\/g\/n\/ac (ac being the latest spec) and Bluetooth 4.0&#9658; backlit keyboard&#9658; SD\/MS card reader&#9658; trendy brushed aluminum top with black bodyCons:&#9658; trialware bundled (Pocket Cloud, McAfee, DropBox, Amazon 1Button app, eBay, Microsoft Office trial)&#9658; no optical drive (not a big deal nowadays)&#9658; vertical sweet spot exists in LCD&#9658; webcam image quality could have been better&#9658; mediocre speakers (sound hallow)&#9658; 1 of the USB ports is 2.0 instead of making all USB 3.0To sum up, this Dell Inspiron i5547-5780SLV is a very nice non-touchscreen laptop. It has the horse power for demanding tasks and a trendy look with its brushed aluminum top. This is a great laptop to have. However, you may also want to consider the slightly more expensive models with a touchscreen in order to take full advantage of Win 8.1's Metro interface.","rating":4},{"comment":"I hovered between a three and four star on this one, but ultimately because of what are for me key issues I'm going lower.  Think it is worth taking a serious look at comparably priced laptops - even other Dell Inspiron ones - to get the computer that hosts the features you'll most require.Here's what I like:I like Dell Inspiron's - I've had two before  of varying sizes.  They've proven their value to me over time. This one isn't an exception:- From a look, feel, quality of materials and resolution, plus long lasting battery life this one has it all - right down to the backlit\/spill resistant keypad.- Add on lots of speed and lots of storage - and ultimately the computer itself is a winner.Here's what I don't like:This one is just not that user friendly:- Windows 8 isn't a favorite of mine ever - but is completely insufferable when put on a machine that doesn't have a touch screen. Note to Dell: Windows 8 is designed for touch.  Please stop torturing people by putting it on machines it is clearly not intended for. Note to potential buyer: Make sure you check out the touchpad version of this computer - costs sometimes are roughly the same.- The lack of a DVD drive is a definite issue.  One day it will probably very well be true that this won't be needed.  But, there are still many of us at all ages that still at least occassionally need it - to load software, to upload music, or in my case - to play my favorite, un-uploadable foreign language learning programme.Bottom Line: A good computer with a couple of features issues. Would definitely compare with ones that have touch screen and disc drives.","rating":3},{"comment":"This laptop comes preload with Windows 8.1. Like many people, I have some criticism about Windows 8. I am limiting my review to the laptop, not Windows.Unpacking and set up was easy. The packaging was barebones. The laptop was suspended by cardboard edge protectors inside of a cardboard box. Included was the power brick and cord. There is minimal printed documentation. None is needed.Upon power up, the operating system walked me through the setup and registration process. Once finished, I was good to go. Setup took approximately 10 minutes.ProsThe brushed metal exterior top looks good and resists fingerprints.It runs quiet and cool.The numeric keypad is very useful.The trackpad is large and responsive. Multi-touch gestures work well. The button clicks have slight tactile and auditory feedback, which is good. Tap to click works well also.It is relatively lightThe 15 inch widescreen display is a nice size. The proportions are very good for watching movies.The backlighting on the keyboard is good.ConsThe viewing angles for the screen could be more generous, especially vertically. The colors and contrast are actually best when viewed looking slightly up at the screen, not head on.The screen is glossy. This is a con for me, but might be a pro for others.The keyboard flexes when you type and feels cheap. There is mediocre tactile feedback.The quality of the audio is mediocre. The sound is hollow.It has a difficult time maintaining a WiFi connection to my home network (compared to my PowerBook, iPhone, and iPad which are all in the same room).NeutralThere is no built in DVD drive. This obviously saves on cost and weight and is becoming less important.The quality of the webcam camera is adequate, but not great.The laptop I received was not the touchscreen version. I recommend getting the touchscreen, especially with Windows 8. I was able to reach someone from Dell technical support (but not order support) on a Sunday to verify the laptop is in fact the non-touchscreen version. They were very helpful.","rating":4},{"comment":"I was going to rate this 4 stars, but there are certain things about it that made me bring my rating down to 3 stars.First the good and the average:1. Very lightweight so easy to carry around, and some nice new features2. However needs getting used to, because the address bar is on the bottom, plus I had to play around with it to get used to certain maneuvers for when one window opens on half the screen, and another window opens in the other half of the screen.3. I thought it was neat that two windows could be opened side by side, each taking only half the space of the screen.4. Voice quality good but not great, basically it's average. So I recommend using an earphone or a speaker, for great sound quality.5. Setup is easyThe not so good:1. This does not have microsoft office installed on it, which is fine. However because it doesn't have a cd\/dvd opening, then I can't insert the cd of the mircosoft office 2010 that I had bought a while back, and that allows me to install microsoft 2010 on up to 3 pcs. I won't buy a new microsoft 2013 product, when I should be able to just use my activation key and get microsoft on this laptop. When I clicked on the microsoft office tab, a small box opened, and it gives options like \"buy\" or \"already bought\" or \"free trail\". However this will only allow you to insert a product key for miscrosoft 2013 product, and doesn't give options for other versions of the product.2. This brings me to my next point, this doesn't have a cd\/dvd opening. This isn't so important these days with streaming services and mp3 downloads. But again, for installation of products as mentioned above, this is important, so it should've been present.3. This is not the touch screen laptop. This wouldn't have been a negative if this laptop hadn't been described as touchscreen, because it's not.Overall this is a fairly good laptop, but it won't be the one I use mainly. I find my other pc better, and it will stay the one I use mainly.","rating":3},{"comment":"This review is for the Dell Inspiron 15 5547 without a touchscreen.  I am not a computer expert, but a knowledgeable user having used laptops, tablets, and desktops. I have always used Windows software with the recent exception of Android tablets.  This is my second experience with Windows 8 and I realize there is a lot of controversy over this relatively new operating system.The specifications for this laptop are a 15.6\" non-touch HD screen, a 4th generation i7-4510u Intel processor with 8gb ram expandable to 16gb ram, and an integrated Intel HD 4400 graphics processor.  There is no DVD drive with this model. There are 2 USB 3.0 ports and one USB 2.0 port as well as a full size HDMI port. It has an ethernet port, headphone jack, and a SD card reader. This model has a backlit keyboard, full integrated numeric keypad, webcam, Wifi and Bluetooth.The fit and finish of this Dell laptop are top quality plastics and aluminum yielding a weight of about 6 lbs. and an inch thick at the hinge. Not the lightest nor the thinnest laptop available, but certainly for the price, it is competitive.Last night I watched a show on HBOGo streaming video and there was no lag or buffering at all and the HD screen was clear, bright with excellent contrast.I do believe that if you are going to benefit from Windows 8, you need a touch screen, or use the Classic windows theme and desktop.  Like buying a car, you first determine how much you want to spend, then look for a model you like that you can afford.  Same with laptops.  Do you need a disc drive? Touchscreen? Will you do gaming? Work or home use? There are many variables.  Personally, I prefer a desktop, but the portability of a laptop is certainly undeniable.  Tablets and smartphones are ultra-portable.  Depends how you want to compute and connect.  I find value in all the venues.  I have bought 3 Dell desktops in the past, and they have all served me well, in fact, I am typing this review on a 6 year old Dell desktop.This Dell laptop has competition from HP, Sony, Acer, Toshiba and others with similar specs.  Personally, I trust Dell, look for good deals on them and have always gotten my money's worth.  I must say doing research on this particular model was not easily forthcoming as Dell has so very many configurations. I did find it strange that Dell used this very new processor with only dual cores instead of the newer standard four core processors.If you're looking for a middle market priced laptop with a newer processor, this Dell should give you years of use, and should be able to process most anything you can throw at it, with the limitation of some graphic intensive games.  Buying a new laptop is very similar to buying a new car - if you don't know what you're doing, ask someone who does.  Recommended.UPDATE: After using this laptop for a few weeks, I really like it.  I have connected it to my TV via HDMI cable and watched some movies and TV shows. Worked great.  I like the backlit keyboard very much as it really helps in my dimly lit den.  One thing about the screen. You have to adjust the viewing angle to get the picture perfect because when not correct the screen can be difficult to see and loses it nearly perfect clarity and sharpness.  It's not a big deal, but worth noting. Side to side viewing angles are acceptable.  This is very well made, feels substanial and the case doesn't show fingerprints. Love it!","rating":4},{"comment":"My first laptop was a Dell, and it never worked. So it's been over a decade since I used a Dell laptop. This one is far, far better than the first one, I'm happy to report. I won't go over the specs since I think that intelligent computer buyers check them out first thing. So the one-terabyte hard drive, for example, won't factor into my review (though I do like that size).Here's what I did like:1) The back-lit keyboard looks pretty snazzy. I can't say that I'm likely to use the computer too often in the dark, but the keyboard does look nice. It also feels sturdy enough to work. (In fact, before I'd even turned the computer on, a cat walked onto the keyboard and lay down. I didn't notice any problems as a result.)2) The tracking pad works well. I've always eschewed laptops in part because of the tracking pads. I just seem not to get along with them, sometimes because I can't quite manage the right touch to get them to do what I want to do and sometimes because when I'm typing, a stray thumb movement can cause the cursor to jump in a document. So far, I haven't had any problems with this pad.3) The speed seems quite good. I have used the computer for writing documents, playing music, and watching videos (including full-length movies), and I haven't noticed any lagging, even when I have more than one program running. That said, I don't have any high-end games to try and don't intend to.4) Set-up was easy and fairly fast. I didn't time it, but I think it took between five and ten minutes between when I powered the computer on and when it was ready to work.5) The computer is fairly light and looks nice closed.Here's what I'm not keen about.1) There is no CD\/DVD drive. I know that this point is in the specs, but I think it's worth mentioning. Like another reviewer, I have a Microsoft Office disc that I bought, but I can't use it directly on this computer to install the programs. Obviously, playing a CD or DVD directly is out of the question. (Of course, there are solutions to this problem. For under $50, one can buy an external CD\/DVD drive and writer, just as one can buy a cheap mouse to use instead of the tracking pad.)That's it, really. The computer has worked, worked well, and caused no problems. I should admit, though, that I haven't tested the battery life since I've always had the computer plugged in when I've used it.","rating":4},{"comment":"I was really optimistic that I would have a more positive review of this product since I was hoping to replace my 7 year old Macbook (not Pro). I have had a previous model of the Dell Inspiron issued to me by my employer about 4 years ago, so I have previous experience with Dell, mostly positive. I feel a slight responsibility to admit that I prefer Macs, but my preferences will not bias my review of the performance of this machine. There may be some comparisons, but only as it affects my assessment of performance of this laptop. Having no other PC's in the house, this is the best I can do.As stated above, I wanted a new laptop to replace my aging one, although I thought the price of this one a bit high in the PC market. However, it is much cheaper than a new MacBook Pro. (And certainly, through the vine program, absolutely cost-free!).The 1.7 GHz Intel Core i5 processor (with turbo boost) should have been plenty of power to meet my needs. Sadly, my 2.0GHz speed on my old MacBook loads pages faster. The WIFI connection is really poor on this computer and constantly drops connections and won't load pages even when the indicator shows four or a full load of bars. Social media sites time out, and YouTube is a buffering nightmare. The placement in my living room is exactly the same as my 7 year old laptop and all my mobile devices. My iPhone, iPod, my spouse's MacBook Pro, and two iPads load fine there, and swiftly. The Dell loads much faster when I am in the office where the router is located, but the purpose of having a laptop is defeated if I am only 10 feet away from my desktop. You Tube still does not load well, even there.What's up with this price, on a laptop that is weak and unimpressive? Granted, it does boast of a touch screen, but really, how practical is it on a laptop? You are not going to word process on this touchscreen. Although useful for accessing links immediately,  this laptop touchscreen will not compete with a tablet.The battery drains quickly. It boasts of a six and a half hour battery life, but I would be surprised if you get three and a half to four hours.  The laptop comes with a trial of MS word. (My product key will not of course work, since mine is for Mac).So far, the focus has been on the negative. There are positives as well. This laptop is very attractive. The brushed metal top looks very nice and fingerprints do not show. The lack of an optical drive makes it light, and adding an external is really not a problem. I'm still learning the multi-function touch pad, but once I figure it out, I should get better control over what I actually want as opposed to what I am getting. There is no operating manual, only a quick start guide that basically says, \"Plug it in and turn it on\". The screen is also a positive feature. It appears bigger than it actually is, and the resolution is very clear.The remainder of my gripes are related to Windows 8, so I won't go there. I knew XP pretty well, and Windows 8 seems buggy and more complicated than necessary, and even counter-intuitive at times. That, of course, has nothing to do with the laptop's performance, and will not count against it in my overall appraisal.In summary, I'm not terribly impressed with this laptop. I could give it higher marks if the WIFI was not so inconsistent and weightier websites would load faster, or even load at all. Streaming video is also a significant problem that does not exist in my other devices and laptops. If these are concerns you may have, I would keep looking.","rating":3},{"comment":"We've been enjoying this new Dell laptop. My only problem at first was having to upgrade my internet because I could not get internet access on here at first. But once we got that taken care of, it's been going great. I am not very computer literate. In fact, I am pretty bad in all computer and electronic know-how. But this was easy to set up and start using. I love how the keyboard lights up. Having a touch screen doesn't really do much for me, but my daughter has really been liking that. I am not sure if the battery lasts as long as it states it should. I hope I didn't mess up how I was suppose to charge it in order to get the maximum charge. But it does last a few hours. Considering my last laptop stopped charging several months after buying, I am happy with even just an hour or two. Nothing I have ever seems to stay charged as long as they say they are suppose to anyway.So far I am really enjoying this and I'm happy it was so easy. It's very thin, although not any lighter than any other laptops I've held before. It has a nice, sleek look. And I've had no complaints. I tend to use my laptop mostly at night and love how they finally came out with a back-light under the keyboard. What a great idea.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have received today this new laptop from Amazon\/Dell and I am very pleased at first trial.  It is extremely attractive and has many of the style and feature capabilities of a Mac Pro laptop costing about twice as much. I was concerned about the 14\" screen and lack of a DVD burner; but the screen is attractive easy to use with touch features and adequate in all respects. The lack of a DVD reader is for the benefit of weight and I have ordered a $30.00 Amazon Basics USB for loading legacy software and backups.  The keyboard is backlit (just like a MacBook). And I am pleased as punch with this new laptop.","rating":5},{"comment":"Not a computer tekkie here, but a person who uses... for research, communication, recreation.This laptop has so many outstanding features and is exactly what I needed to replace my old second-hand Dell desktop running XP, which by the way, I loved. The state of the art touchscreen on this new Inspiron is fabulous, the speed is impressive, I love the back-lit keyboard which has really good spacing between keys for anyone who has big hammy fingers, or simply for those of us who are touch typists and find it easier to not have to relearn spacing every time we shift keyboards. Yes, actually fullsize. I measured. And did I say BACK-LIT - yea!I needed a lighter weight (this is 5 pounds) laptop to suspend (I will be repurposing a Bracketron vehicle mount) because I can no longer sit or stand in front of a computer for hours as I suffer from swelling in the legs. I must now spend at least part of the time prone with legs higher than heart. And that, I can assure you, is hard to arrange while getting anything at all done. Turns out the adaptation of devices for those with physical problems - and there are quite a number of such people - is called \"assistive technology\". This machine, because of its light weight, is perfect.One of the ways light weight is achieved is by the omission of an optical drive. People in the forefront of computer technology tell us that these drives will be disappearing as music, flicks and software are increasingly cyber-delivered and cyber-stored. But no, you say! I agree. I have many CDs and DVDs as well as software on disc. So I simply ordered a top-rated Samsung optical drive for the times I will need it. They've come 'way down in price. Small problem.I had a fear of Windows 8 because I'd read complaints, especially when the news of the withdrawal of support for the much-loved XP operating system hit. This runs 8.1, of course, which does have some fixes over 8. So far I am not finding the switch overly frustrating, just a normal learning curve.That brings me to what may be the best news: Dell gives outstanding customer support. I've been on the phone with two different Dell techs so far, and have been given courteous and professional assistance with issues that a more computer-savvy person would have been able to solve without that help. This makes so much difference when you're choosing which brand of computer to buy. I am delighted.Did I mention that this little number is thin, fast, smooth and slick?","rating":5},{"comment":"As a warning, I either write short reviews or really long ones. This is one of the latter. I will add to it as more things come up that I notice or think of. If you don't want to read all of it, the bottom line is that I feel there are way too many issues for the price. Some of the pros include the screen quality, the dual tablet\/laptop feel, and the sweet backlit keyboard. However, the physical keyboard can get in the way after a while when solely using the touchscreen, the touchpad often just doesn't work, and my battery life is horrible. Many more details in the review below.-----------------------------------The pros:Screen quality. The screen feels surprisingly big to me, even though it's replacing a recently-dead 17\" laptop. I don't feel that the 14\" size is a compromise at all, and the projection quality is really nice. Colors look beautiful on it, and frankly it's just a beautiful screen. It is a glossy screen, so be prepared to have some reflections and to get fingerprints on it. It's a bit more pixelated than I'd like (particularly when using the Microsoft apps as opposed to the regular desktop) but I can deal with that, it's just so nice to look at otherwise.Convenience of a tablet with the utility of a laptop. I love the fact that this is a touchscreen computer, as that is kind of the way things are moving anyway with the increasing prevalence of smartphones and tablets compared to conventional computers. To put it in a nutshell, you've got your traditional Windows computer with the desktop. It's what you've known forever and expect from Windows. But the Start Menu has been revamped to turn into a Metro tile-based interface that begs to be used as a touchscreen. And it works really well. I've already kind of forgotten the whole alt-tab to switch between running applications and just use the tablet-style method that Microsoft has built in, in which you swipe from the left to bring up a list of your recent apps. There are some weird things, like the fact that there's an Amazon app in the Start Menu already but I can just go to the website if I go to the desktop (which is faster because the app takes a while to start up!). But I really like being able to switch back and forth between the two modes.Keyboard. The keyboard is not only quiet to type on, but it lights up when you type on it, which is great if you're in a dim area. It is also comfortable and easy to type on even with big hands, which I have.Storage. The hard drive is one terrabyte (1000 gigabytes). That will probably last most people a long time.-----------------------------------The okay:Touchscreen and touchpad operation. The touchscreen generally works fine but I do find it to be a bit wonky sometimes. This is probably application-specific, I would guess. Just stuff not responding sometimes and things like that. The touchpad, on the other hand, is a different story. There have been many times since I got this laptop a few days ago that the touchpad just doesn't work. I can move the mouse around with it but trying to click on the screen with it produces no result, even when I am sure I'm pressing the \"left mouse\" button. I end up having to switch to the touchscreen to do what I want to do.Premium price. Why does this cost so much? Because it's a touchscreen? Most laptops these days average at least a couple hundred cheaper than this, so I guess that's the reason, but still, given how many nitpicks I've found with it in only the last two days, $750 is a lot to ask and frankly consumers should expect more for their money.Performance. Performance is generally good. The computer is snappy and it handles multiple applications well. I am not a huge gamer anymore but I tested some games out to see how they did. For the most part I was able to run relatively new games (from within the last 2-3 years) at full settings with no issues. One surprising experience was trying to play Left 4 Dead 2 at full settings since it can get hectic at times with everything onscreen; the computer couldn't handle it very well. It was choppy, and this was single player, so I know it wasn't internet-dependent. Dropping to the recommended video settings made it smooth as silk again. For some reason Civilization V, while run at full settings and running great, triggers a \"low memory\" warning from Windows. This has happened multiple times, only with this game. But in general the performance is good, especially for a pre-packaged laptop.Lack of an optical drive. I didn't realize this wouldn't have an optical drive in it when I ordered it. And while that's an inconvenience, it's still okay. The world is moving toward streaming. Even as service providers move more and more toward data caps (even for home internet now!), the world continues to move more and more toward streaming. You can watch TV, watch movies, play music, and play games all without any physical device except your laptop (or smartphone, or tablet). So it's not earth-shattering that this laptop doesn't have an optical drive, but for those of us who do have an excessive collection of CDs and DVDs, it's a bit of an annoyance to think about having to get a removable drive.Speakers. I have not found them to be anything special. They're laptop speakers, and they sound like it. They sound nice and everything, there's just no power to them. Remember the iTunes \"Rush\" scene from the movie \"I Love You, Man\"? Expect a little more than that; laptop speakers are laptop speakers.Heat. It heats up pretty quickly. It is not scalding like my last (HP) laptop, in which at times I couldn't even rest my hand on it, it was so hot. But it does get pretty hot on the right side (on top and underneath) if you are sensitive to that.Fingerprint magnet. As expected, the touchscreen is a fingerprint magnet. I don't know how you could really avoid this, though. Dell could have at least provided a microfiber cloth to wipe the screen off with.-----------------------------------The cons:What is it? This is, to be perfectly honest, a laptop that desperately wants to feel like a tablet. But it's not a tablet, and the experience suffers from it. Having used touchscreen smartphones and a tablet for years now, I'm used to just using my hands to manipulate a screen. I like this part of the computer and I definitely just use it as a touchscreen more often than not. But at the same time I feel awkward because I've got this giant bottom half in front of me (the keyboard and touchpad). I would rather have this be a swivel\/convertible computer than to have a touchscreen that doesn't seem aware that I've got a big keyboard in front of me still. Case in point: touch anywhere on the screen in a text box, and a virtual keyboard pops up on the screen. Why would I want to type on a *vertical* angle? Suddenly I'm looking at two keyboards, the one in front of me and the one taking up half the screen; thankfully typing on the normal keyboard makes the virtual one go away. Playing touchscreen games is fun because they're touchscreen, but still I'm having to continually reach way out past the physical keyboard to play them. It's things like that that make me wonder about the real \"point\" of touchscreen computers that aren't tablets.The battery. Yeah, I don't know what Dell is talking about in the product description but the battery in mine is terrible. I've lost 7% in the last 15 minutes and all I've been doing is typing this review and streaming music from the browser. Seven percent in 15 minutes. The battery charges reasonably quickly (a couple hours) but really I'm finding that this lasts only a few hours anyway on a full battery, pretty far from the implication in the product description. It is nothing to brag about. They say in the description that it's \"impressive,\" but if you look at the specs they even list battery life as 6.5 hours. That's not impressive, that's actually pretty bad for a laptop, and much more than I'm getting out of it. I have probably had to recharge this at least five times in the last four days, and most of the time I'm just browsing the internet when it's unplugged.Other annoying things, mainly Windows-related. 1) In the Windows app store, you can't open apps you already have installed. You can only open them from your applications list, or if you make a shortcut somewhere. 2) It is not obvious how to get to your apps to launch them. Here's a hint: go to the Start Menu and swipe up anywhere except the very bottom edge to change panels and go to your apps. 3) The app store was promoting a certain game so I thought I'd download it and check it out. I installed and played it last night and thought it was pretty fun. I tried it again today and it wouldn't work. It told me my computer is not compatible with the game. What? I just played it yesterday. And why in the world would my brand new computer not be compatible with it? It's hardly intensive.Lack of any kind of manual. It comes with a small \"Quick Startup\" booklet that basically just says to plug it in and turn it on. Seriously. But for me, having come from Vista on my personal computer and Windows 7 on my work computer, Windows 8.1 is quite a big jump. I really would have liked more of an instruction manual to show me what's new and what's different and to not have to do things through trial and error or looking on the internet for basic things (like how to find my list of apps, which I had to look on Google for).-----------------------------------Bottom line: it costs too much, in my opinion. Maybe I'm being harsh, but at the same time I rely HEAVILY on Amazon reviews for products I buy and consumer reviews mean everything to me when I'm trying to judge how to spend my money, so I hope that my review helped you. Am I unhappy with it? No, it didn't cost me anything. But I am disappointed and I would expect more from it for the price.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a good PC and a good value. It's not without small problems, but it's well worth the money.First, the construction. This is a solidly made PC with 1 USB-2 and 2 USB-3 ports and a nice backlit keyboard with three settings-off, high and medium. The brushed metal top keeps fingerprints away, unlike like my other Dell with black plastic top. The keyboard has a nice feel to it and the hinges seem solid and should withstand a lot of openings and closings. For its physical overall size, the screen is huge and easily readable.It comes with Windows 8.1 which simply sucks. Why Microsoft chose to completely alter the GUI to make it more difficult to be productive is beyond me.The only backstep they made with 8.1 is to make it easier to boot to the Windows 7 desktop.. Basically you can use it like Windows 7 without the cumbersome and counter-productive Windows 8.1 interface which makes one wonder why they even bothered changing the interface. The remainder of the review was made after all windows, application software, and drivers were updated.Although this PC does not come with another SSD drive for faster booting as other ultrabooks, it restores quick enough from hibernate and very quickly from sleep. Not having an SSD wasn't a deal-killer for me because the frequency of my needing the SSD is low. Operational performance is very good with 8 MB of RAM. Multiple windows are also handled easily. I don't use it for gaming so I can't address its performance in that area, but MSOffice application windows and internet pages are handled quickly.Typical bloatware is included and they were removed almost as soon as I took it out of the box. I guess it's just a normal part of doing business but it's more work to set up the PC.A continuing problem I have been having is that my Bluetooth mouse will hang up regularly and the only way to get it functioning is to uninstall it and reinstall it. Then it will work for an indeterminate time afterwards. Why use the mouse at all with a touch screen? Because it's more accurate and a touch screen does not have the functionality of a multi-button mouse. I agree with an earlier reviewer that said that this is a PC trying to be a tablet. On a tablet, a touch screen is mandatory. On a PC, it's a marginally useful addition. Yes it's nice to point to a part of the screen to activate its function, but the touch screen has no right click, no close window and a variety of other functions that a multi -button mouse provides. I only rarely use the touch screen and then mainly for option selection and scrolling. For me, it's merely a marketing ploy for a PC. The current unreliability of the mouse is therefore particularly troublesome.No CD\/DVD is included with the PC which is no big deal for me. I use them only to load software and make large data backups or burn DVDs so connecting an external CD\/DVD drive occasionally is not a problem. They are now inexpensive enough to have them externally rather than part of the PC. I would suggest using an external hard disk for regular backups.Battery life is on the order of 5-6 hours depending on use. Bright screen settings, backlit keyboard, gaming with high-res video, mega database number-crunching should take its toll on the battery. However with my normal workload of word processing, spreadsheet, internet surfing, and medium database applications keep me at the higher end of that range, at least initially. As with all batteries, they begin to lessen their holding power over time so the battery life should lessen over time. One current problem is that the battery indicator on the taskbar indicates that I have several hundred hours of life left on this charge which is clearly erroneous. Not worth sending it back because the percentage seems to be accurate, but incorrect nevertheless.The trackpad is huge and sometimes activates when I am merely typing and brush over it. I recall that there is a setting to lessen its sensitivity for this but I haven't tested this as yet. Another similar problem is with Windows 8.1 in general. In Microsoft's infinite wisdom, they have provided several touch screen options that purport to make things easier and more accessible. One of these is the sweep from far right to left, which opens a menu giving access to 5 functions. Not bad, unless it gets in the way when you inadvertently move your hand from right to left  which I have frequently done.Lest you think that I am totally against WIn 8.1, they did do some things nicely. I do like the idea that you can easily switch from regular desktop to WIN 8.1 with the Windows keyboard key which has largely been ignored over the years. The introduction of live tiles in the Win 8.1 is a nice touch and informative.Face recognition is a nice security option although if you do not choose a secondary method, like a password, anyone can access your PC as long as they put their face in front of the camera. This is hardly secure. It should have a list of authorized faces and if yours is not one of them, you don't get in. In order to make your PC really secure, you need a password with the voice recognition which gives you exactly the same security as a password alone. To be fair, there are two other secondary security methods that may be used that can make your PC more secure, but the face recognition alone adds little for security.So, overall, this is a good PC with some small problems. Not enough for a 5-star rating but a solid 4-star.Update on Bluetooth mouse problem:After searching the Net, I found the following which corrects my Bluetooth mouse operation:- In the Search Charms, type Device Manager.- Browse Bluetooth.- Right click on the mouse driver shown and click on Properties.- In the power management window, uncheck the option \"Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power\".","rating":4},{"comment":"This laptop is fast, easy to use and actually pretty light for its size!  It boots up fast and switches between programs even faster.  I love the lighted keys, they are subtle but really help out in a low lighted room.  This laptop is about the perfect size for carrying out the house and using on the couch\/bed but also at the desk.  The battery is great, I more often than not leave it unplugged and It lasts for days.  No complaints about this little machine.","rating":5},{"comment":"This laptop is perfect for the on the go person.  I've never had one before this so for me this was a whole new ball game and I must say I'm liking it.  Light enough to take on the road while sturdy enough to not make me cringe like I do with my tablet when I happen to put it down a bit to roughly.The instructions for setup were really easy but I must say I do prefer the mouse to the touch screen of Windows 8.  Most likely it's because I'm not good with change and the older versions have been much more to my liking.I was not happy that there was no disc drive.  You would think for the price that at least you could get that so you can load software.  Sheesh.This unit has basics in the software department so if you are looking for something with a word processer or a spread sheet program you should make sure and get it from a download.The mouse works really well.  Very gentle touching will get you where you want to go.  Screen display is good and the sound system is very good.  Graphic display is nice also.  No problems there and I'm sure you'll be happy with how this machine really is.Before I got this all I could think about was how much I really didn't want Windows 8 due to all the hype about it not being as good.  It's really not that bad but if you're like me and like old school then it will take some getting used to.  It has it's advantages but takes a bit to figure out what is what.  When you turn the laptop on it comes right on.  Now lagging like some of the desktops do.  The virus software that comes with it is not my fav and I doubt I will use it.  So make sure and pay attention to that especially if you will be online or sharing zip drives.The time it took to charge this fully was not that long at all.  I think my tablet takes twice as long so this surprised me.  Useable battery life is about 5 hours which I found to be to my liking very much considering some of the other brands I was looking at.I would recommend this for a student of any age or for someone who would be doing mostly casual stuff.  This is not a gaming system so don't expect all the hoppla that goes with those.","rating":5},{"comment":"Thin and lightweight, this touchscreen (touchpad also included) PC is eminently portable, combining the feel of a laptop and tablet. Boasting a sleek and clean design, including a beautiful HD screen, it is aesthetically pleasing and easy to use. Though it contains drawbacks (see below), I would generally recommend this laptop, especially to people on the go.PROS--As mentioned, the design is sleek and simple. Because of the convenience of the touch screen, there's no need to have--for example--a volume control next to the keyboard. The laptop feels hardy and durable, and the spine seems unlikely to wear out. Both the computer itself and the transformer are very light.--I agree with other reviewers that the 14.0&#34; screen FEELS bigger, perhaps due to its bright, vivid, HD quality. Despite the touch screen, fingerprints aren't visible.--The machine boots up and shuts down in a few seconds.--It has an easy-to-use backlit keyboard, and its keys are widely spaced without taking up too much room. The keyboard is comfortable for people with small or large hands alike.--Battery life is about 7.5 hours. Additionally, the laptop runs quickly and efficiently, handling multiple tabs or tasks well.--With a 1 TB hard drive, there's plenty of storage space.CONS--One reason for the very lightweight feel is the lack of an optical drive, so you can't use this to play CDs or DVS, or to install software. However, it has three USB ports, and you can always purchase an external optical drive if you want one. [Speaking of ports, it also has an HDMI port, so you can connect it to your TV.]--Speaker quality is quite poor, and sounds are tinny and weak. If you care about this at all, you'll want to get a nice set of headphones.--I've found the WiFi patchy. Though my Toshiba laptop and my brother's Samsung tablet get an excellent signal anywhere in the house, this laptop doesn't connect to the WiFi in every room.--Windows 8 is a pain and takes some major getting used to, though you really can't get away from this with any new PC.--When you're using the Internet or the various apps, a sidebar sometimes pops up with features like &#34;search&#34; and &#34;share.&#34; Also, a large display appears on the bottom with the date and time. These displays appear seemingly at random, though I can't for the life of me figure out where to position the cursor to make them appear when I want them to.SO-SO--It's very nice to have the option of using either the touchscreen or the touchpad. While the touchscreen works well, the the touchpad is slightly twonky. Once, it failed to work altogether, but this resolved when I restarted the machine. Other times, I somehow inadvertently make the screen zoom in or out.  For tasks that require dexterity, like navigating Google Maps, the touchpad also isn't great. [As a side note, the touchscreen features an onscreen keyboard, which would give you a serious case of carpal tunnel syndrome if you tried to use it. Luckily, you can easily make it go away.]---Overall, had I actually paid for this Dell, I'd be pretty satisfied with it. It's not the most impressive or flawless laptop, but it's fast, efficient, and easy to tote around.","rating":4},{"comment":"First impressions were very positive, at least as far as the machine itself.  The burnished silver finish just looks and feels like quality.  I was, however, moderately disappointed to see there was no paper instructions at all.  No big deal for me and perhaps not expected these days.  It can be a problem, however, for the non-computer-savvy consumer who may be considering this product, given its relatively low price for performance ratio.I do enjoy the large 17&#34; HD+ display and have enjoyed several movies which have all looked great. The built-in sound is quite nice and the 1TB hard drive offers plenty of space.  There is also a built-in Bluetooth, a DVD drive, an HDMI port, a USB 2.0 and a USB 3.0 port.  The unit is large but surprisingly light for its size.The only problem I have experienced so far has been the w-fi dropping out periodically.  I can be running another laptop right next to this one and the other purrs right on through while this one drops out.  I have done some initial investigating of drivers but all seems up-to-date.Overall, this is a pretty darn good laptop for the price.  You will certainly find better units out there but it will cost you.","rating":4},{"comment":"I'm giving this Inspiron laptop five stars for some reasons I'll detail below.  I wanted to start off by saying that I'm sure you can get overall better five star laptops, but at this price, I think this a high value machine and definitely worth five stars. (I bought an HP recently that is probably a better machine, but the price was double this.) The last Dell I bought was for my wife about five years ago.  Probably about the same price, only 15&#34; in size, nowhere near the hardware quality and felt like a cheap plastic toy by comparison.I've owned a lot of Dell laptops over the years, and they've had some ups and downs in quality.  Overall, this feels very solid and sturdy.  The brushed aluminum finish is really nice, and the keyboard is much better than some Dell keyboards I've seen in recent years where the keys would occasionally pop off.One of the most impressive things about this laptop to me is the size::weight.  I own and still regularly use a 17&#34; Inspiron that is probably eight years old.  (I'm a programmer, and I hate changing machines.)  That laptop is more than twice as thick as this and I'm sure is twice as heavy.  I cannot believe how thin and light this machine is with a 17&#34; screen.  Amazing.  I LOVE the 17&#34; screen.  If you use your laptop for work, you know how important that screen space is, and how this effectively replaces the need for a desktop.  If you are using it for entertainment, you will love the bigger screen to watch movies or Netflix or whatever.  It may be a little bulkier to carry around, but for me personally I love the extra size.Some quick pro's\/con's to help you make your decision:PROS:- huge 17&#34; HD+ display, movies looked great, netflix looked great- built-in sound is really impressive.- 1TB hard drive, plenty of space- built-in bluetooth, DVD drive, HDMI port, USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports- sturdy construction, solid keyboard- large but LIGHT!CONS:- I still despise Windows 8.1 but that's not Dell's fault.  Seriously the worst Windows I have ever seen.- The location of the keyboard is a little weird compared to my other 17&#34; laptop.  Dell has taken up a lot of space with a large touchpad and moved the keyboard way up high near the screen.  Its not horrible, I'm just finding I have to get used to the change.- included 4-cell battery you can probably do better with.  Advertises 5 hours of battery life but I'm not sure about that.  I'm guessing you can probably upgrade that battery and I would recommend checking that out if you buy this laptop.- not a lot of additional software included.  Trial version of office.  Wasn't an issue for me, but just something to be aware of.Lastly, I highly recommend purchasing the three year warranty.  No offense to Dell, but with most of my previous machines I have had to use the warranty for one thing or another.  They are really good about helping you out when the machine is under warranty in my experience.Hope this helps!  Feel free to post any questions, and I will try to answer.","rating":5},{"comment":"I bought a less expensive Dell 17.3 inch Inspiron laptop (Pentium 2127U 1.9 GHz) in March so this gave me a good basis for comparison. This one in comparison has a Intel Core i5 1.7 GHz processor.Presentation: This laptop has a brushed silver finish. (The other has a textured finish that feels more substantial.) There's gaps between the keys that food or dust can fall in. Apart from that, they're pretty similar.OS: This comes with the 8.1 which I'm very familiar with by now. Anyone who wants to use the older Windows7 can use the workaround, but I also have a Windows phone so I'm used to the tiles as well. No biggie at all.Speed: This laptop is excellent. It's used mainly for games (TF2) and Netflix. There is absolutely no lag at all, even using the highest settings with games or videos, providing you have a good connection of course. In fact, one of the best things I love about this laptop is the quality of the picture, it really is outstanding and the screen is just so big.Specs: The specs are all posted above so I won't repost them here. I miss the VGA port but it has an HDMI port so I just need a converter for that. And it doesn't have a mic jack, but again, I have a USB converter plug for that.One complaint\/annoyance I had was that in the setup, I was required to have a Microsoft account which I don't and didn't want to get. After fooling around with it for a while, I managed to get around it without setting up a MS account.Other thoughts: It's pretty lightweight for it's size. Battery life is decent. It's thin. I wish it had a textured finish, which is harder to scratch and I think looks better. I wish the keyboard was sealed. It doesn't have a lot of ports but you can buy all sorts of USB attachments and hubs to fix that. Sound quality is not that great but I have good external speakers. Having Bluetooth is great, I can connect external speakers quickly and easily without wires. I like it that it stays pretty cool and doesn't have a noisy fan like my older laptops. I'm not a fan of the 1 piece touchpad, still getting used to it. Camera quality is not the best. Spacebar is loud. That's all the small stuff.So overall, what is the verdict? I like it because it's fast and has good quality screen. Because this laptop is used mainly for games and videos\/movies, those are the important things. The important things are that it loads up fast and picture quality is good. The small stuff, like lack of ports can all be fixed with hubs and USB plug ins. The operating system, which many people don't like is just another thing to get used to, Microsoft has been changing OS on us whether we like it or not for years.Overall, very satisfied with it. A fast computer with a large good quality screen.","rating":5},{"comment":"I would give this laptop a 4 1\/2 stars, but since Amazon only allows whole numbers I have to steer to the 4 start mark. This was a good product for the most part.Out the box there were no real instructions or manual to help with set up. In addition, there was no additional software included with this laptop. In most cases, when you purchase a new computer or laptop, there is a software package that comes with it. This was not the case for this Dell Laptop. it did come with a 30-day free trial of Microsoft Office 2013, but this is something anyone can get by downloading from the Microsoft site. It also came with a 30-Day-McAfee trial. Thank God I have Norton multi-device software.The screen is large and I actually have to say that I use the laptop now more than my desk top.It has 3 USB ports which makes it easy to attach a mouse, external storage drive and an additional USB item.The sound on this laptop without headphones or speakers leaves much to be desired. However, when you input headphones or a desktop speaker system, the sound on this toy is incredible.It is a bit heavy (for me), but I like that I can work anywhere I want and not be stuck to my desk.I mentioned that the screen was big, 17 inches. It has tons of memory and internal hard drive space.I like that this laptop has a 10 key, keypad to the left. I use Photoshop a lot and this helps when putting in code.I've only  had this laptop for about three weeks now and during the 1st week, the battery life was awesome, now I am finding that the battery doesn't hold a charge like it used to.If I had to pick ONE thing I don't like about this laptop is the the mouse\/pad. I type 100 wpm without looking at the keyboard and this particular board does not have raised left and right mouse buttons. So I find myself clicking the right often when I'm trying to click the left. If they could change this, this would almost be a perfect laptop for its price range.","rating":4},{"comment":"This 17.3\" Dell laptop replaces my 15\" Dell Inspiron which crashed after 4 years of heavy use.  I was a bit hesitant about a 17.3\" for a laptop, but I do love it (cat hates it - less lap space for him). This laptop, although wider, isn't any heavier than my 15\" and is also thinner.The Backlit Display with Truelife and HD+ resolution is so sharp and wonderful. Watching a movie or viewing photos and videos is a joy with this computer. I love the keyboard as well -- looks very sleek yet solid and not the type of keyboard that you'll have to worry about popping off the keys when something gets stuck underneath.Set up was easy. The battery stays charged longer than my previous Dell, and although I heard a lot of negatives about Windows 8.1 -- it is different, but I like it a lot.  I am a little nervous about setting up iTunes as I heard that was a little tricky -- I'll try it when I am on vacation. Personally, I would not tote around a 17.3\"laptop, but I love it for all the reasons stated above. Would make a great replacement computer for anyone wishing to make the switch from desktop to laptop.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this laptop.

As soon as I connected my phone to each, the cable was recognized and charging began.I'm not real big on &#34;killing&#34; my battery on my devices, but I noticed that even from a 50% charge the cable would work just like the Apple product and charged at the same speed for each of my chargers.  A comparison of both OEM and Anker cables over the past week almost made me think that Anker just rebranded the Apple cable.  I was really impressed with the quality.The packaging of the cable was very nice.  Many of the cables I have ordered in the past came in a plastic back.  Anker product arrived in a small cardboard box and wrapped neatly inside.  Very well presented and that is saying a lot for a cable.  My only major worry, if I were buying this, is how much did I pay for the packaging?  It was a nice way to present the cable, but overall I think it was wasteful...I love the product though, does exactly what it should do: Charge my devices.

I have bought a few Anker products since my first time asking whether their iPhone\/Android battery charger was a stupid idea. The company is really great (they actually replaced a mildly defective product immediately--with no questions asked--and all of the things I have bought from them are very well made.This cable is no exception. I needed an extra iPhone cable, and the thought of forking out $30 + shipping was not one I liked. Amazon Basics has some good cables (I have tried that brand before and have not been disappointed) but when I saw this MUCH cheaper--and made by Anker I had to try it. It is about 10-20% more sturdy than the one that came with my iPhone. I have replaced several iPod cables over the years, so I was being proactive this time. If I ever had to buy another cable, I have to stay with Anker. The price is amazing and they really do build quality stuff. This cable has excellent reinforcements at both ends of each plug, and while it feels thicker than my &#34;official&#34; iPhone lightning cable, it is a small annoyance, and I like the extra durability. It is less flexible than the one that came with the phone though, so that may be a turn off (it feels less sexy--kind of like a Buick compared to a Porsche) and it has the word ANKER stamped in silver at each end. But if you are not a die-hard fashionista, save yourself $10-$20 and get this. It will outlast the one Apple sends you.Anyway, thanks for reading this.

It is well known that Apple has broken with protocol with this connector and incorporates a chip which, among other things, requires that only adapters sold under the Apple brand or those which Apple as \"certified\" be used. Certified? A simple way of defining certified is that if a non-Apple seller wants their product to work with a newer generation iPhone, iPad or certain other devices that they pay a fee to Apple to get a compatibility code that they can use to register their adapter. That makes it a little hard for smaller companies to compete price-wise against Apple.But yet there are a few of those smaller companies that are brave enough to compete on Apple's terms and offer accessories equal to or sometimes slightly superior to Apple itself.Anker has jumped into the fray and has joined that small band of accessory sellers to offer a cable that is truly compatible with Apple Lightning devices. How does it compare?So far I have only tested 3 Lightning cables sourced from reputable companies ... Apple itself, Amazon Basics and now Anker.The Apple cable sells for $19.00 and is rarely if ever discounted. The Amazon cable, like most of their Basics line, is also sold at a fixed price which for this cable is $13.99.  Anker's cable was selling for $9.95 at the time I got it but Anker does have a tendency to adjust their prices from time to time (the latest I checked it was $11.99Visually they look very similar, Apple-white of course. The body of the three cables are similar to each other, the Apple and the Anker feeling identical while the Amazon cable is quite hefty at about twice as thick.  It is at the ends that each has charted its own course and where the biggest differences lie.While the Lightning and USB connectors themselves are identical, of course, which they have to be for compatibility, the molded caps are by far the biggest difference between the three brands. The Amazon caps are massive in comparison, certain to create major issues when attempting to use that cable with certain cases or receptacle connectors that are recessed. While the Apple cap is just barely larger than the connector itself the Amazon cap is approximately twice as thick at the lightning side and gigantic at the UBS side. The Anker caps are much closer in size to the Apple with the Lightning end being fractionally thicker (it makes no sense why they would choose to do this) and the USB end also being thicker but appearing to be about normal for USB cables.Usually the length of the end cap isn't a concern but it is worth noting here that again at the Lightning side Amazon's is muchlarger than the other two brands and does not have a strain relief which could cause the cable to break at that point. Anker has an adequate but Apple's is twice as long. The exact same thing is true about the strain reliefs at the USB end.So, who is the winner? There is no contest that Apple wins. Yes it is expensive but it is just plain better and you are buying the confidence that Apple themselves is certifying that it will be compatible. However, and this is a big however, Anker comes in at second place in a contest that is almost too close to call. Unless you have a situation where the Anker won't physically fit your case there is no other reason not to consider it an exact replacement for the Apple-branded cable ... at about half the price. As for the Amazon private label brand? It loses on every point and comes in dead last.This review is based on the OEM cable that was packed with my iPad compared to cables provided for testing by Amazon and Anker. The opinions expressed are my own.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have used Anker lightning cable for 1 week and felt that this cable is better than Apple OEM and amazon basics lightning cable.

YAY!I usually buy Monoprice cables because of their lifetime guarantee but since I love Anker, I decided to check this cable out to compare it with the Monoprice and the standard Apple cable. Anker provides an 18 month warranty and lifetime user support.This review is for the 36&#34; Usb\/Lightning cable. As always, this Anker product comes packaged nicely in a brown box with a nice white label.The USB end and the lightning connector end is much thicker than the other cable ends. It seems more durable. Time will tell. This cable does what it says it will do- it connects without giving you the error message that &#34;This accessory is not designed for this device&#34;. No problems getting power immediately.Apple's lightning cable costs $17.49 while the Monoprice cable is $12.09 before shipping. This Anker cable is $15.99 on Amazon so it is about the same cost as the Monoprice cable, but without the lifetime guarantee. Anker has great customer service and I would be willing to bet that even though the cable doesn't have a lifetime guarantee, they would probably be willing to work something out if the cable fails outside of the 18 month warranty period. This cable does look durable enough that there shouldn't be any problems with it.I did a short test of all three cables to see if any of them charged significantly faster or slower. I plugged in each cable to the same USB charger and timed how long it took to get to 7% charge increase. I did the test when my phone was streaming music at a 50% charge. If you do the test, just make sure that you keep all of the conditions the same and that you collect the data in the middle area of the battery life because as it gets more empty or full, the battery percentage meter is slightly less accurate. All three cables charged at a rate of 3% in about 3+ minutes with the Anker cable being slightly faster. It took the Anker cable 7 minutes and 10 seconds to charge 7% while it took the Monoprice cable 7 minutes and 30 seconds. The Apple cable took 7 minutes and 26 seconds to charge the battery 7%. If you calculate the 15 seconds difference, it amounts to 3 and a half minutes faster for a 100% charge. I don't really see that as a selling point, but the Anker cable did charge slightly faster than the others.The price is right for this cable. Why are you thinking so much- it's just a cable.

It's always a great time to have in the car, backpack, or even lying around just in case you don't feel like going upstairs back to your laptop. Anker realizes this and have successfully accomplished a cable that both works perfectly and is economically sound.Currently, I am a developer for Apple, so I am on iOS 8 for my iPhone 5s. I took the liberty to test the cable on the newer OS and it worked just as smooth as it did on my iPhone 5 and iPad Air (and 4th gen) running iOS 7. What's even better is how much faster the iPads can be charged with this new cable as compared to the OEM issued one from Apple. This is a HUGE added benefit when you need juice and don't have much time to wait.I've used cables that are not MFi certified, and they are simply just a hassle to navigate with. &#34;This accessory may not be supported&#34; is one message that will come taunt you every time you try to charge your Apple device. Anker has taken care of this by establishing a unique serial to each and every cable to ensure that this issue does not arise when you are charging your Apple devices.A $10 cable that is also Apple MFi Certified is a deal to take advantage of! What's better is that it comes form a company that you can trust. I've used countless Anker products and their customer service has always helped me when I needed advice or a replacement.What would I like to see from this cable? Maybe a different color -- black would be awesome! Maybe a 6ft version as well (the 3ft is the same size as my current Apple OEM). Just a couple suggestions that Anker could consider.Disclaimer: I received this product from Anker for my honest feedback.","rating":5},{"comment":"This cable has USB on one end and Lightning on the other end.

Dlink fixed it after I went to their support forum. I'm mostly satisfied with the plugs now.  The lack of web portal functionality and the inability for this thing to figure out DST in your timezone are still some minor issues. But once they are up and going, they've been  consistent in operation for the last week and some of the issues with tablet vs Phone android devices have shaken out.Also, if you notice  in the comments of this review, DLink support offered help, but after I filled in the form they gave me, no one followed up with me.  I had better luck using the support forum setup for the smartplugs specifically and getting a dlink response to fix the update problem.Overall some of my problems are probably just because I bought these at release, but there's plenty of functionality in these for just an outlet. as soon as they fix the DST thing and offer web portal functionality instead of the app, it'll be pretty close to 5 star rating.----------Original Review---------------------Bought three of these recently.The interface is good, but works inconsistently on my different android devices.  I can see that they want to make this more like the NEST learning thermostat, but there's a lot of bugs in the android app.  I don't think the plugs themselves are the problem since the cloud portal seems to connect to them no problem.  I guess this is one issue being an early adopter.When I first got the plugs, I plugged them in and fired up the app on my phone(HTC one M8). weirdly, it let me setup the plug, but refused to let me register for a new DLINK cloud account and there's no way to register outside the app.  Kept giving me a generic error, \"can not create account\" with no indication why. uninstalled the app reinstalled, reset devices to  factory defaults.... same thing.  So then I reset everything and tried using my tablet instead  (ASUS transformer) and it let me setup the devices with no problems and the account as well. strangely though, the app refuses to connect to one of the plugs. so then I go back to my phone, log into the dlink cloud in the app and the phone has no problem communicating with all the plugs consistently.DLINK support is atrocious. I wanted to contact support about my issues, but when you use the support link from the plug page calling them and emailing them are grayed out. I'm using the latest chrome for my browsers I only had the option to use chat and that was an automated robot chat and not a live person.  There's basically no info on these plugs yet, so the automated chat function was worthless. I couldn't find a number  to simply call up support very easily.The reports of how much power is  being used is great as well as the other features such as temperature monitoring and different alerts you can set.  The scheduling is easy and a lot like NEST learning Thermostat if you have one of those. Updating the firmware has not worked as the app told me there's new firmware  available and asked if I wanted to update my plugs, I hit yes, it says downloading and upgrading but after they reboot they are still at the old version they came with out of the box.Also, another nit, why can't this thing not figure out DST in your timezone? it makes scheduling and reporting a bit off.Another thing that's strange and what I'd consider a fault with the product is that you can't use the Cloud web interface to program the plugs or enable options and such.  Scheduling, reading your reports, and configuration all has to be  done from the app. and since the app is currently inconsistent in  operation, that can make things a bit tough.Right now I think they have some great ideas in here, but some bugs need to be worked out and the online portal functionality needs to  be improved.  Basic functionality and scheduling seem to work fine.  I'll update this review after I've had them for a couple of weeks and let you know if they operated consistently on the schedules I set or if there are any improvements in later versions of the app if fixes come out.","rating":3},{"comment":"The product might be ok in a few releases. Seems to still be in beta test. Apps are buggy, little or no help in the apps or on the web.  The price point of the device is very high for something that has such limited functionality and at this point so buggy.  You can get Dlink's lower end web cam for $32 so $59 for the power plug is silly.  The plug needs to be at $19 to $24 max and it would be worthwhile.  I am not going to send it back, but will wait a while to see if updates help to get it to perform as it should for its cost.  Calling support it worthless, long waits and no call backs.  You are really on your own with this power plug.","rating":2},{"comment":"---Update: 6-17-2014---After about 1 week of usage, the D-Link android app no longer displayed the several smart plugs I installed, even though these devices are listed on mydlink account.  I removed the smart plugs from mydlink account and reinstalled all them over again, but all the same.  After I exited and relaunched the app, they all disappeared.  It looks like there are some nasty bugs in the Android app they have yet to fix.  I really can't afford to spend any more time on this half-baked product.  I'll send them packaging back to Amazon.  Too bad, I really wanted them to work.I called D-Link tech support, but it was an exercise in frustration, since these first-tier support folks obviously have zero experience using the product they are supposed to provide support for.  I said I was using the Android D-Link Smart plug app, but he kept talking about the iPhone.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Frankly, I didn't have much of an expectation given my bad experience with the poor execution of Smart Plug's competitor, WEMO.  The initial setup on my Android tablet went quite smoothly until I got to the point of creating a mydlink account for remotely controlling the Smart Plug. It kept giving me a \"cannot create account\" error message.  I went back and tried to reconnect the device and for some reason I was able to create an account with the Smart Plug app.  (Note that you cannot just create an account online on your own; you have to do it using the app. associated with your D-Link device.) And if you update the firmware, you will have problems reconnecting it.  What I did was to clear the existing data from the app, unplug the Smart Plug and plug it back in.  Everything seems to be working fine now.There are two things that D-Link needs to do at this point:(a) Iron out the wrinkles on their app and\/or their firmware to make the installation process problem-free.(b) Lower the price points a bit if they want this to be more popular or gain more market share before everybody else floods the market with this type of product.  $50 apiece is quite steep.","rating":2},{"comment":"I bought these on a lark.  I can live without them, but I thought I'd give them a try.  I connected one to a lamp in my Family Room, and another to a lamp over my computer in my office.The set up was pretty easy until I tried updating the firmware. Whether using the Android app (Nexus 5) or the IOS (iPad Air) the firmware update just wouldn't take.  I tired using Chat, but it wanted a cookie.  I then tired emailing, but that failed to work. I called and spoke to someone in Manila.  Hard to understand and after an hour of doing what she said to do, she said I'd need to be elevated. She said I'd get a call the next day.  Two days later, I got a call from D-Link. I picked up after two rings, and it hung up. I haven't heard from them since.As for the usefulness, it works fine controlling those two lamps once the connection has been established. Upon starting the lamp it takes about 20 seconds to connect; not very useful for a on the fly light switch.It also worked when I was away from my home. I turned on the lamp in my office while across town, and sure enough when I got home it was on.  I can see the usefulness when out of town and want to turn on and off lighting to make it appear the home is occupied.As soon as I can figure out where to put another, I'll order one again...","rating":4},{"comment":"Cannot be trusted for outlets that can never turn off. I have had these units switch the power off on their own while hooked to a circuit that powered a computer. Perfect for non-critical plugs, but do not plug your fridge into one of these.","rating":2},{"comment":"I purchased this speaker on 6\/1\/14 and got it today 6\/3\/14 with AMAZON Prime.Out of the box:Basic, quality box with 3.5mm auxiliary cable and a charging cable.Build quality:Rubberized and metal grill give it a classy professional durable look and feel.Sound quality:Good, don't expect BOSE clarity and BEATS bass. This does get loud compared to my iPhone and laptop. Will rock my entire house!Price:$60 is more than fair for this piece of equipment!Whats lacking:The round cover that covers the ON\/OFF switch, charger, and auxiliary port is connected to the main unit through a rubbery cable that can pop on and off. To get it back in, you must pop a round head into a tiny hole (oh hush).All in all a quality piece for the workshop, small parties, shower, or anywhere else you could think of!Check out my review for this here: http:\/\/youtu.be\/huiMXYLaDa4 (YouTube: NapalmicAcid)","rating":4},{"comment":"Here's the thing, you can't compare the sound quality to a $300 Bose or SONOS, but for $60 you're getting a very good speaker.  I was just getting ready to pull the trigger on a Soundscape 8 by Photive but then saw this in the Amazon recommendations.  If the speaker was staying pretty stationary I would have gotten the Soundscape (same price, higher wattage speakers), but this thing might go from the garage, to the bathroom, to the beach all in the same day so I went with the Rugged version.It's built well, very solid.  Has a rubber cover all but the speaker side and doesn't feel loose or cheap.  It's not submersible.  The packaging states it can take &#34;strong direct water blasts&#34;.  So basically &#34;very water resistant&#34;, just don't expect to take it to the bottom of your pool and listen to some tunes.  I was a little surprised with the end cap.  It's not very secure.  I expect that the charging and 3.5mm port are waterproof as well, even with out the cap covering them.  I expected some sort of screw on cap with a rubber O-Ring, but if the ports are waterproof, that I guess it doesn't matter.For a rugged speaker, I would have liked to see some sort of retractable ring or loop that I could hook a carabiner too or something, so I could hang it from the pop up tent, beach cart, shower head, backpack, etc.I'm no audiophile so it's hard to comment on sound quality.  I expect that most of these speakers in the this price range are close to the same.  Does it have the bass or the room dominance that a $300-$400 system is going to have, definitely not.  But I think it's probably a better buy than a $100 unit.  It will fill a room, patio, even a good portion of a backyard but you're not rattling the neighbors windows with it.  Overall, I'm happy.Also, Photive actually called a week after my purchase to see how I like it.  Thought that was kind of odd, to get a call directly to my cell, from a private number (that I accidentally answered).  Very non-invasive, just making sure I was happy with it, so no big deal.  I guess this version has only been out for a short time, so they're making sure everything is good.","rating":4},{"comment":"Just got the Photive HYDRA out of the box today.  This is great.  Well worth the money and much more cost-effective than Jambox or Beats.  For your money you get sound as loud as you want it, with no distortion.  It's also easy to pair, and appears to be well-built.Granted for $60 you're not going to get Bose or Sonos quality, or something loud enough for your neighbors half a mile down the road to enjoy.  But this is a VERY competitive product that gives excellent bang for the buck and IMHO compares reasonably well to my $200 Bose Sound Mini.I've been playing it for an hour and I am pleased with it.  I have read good things about Photive products and this definitely lives up to its promise.  At least for now.Caveat: I still need to test it in a &#34;damp&#34; environment, and will adjust my rating accordingly once I do.  I'd also like to see how I feel about this a month from now.  But, there have been few bluetooth speakers I've been this happy with out of the box.  And, even aside from the water resistance I'd recommend this for Bluetooth 4.0 and longer playing time.","rating":5},{"comment":"The HYDRA is much smaller than I imagined.  I probably would not have purchased it if I actually read the dimensions and looked closer at the pictures.  I am a gadget guy and have many bluetooth devices including speakers.  I like the HYDRA but it has some constraints.  Because it is smaller, it does not produce that rich deep sound. Very tingy or tin can like.  The speaker is fine for what it is and seems to be constructed very well.  I kept the speaker because it does have its purpose.  I also have a JBL Charge. Now the Charge is more than twice the price but it also gives you more than twice the sound. For smaller rooms and uses, the HYDRA will work just fine for most people. Ease of use was great.","rating":3},{"comment":"I was looking for a speaker I could take to the beach and also use during workouts at home, so far this speaker has more than pleased me. First off this speaker can get pretty loud! It'll fill a whole backyard or large room with music. The speaker sounds great with all styles of music, even bass heavy music. I love how I can take this speaker anywhere I go, even if it's pouring outside. This speaker is built to last, well that's how it feels. It has this rubber feel all around it except the front, the front is made out of some sort of metal. The seal on the side is pretty good but it's hard to know for sure if it's sealed all the way.The Bluetooth functionality works like a charm, most of the time... Sometimes the music skips or breaks up even if my phone is right next to the speaker. Also sometimes the speaker can only be ten feet away from the source of music. Usually the speaker works great using Bluetooth but sometimes it will have problems. After all you don't have to use it with Bluetooth as it comes with a Aux cord although I noticed with my phone \"Samsung Mega\" It gets louder on Bluetooth than it will with cable attached..The Bluetooth wireless Call quality works like a charm and is actually really handy if you have your own office. I've used it a few times and it sounds better and gets much louder than my phone.Pros:Build Quality is excellent!Sound Quality is the best you're going to find in this price range!It gets pretty loud.It's water resistant, just don't submerge it and it'll be fine.Super easy to use and take with you anywhere.Cons:Bluetooth doesn't work perfect all the time.The Seal could be better.Sound does crack every now and then if turned up to highest volume.","rating":4},{"comment":"I bought this as an replacement for my Hipe speaker which after 15 months fell to the flaw it has of the charger connector falling into the speaker.The Photive Hydra is a much better product. It's box packaging echos that of Apple's. It comes with a Aux cable and a micro USB charging cable. Charging took four and a half hours instead of the five listed in the manual. You can play it while it's charging so I tested it out. It connected via Bluetooth after downloading and installing the driver but once that was done it's connected flawlessly.  The sound is amazing and loud. I had to turn it down twice in fear that it was too loud which never happened with my old Hipe.

It appears it will satisfy my need for a durable, good sounding, portable speaker I can take to the beach and fishing. Pairing with my mobile was very simple and, after charging it up all the way before I turned it on, it has now been playing for 6 hours without even a pause. This is \"good stuff\" and I highly recommend this speaker to anyone who enjoys the outdoors and is seeking a little music to take along with you.Update: have taken this in the shower, to the beach, fishing and to a friend's back yard cook-out; it has performed flawlessly. I was especially impressed using it in the \"open air\" environment while fishing and at the beach. While it won't shake the woods or rattle the sunglasses of other beach goers (saw many nearby tapping their toes.. LOL), it does pack more than enough sound definition and volume to enjoy anything from the Zeppelin to Sam Smith; Diana Krall to Keith Urban; Stravinsky to Jackson. GOOD, GOOD, GOOD STUFF!","rating":5},{"comment":"This speaker has wonderful sound for the price!  I demo'ed the Bose and other items.  For under $75 I would go with this unit EVERY time.

I do NOT regret this purchase.The package arrived on time-I used prime for 2 day shipping.Everything you need it in the box:- speaker- USB charger- 3.5 &#8220;headphone&#8221; cable- destructionIt charged pretty well via my laptop with a USB 3.0 port. It also charged great when I used my Samsung wall charger for an AC plug. I didn&#8217;t time the charge but it does take a few hours to fully charge. Normally I charge things overnight when I need them the next day. Also, it DOES play audio when you&#8217;re charging it. This was a selling point to me as well.It feels like it is built pretty solid. I like the rubber-ish feel of the exterior. I feel I can have a slightly better grip on it when my hands are wet or the unit gets splashed.This is a perfect lead into the water test. I DID NOT dunk test it. I&#8217;d rather be pleasantly surprised when it survives a quick dip in the pool or lake. I did take it in the shower and splash it was water. It performed like a champ. This helped my confidence when it came time for the boat. Sorry, no fantastic story from the boat ride. It didn&#8217;t have an issue with water which is a major reason as to why I bought this unit.The sound is pretty damn good. It DOES fill a room pretty easily. It also works well for tailgates. No, you can&#8217;t host a block party with it, but its small size allows it to be placed near a few people or around a group. The sound is what I would expect from a device such as this one. No REAL big bass, which is fine. It plays the audio far better than my note 3&#8217;s speaker. I mostly use this for tailgates and pool side so this isn&#8217;t a problem.I did use it on a boat on the lake. It performed well. The engine was louder and the max audio wasn&#8217;t able to hang but that is to be expected. I was impressed for how well it did with the motor going.I have used both Bluetooth and the cable with great results both ways. I synced it with ny Note 3 and my laptop with no problems.Overall I think for the price this is a GREAT deal. It does perform well when splashed. It also has a great sound that&#8217;s perfect for the pool, a small room, or even a tailgate. HIGHLY recommend it.","rating":5},{"comment":"What more can be said about a device that you get out of the box, charge it using a micro-USB connector, and pair with your favorite Bluetooth device to pump room filling sound out?  Oh yeah -- it can be taken into the shower or used by the pool with no worries!Audio quality is reasonably good, but don't expect to be rocking to deep bass notes.  The speaker is small and well constructed with good waterproofing.  (As others observe, it's not &#34;waterproof&#34; to the degree you'd want to take it swimming.  It's not an underwater speaker.)  For applications where incidental exposure to water might kill lesser speakers, the HYDRA is a great choice.","rating":5},{"comment":"Works great.  Lot more powerful sound than I expected.  If it had a little more bass, I wouldn't have much of a need for a regular stereo.  Amazing how such a small speaker can put out such great sound.  Also, the bluetooth worked amazingly well.

Great product at a great price","rating":5},{"comment":"I am using this on a dell laptop that is running Windows 8.1. It was very simple to install and only took a minute or two. Simply plug in the USB receiver, put batteries in the mouse, turn it on and run the driver \/ software installation disk that comes with it. It's also supposed to work with Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows 7 but I am unable to test those operating systems.This gaming mouse is large and your whole hand sits on it. It's designed to be ergonomic and its quite comfortable. It has an area for your thumb and your index and middle finger sits on the left and right buttons. Then there is even an area for your last two fingers. Then it has a button on the bottom that you can push and adjust the area that your thumb rests on. It moves in or out to three different positions. The top of the mouse is sharp an modern looking. It's mostly black with chrome trim and gray lines across it at different angles. The USB receiver dongle is very tiny so if you are using it on a laptop that you carry around it won't get in the way at all.On the bottom you will find a button that you push to give you access to the battery compartment. It operates on two AAA batteries and you should get months of use out of a set of batteries under normal condition. It includes a set of batteries to get you started. There is a button on the top of this mouse that will quickly take your cursor straight to the middle of your screen. The scroll wheel is smooth and quiet and doesn't make as much noise as many that I have used. The two main buttons make the same amount of noise as most others do. This is an optical mouse so no red laser and it works very smoothly.The installation disk will install software that will allow you to customize the buttons on the mouse if you so desire. You can adjust things like scroll speed, double click speed, tracking speed and what every button on the mouse does. This mouse is a little more expensive than some of the competition but it has loads of features that make it an awesome mouse to use. I can't really think of anything that I would change about this mouse and really like using it.Sample provided for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"Yes it has an unusual shape, but is very comfortable. I have a medium sized hand and it fits well.Rather than being &#34;for a large hand&#34;, it is more that it supports your whole hand. I find the ring and pinkie finger rest very comfortable. You can rest your hand on this mouse.The thumb rest has three positions, flush, medium, and fully extended. The picture shows it fully &#34;out&#34;.The force required to click is medium, which works well for me as I have found many mice to be far too sensitive for me resulting in accidental clicks.If you like Microsoft comfort mice, I think you will like this.","rating":5},{"comment":"I received this mouse as a review sample and spent some quality time with it before sitting down to write this review. I'll get one caveat out of the way first, along with a disclosure.The overall feel of this will take some getting use to. The form factor is like nothing I have used in the past. What I love is the efficiency that is incorporated into the design, To use an analogy this is like a Dvorak keyboard compared to a QWERTY one. The Dvorak is far superior in efficiency, but the QWERTY has a certain familiarity that keeps it around.My hands are somewhat small, so part of my learning curve came from the initial awkwardness I experienced. As I used this mouse, though, I started liking it because it does promote efficiency.Aside from the ergonomic aspects, the design is also clever from an engineering perspective. The dongle is tiny and stores neatly inside the battery compartment. The side component that extends out on the right side when you press a button on the bottom gives you an intuitive means of going forward and back at the press of buttons. Or more accurately, pressure on the buttons - after you become accustomed to it.Other features that I love is the ability to home the cursor to the center of the screen using the center button, Of course, the precise control over positioning and mousing this provides is one of the main reasons why I gave it five stars. I may be an easy grader, but when a product inspires me to actually use it and enjoy the experience, and it's well designed and made, I give it my highest rating.Bottom line: if you are replacing your mouse and are looking for something immediately familiar, this may not be the one for you. If you love experimenting and are always seeking a better and more efficient way to do things, this may be perfect for you. As for me, I am still getting use to it, so the jury is out. If I do decide to not use it, it's because of personal preferences because this is everything it's claimed to be.","rating":5},{"comment":"I received this unit free in exchange for a review.  As usual I will give it my absolutely candid feedback anyway.* The feel of this mouse is rather bizarre.  It has the sensation of a glove more than a mouse.  It wants to give all five fingers somewhere to rest.  That's... well, that takes some getting used to.* Setup is quick and easy.  Just plug in the dongle (which very cleverly stores inside the battery compartment) and Windows figures out the rest.* Design is sharp and clever.  I'm still somewhat on the fence but this might replace my previous mouse.* That weird looking thing on the left side, that slides in and out depending on how wide your hand is.* Standard programmable buttons and such* Two extra buttons on the top; one brings the mouse pointer to the center of the screen.  Interesting but too awkward to use honestly.  Also in a dual monitor situation it brings the pointer to the center of the primary window, not the current window the pointer happens to be in.In summary, a solid mouse but be prepared for the idea that this thing wants your WHOLE hand and will never give it back.","rating":5},{"comment":"Easy to setup. Finding the wireless USB plug  acn be hard.\/ I serached for over 5 minutes and it is hidden inside the mouse. 2 AAA batteries.

Sample provided for a fair and honest review.","rating":5},{"comment":"The mouse looks like something out of a Star Wars movie or futuristic drawing. It installs easily ( I didn't use the software) and is pre-paired between the mouse and the wireless receiver (which is housed in the mouse bay by the batteries).There is one aspect that can be seen as a positive or a negative: The mouse is extremely light weight, especially for a full sized mouse. I often prefer one that is a bit heavier, but I can see where this could be really good for people with wrist issues or who cannot move around much weight on the desk. That's personal preference.The second item is also per-person: My right fingers don't want to lie right where they've designed for them to go. I don't chock this up to a design issue, but to the fact that I'm used to using mobile mice all the time, and somewhat stopped using desktop mice.Overall, usage was accurate, with no wireless stutters or issues, and the mouse was quite reliable. It is a great value for what you get.By a lot of patient hours, days and years of reviewing, I found myself in the top reviewers on Amazon. This wasn't a goal or result of self promotion, but by focused reviewing. I sometimes get contacted by manufacturers or sellers who ask that I provide an unbiased review.

The weight is good, lighter than I ever expected.  The expansion capability makes me happy as I am able to store bigger files without worrying about the smaller internal 8GB memory.  Overall, for this price, I have very few complaints.  In fact, the screen may be the best I've seen in one of these smaller tablet computers.This little tablet feels pretty solid and beefy for what it is, the quality is obvious.The initial charge took me about 1.5 hours and the battery life seems ok...not great.  I've been playing with it since I received it and have had to plug it in once to recharge.  I didn't get the full 5.5 hours it promised, but I did get well over four hours.The print app works really well.  In fact everything I've tried has been stellar.  The camera takes nice photos as long as you have good light.  Low light doesn't work well.  The photos aren't high definition, which is fine for me.  I'm older and no one wants to see me in high definition.  For better pictures I simply use my iPad or phone.  The photos on this don't compare, but neither does the price tag.My greatest complaint, my ONLY complaint for this low price is the glaring absence of Bluetooth.  I've remedied that with a Bluetooth adaptor that transmits to my Bluetooth speakers, however if I didn't already own one that I use with my prehistoric iPod, it would have been another $40 investment.  If Bluetooth is important to you, you might consider going with the slightly more expensive version of this tablet that offers it.  Otherwise, the headphone jack works fine.I will be uploading a video shortly to try to show the features and quality.","rating":4},{"comment":"Just bought it yesterday, I also own a Nexus 7 .I've seen a lot of people putting this down but I really like it !for 99 bucks its pretty hard to beat.

It was on sale for eighty five dollars through HP's website. I figured I can't go wrong for the price and was not expecting too much given the cost. I own a few ipads and an Asus Memo HD7 so have others to compare with.I was very impressed with this tablets construction, metal back, great screen colors and fine resolution. It does feel like a quality product to me, the build is nearer the Apple products I own rather than the Asus tab. It does not seem to be slow on general android programs but I have not tried it on graphic intense games which I suspect it won't win any awards for but I did not buy it for that reason.The other neat thing is it is backed by HP, who may have their own issues, but are likely to be a lot better than a no named brand if the item fails within the year. I generally have had good experiences with HP.Movies on the mini SD card that I have put on the tablet play well. I was impressed with the picture color and contrast.I'd say the only thing that is not that great is the battery life which seems to need recharging after 12-14 hours, my Asus ipad has standby charge for a few days like the ipad - so I think the battery is the only thing I can criticize. Also of note it does not have bluetooth or GPS sensors, the cameras are not that great in PQ but does have front and back cameras.Overall for the price seems to be a great buy.","rating":4},{"comment":"I liked it at first, but recently the touchscreen has had problems.

My initial impression, after just completing my review of the impressiveOlympus WS-821 Voice Recorderand even more impressiveOlympus DM-901 Voice Recorders, was that this unit would not do well at all.  Then I discovered two features that, depending on how you want to use it, makes this recorder far more valuable than the other two.The two features are:- This recorder can record, even at the highest quality setting, for a very, very long time.  The listing claims 70 hours and in my test, it recorded nonstop for 64 hours.- The built in stereo microphone is pretty darn good.  It captures sound very well.  I tried a good quality external microphone and didn't hear any improvement.The listing calls it a \"spy\" microphone, implying you can leave it somewhere, capture audio surreptitiously, and retrieve it later.  It will do that and I found an even better use for it; as an always-on life monitor.The problem with those other little recorders is they only record for so long.  If you leave them on there's a good chance the battery will run down during the day.  If you are like me, you'll never be quick enough or perhaps won't remember to pull it out when something comes up that I want to record.With this recorder, I hit \"Record\" on Friday morning and dropped it into my pocket.  It recorded everything that happened including some clever remarks by my daughter, a five-hour business meeting, a couple phone numbers that were told to me, saying goodbye to my wife on Saturday at the airport as she left for a business trip, all the things she told me to do while she was away, more clever remarks from my daughter the next morning... you get the idea.  It's a hand's off memory that captures everything.  Conveniently, the captured audio is broken into settable segments; I picked 60-minute chunks.All I have to do is connect the recorder with the included (or any other standard) micro-USB cable and drag the files to my PC.  They are named by the recording time and day plus a sequential number.  The file creation date tells me when they were recorded.  From there it's easy to zero in on the things I want to recall.Also included in the package is an external mic with a long cord, and a telephone recorder adapter complete with patch cables.  The external mic is not included to provide better audio quality (it makes it somewhat worse).  It is there so you can hide the recorder out of the way, like under some sofa cushions and snake the mic to a somewhat more exposed spot.  The telephone recorder adapter is not a high value item, looking very much like theTelephone Recording Adapter for Digital Voice Recorder.  Still, it's nice to have it tossed in.What isn't included is any software to play, edit, or enhance the audio.  That's OK.  There is a program called audacity (easily found via Google) that is free and worth many times that.  I used it for many years and it can do wonders to enhance audio if needed.One final thought - This recorder includes my favorite DVR feature, the ability to set a \"record start time\" and \"end time\".  You do that, put the recorder on \"Hold\" and can depend on it capturing the segment  selected.  At least, that used to be my favorite feature.  With this recorder I don't bother with any of that.  All I do is hit record and put it on hold.  Unless the thing I want to record is several days away it will be certain to capture what I want along with other interesting stuff that I hadn't anticipated.Bottom line: If you are looking for a \"fancy\" recorder then perhaps consider the options I listed at the top of this review.  However, if you want something that can capture everything said in your presence at the press of a single button for several days running then this little recorder could easily fit the bill.","rating":5},{"comment":"Like most budget products, this recorder will meet the needs of some, but not all.  If you need a recorder for the short-term for a class or conference this is a good choice.  It's easy to use right out of the box (good thing, because the manual is awful) and is usb-rechargeable so you don't need to worry about batteries.  The audio quality is good enough for note-taking or recording lectures.  These are the positives.The negatives are an almost laughably bad interface and poor quality screen.  Also, supposedly, it connects with your computer, but I have a mac and it didn't, and the manual wasn't really helpful.  The overall quality of this recorder and the accessories that come with it are pretty cheap - I don't see it lasting for the long run.","rating":3},{"comment":"For the price of this digital voice recorder you get a lot. In addition to the digital voice recorder you will receive a micro USB cable for charging it and transferring files to it. I hate buying batteries so I was glad that it was rechargeable. You will receive a pair of ear buds that are very simple but have much better than expected sound quality. The ear buds actually have an antenna built in because the device has a FM stereo receiver in it. That's a nice little addition. It has a built-in microphone but it comes with an external microphone as well. The sound quality sounds about the same either way but the external microphone would give you more flexibility on how you use it if you wanted to keep it out of sight.It has a small LCD screen, volume buttons, forward and back buttons, stop, record, delete, menu, power and hold buttons. It's not the easiest to learn how to navigate the options on the LCD screen at first but it didn't take me too long to get the hang of it.It also comes with a phone cable, audio cable and a special adapter. This set up allows you to record phone conversations with ease. This could be used for so many things. You could secretly record someone if you wanted to. You could use it at your workplace to monitor and record phone conversations for later use or for quality assurance and training. The phone recording set up works great and is very simple. The quality of the audio is very good in my opinion.You can use it to take notes, record to-do lists, grocery lists and record lectures at school. It also doubles as a simple MP3 player. This is really just an added bonus. You load the music by connecting it to your computer just like any other MP3 player. It has 8 GB of memory which is way more than I would ever use when you are talking about audio. You could hold your entire music collection on this and still holds hundreds of hours of audio recordings.Is this the best digital voice recorder on the market? No. But some digital voice recorders sell for hundreds of dollars. Is this a very good digital voice recorder an extremely good value? Absolutely yes. Just think of it this way. For the price of the 8 GB of memory you get the whole package including FM stereo, digital voice recorder, call monitoring cables, external microphone and a pair of ear buds. I am quite pleased with it and I think it's a steal for the price.Sample provided for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"After testing this recorder, I am amazed at how helpful it is for recording important meetings, lectures and even taking voice notes. Before this unit, I used an app on my phone, yet now I like having a device just for this purpose.What I like about this recorder:+ Has high quality recording and the playback is crystal clear.+ Portable and fits into my briefcase or purse for easy travel.+ This is a very high quality recorder and much better than the previous ones I used in the past.Recorder provided by aLLerli for testing and reviewing purpose.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have not used many dedicated voice recorders - my only experience so far has been with a small Sony recorder. That one works really well, and I am overall very pleased with it. However, it costs twice as much as this aLLreli recorder and it doesn't come with as many functions\/accessories.The quality of audio recordings that this recorder provides is pretty mediocre. I would not recommend it for music recording, but for voice it gets the job done, especially in some of the higher recording rate settings.This recorder works as an mp3 player, but not a very good one. Still, it's nice to have this option available in a pinch. It can also be used as an emergency USB stick.I really like some of the accessories that come with this recorder. It provides you with an attachable microphone, a set of headphones, and a telephone recording attachment. I have not seen any other one of the recorders I've come across with the last one of these, nor do I know if it is sold separately anywhere. I also like the fact that this recorder has a rechargeable battery. You can use a small micro USB port to charge it.This is not the best built recorder, nor do the accessories feel all that great. It's a fairly cheaply built device, and I am not certain how much mileage you will get out of it. I've used it for a few weeks, and so far it has worked all right, but it's too early to tell if that will hold in the long haul.If you do need some of the specialized features that this recorder offers, yet don't care about the professional or even good quality sound, then this recorder might be a good choice. Especially if you don't envision yourself using a recorder on a very regular basis. For very casual voice recording in a very simple and uncluttered environment I'd recommend that you just use the voice recording option on your smartphone. For more serious recording use you will be better off with a Sony or similar recorder.**** Product sample provided for review purposes. ****","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a very impressive (and incredibly small) multifunction device. You can use it to:-* Record meetings (between 4-48 days\/nights depending upon sound quality)* Store and play MP3 music files* 8Gb USB &#8220;memory&#8221; stick* Record telephone calls* Listen to (or record from) the built in FM radioWhat&#8217;s it like?---------------This is a tiny little device at 4 inches by 1.25 inches by 0.5 inch, and build quality is excellent with aluminium buttons and a small but readable LCD screen. The microphone produces crisp audit quality, and is omni-directional meaning it will pick up voices around a table (within 8-10 feet or so), and the battery life is excellent at an incredible 60 hours recording during testing before a battery warning.It comes with lots of bits including:-* Recorder itself with built in rechargeable battery* USB cable to connect\/charge from computer* Telephone cable and box for recording landline calls* Microphone* A single earphone* (admittedly poor) instruction manualWhat&#8217;s Great about it?------------------------Well, aside from the sleek design, 2.5 Days and nights battery life and huge memory (depending upon audio quality settings it will record between 4 and a massive 48 days audio) it also makes tea!Well OK, not quite.It will however act as an 8Gb USB stick, and will act as an MP3 player (it comes with 2 songs installed to prove it). At the (admittedly crystal) 192 kbps top quality sound, it will store 97 hours of sound, and can even record directly from the built in FM radio.It&#8217; remarkably configurable, and you can change almost anything about it. This includes the language (English, Chinese, French, German and Russian), and recording quality which ranges from a basic 32 to crystal clear 192 kbps. Amazingly, you can even set a password to protect your recording.What&#8217;s Not so Good?-----------------------Well, given the quality and range of uses, it seems a bit mean to knock off a star, but the instruction guide was terrible. Aside from the poor translation, the text is tiny. Luckily enough I managed to work out most features by playing around with it. Only other criticism is I&#8217;d have preferred to have the option to re-wind 15 seconds and to replay during recording. Other than that it&#8217;s great.In Conclusion.--------------Gene Hackman in the rather obscure cult film &#8220;The Conversation&#8221; (about eavesdroppers) would be impressed by this device. Bit scary that it includes a device to record phone conversations, but if you need it &#8211; this is the device for you.Highly Recommended.Disclosure: I was kindly provided this product from the manufacturer to provide an independent and unbiased review.","rating":5},{"comment":"Other reviewers have highlighted some of the best (and worst features) so I will  attempt to not repeat them. I will say that while this has some quirks, I do not agree with another that it's a piece of garbage. When I received mine as a review sample it took some time to become proficient with using it. The instructions were clear enough (although I do wish the print were larger), but there is a learning curve.Some functions, such as accessing the telephone mode, require you to long press buttons when you are booting the device up. I subtracted a star for that because other hand held recorders I have used are much simpler and intuitive to operate.However, this has a wealth of features and includes all of the necessary cables to use them. I especially like how easy it is to navigate around the file system. In fact, while the basic controls are somewhat obtuse, that feature is one of the best I have used on any competing device.One other feature that I absolutely love is this can be used as a thinb drive in a pinch. I am forever wiching I had a thumb drive when fellow musicians want to share a practice session or songs I need to work on. This solves that problem because I carry mine on my drumstick bag. I have also used it to capture parts of practice sessions, so it has become quite useful to me - and that is why I gave it a solid four stars. It may have a few quirks, but I find myselof using it a lot and see it as a valuable tool.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a very feature packed recorder. I use it mainly for recording meetings at work and for archiving voicemails that I don't want to delete. It works great for recording meetings, it's able to pick up the faintest voices, and the built in speaker makes it nice to replay the meeting at a later time.the one issue that I had with it was with recording my voicemails. I tried using the included Aux in headphone cable and plugging that into my cellphone and connecting headphones to the headphone jack but the sound was way to quiet and had a large amount of static. I am going to investigate some more.Overall I think this is a great little recorder feature packed and a lot of accessories to connect to almost any type of modern communication device.* Disclosure: I was sent a free product samples for review purposes.

For full disclosure, I wills state that Transcend took several days to get back to me at first, but I take this as being due to a holiday weekend, which I take as an indication they are keeping their customer service dept domestic, which is very good.  After they got back to me, the communication was quick and they were very fast to offer a full replacement, but I had already gone that same route through the Amazon return service.When the new one arrived, I popped it in the slot on my Macbook Air, and it mounted immediately.  The transfer rates are excellent for an SD card.  The sizing fits the slot exactly they state - there is a thin plastic &#34;lip&#34; that keeps it from going in too far, but otherwise, it is flush with the body of the computer.  It's flush enough that you need fingernails or a tool to get it started when you want to remove it - but that's a good thing: no chance of it coming out accidentally.I can't speak for long-term durability yet, but will try to remember to come back and update you.  This product is advertised as doubling your hard drive space.  Yes and no... and also even more than that.  My MBA has a 128GB SSD (as do most).  This adds 128GB.  So yes, it doubles your drive capacity.  But, rather than a simple double up, it is both less and more than that.It acts as a D: drive - a second and separate drive.  Not all apps are friendly to that, so you'd be wise to take a little care what you put on it.  So far, my iTunes has no trouble - which is my biggest memory hog, and I only keep a small portion of my music on my computer.But... it also MORE than doubles your drive capacity in a way because zero space is taken up with your operating system or required applications.  So it is a clean 128GB of storage space, instead of the &#60;120 you get on your SSD after installing an OS and some applications.  My MBA has less than 100GB remaining after I load just the OS and the programs I absolutely need.  So really, this doubles me up AND give me 28+GB in addition.  Not too shabby.Thanks to Ms. Wong at Transcend and to Amazon for pleasant customer service experiences as well.","rating":4},{"comment":"It took about three weeks to receive my jet drive 130 from purchase date.

My iTunes library is about 40 GB. it took about 10 to 15 minutes. i have not tested the speeds but it moves quick enough for me.

Slide this product in and have instant expansion.  Move your content here and double click to open it and your off and running.  Truly that simple.  I have a mid 2011 Macbook Air so it has the slower SD card slot according to the Transcend website.  I don't notice it is slow, and neither does the HD video.  I fully enjoy this upgrade.  The face of the drive sits flush against the body of the Macbook with just a thin lip exposed so you have an edge to grab with your finger nails to take it out if you want to use the slot to read camera cards or anything else.  I purchased a usb stick that reads SD Cards so I want have to eject my card.  I comes format with the FAT file system, but since it is meant to stay in the macbook and it's form factor is such that it probably will not fit anywhere else, I reformatted mine with the OSX file system; just in case that improves performance in any way...

In an era where 500 GB is the norm and even 1 TB is common, a 256 GB drive is small.When I bought my 15 inch Mac Book Pro with Retina Display, I rationalized that with iCloud and other cloud storage options the loss of half of my hard drive would be find compensation in the increased speed and reliability of a SSD. To some extent those assumptions were correct. Nonetheless I often found myself managing drive utilization trying to keep at least 10% of the total storage space open.Transcend provides a solution. For slightly less than $80 and a Jet Drive Lite 350 I have increased my drive space by fifty percent. The Transcend Jet Drive Lite is essentially a High Capacity SD card which installs into one of the existing SD ports on MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. &#8232;&#8232;There are four different model cards, and you should carefully consider the chart before ordering. Each card is tailored for specific machines and is designed to be inserted into the port and lie more of less flush against the case, not sticking out like a normal SD card. The normal card can be spring ejected. This is not so with the Jet Drive Lite. It is very difficult to remove, and since it is in effect a secondary SSD that permanency is a virtue. I have inadvertently \"ejected\" the card fin the Finder only to discover it simply disconnects. The simplest recovery mode is to log out and then log back in and the drive is automatically recognized.The card comes in a box, with warranty information, and nothing else. The limited lifetime warranty, if you can read it without an electron microscope, is quite good. You should make sure however that your card data on it is being backed up regularly. I use Time Capsule and the setting on  installation excluded the Jet Drive Lite. I think the reason for this is that the drive  appears to your Mac to be no more than a temporary SD card and SD cards are not backed up unless you change your settings.So having a card and an open port I pressed it in. Since the card doesn't eject, there is no \"click\" associated with my effort. However an icon appeared immediately on my desktop, and I knew my MBP was reading the drive.My first thought was that I would move all my photos and videos to the Transcend Jet Drive Lite 350. Immediately I received a message- \"The destination disk is not properly formatted.\"Indeed it was not, and that is peculiar. We are looking at a product designed exclusively for newer Apple laptops, and the card was FAT formatted. It takes less than a minute to reformat the card to Mac OS Extended (Journaled)Once the disk was reformatted I moved my entire Aperture Library to the Jet Drive Lite . I am a lawyer, not a technician, but it seemed to me that the transfer speed was quite fast, at least as fast as my USB 3.0 flash drive and possibly as fast as a Thunderbolt device.All in all, the Transcend Jet Drive Lite meets a lot of my needs. The price and the huge capacity should justify you giving it a try.","rating":5},{"comment":"First time I plugged it in, it wouldn't let me reformat. Pulled it out and reseated it a couple times and was finally working right. Then I try to copy things to it and it messes up in the middle of the transfer.

I'm currently in the process of trying to get a replacement.","rating":1},{"comment":"I had (and backed) the Nifty MiniDrive. It was flaky at best, cheaply made, and easily came apart.This JetDrive is anything but that. Rock solid build, fits snuggly, and I'm getting great speeds considering it's an SD card. The list max speed rates are pretty spot on. Formatted as OS Extended I'm getting about 30-40mb\/s write and 85-90mb\/s read, which is plenty fast for what I'm using it for: offloading media so I have more room for more things on my internal SSD.

Professional reviewers did and will review it much better than me. All I can say is that for such a small camera, and from a still-photo perspective, there is almost nothing you cannot adjust. The photo quality is amazing even at high ISO. The viewfinder and tilting screen are more than rare in such cameras. My only take, and it is not worth taking out a star, is the size. I have a Canon PowerShot S120 and it is \"pocketable.\" I am a big guy, and I can still cannot fit it in my pocket. It is still small enough though and truly worth buying.","rating":5},{"comment":"You can imagine camera manufacturers trying their best to squeeze every possible feature into a compact camera body while still keeping it priced reasonably. In my opinion, Sony has innovated the most and made the third iteration of the RX100 the best of the three, as well as when compared to the competition.I have both the original RX100 and the RX100M3. I bought the first model right away when it came out a couple of years ago. It is still an excellent prosumer camera in 2014 with a good, basic feature set.I did not buy the RX100M2 because I felt it did not have enough additional useful features to justify the added cost. Visually, the protruding multi-function hot-shoe also made the camera less aesthetically pleasing.I bought the RX100M3 because of the following reasons:1. The excellent Zeiss lens offering a wider wide angle (24mm) and much larger aperture (f\/1.8 to 2.8) while trading off a smaller zoom range (24 to 70mm vs. 28 to 100mm), when compared to the original RX100. I use the wide end of a zoom lens much more often, and frequently in low light, so this lens is more suitable and useful for me than the one on the original RX100. For shooting in the bright outdoors, the M3 has a built-in 3-stop neutral density filter that helps to keep the aperture from stopping down for a pleasing blurred background effect.2. The built-in, pop-up Electronic ViewFinder (EVF) which allows picture-taking the traditional way (up against the eye\/body for more steadiness), is useful, unobtrusive, and more convenient than an external one. It is also a necessity when the shooting environment is the sunny and bright outdoors, where the LCD screen cannot be seen clearly. An external EVF is available for the RX100M2, but beside additional bulk, it costs $450 extra. The built-in EVF is great not just for composing a shot but also for checking exposure after a shot (or a video) is taken. You can't appreciate this feature enough until you find how frustrating it is trying to compose\/check a shot under a bright sun, looking at a dim and washed out LCD screen.3. An even more versatile tilt screen. The RX100M3 now allows you to take pictures from a low position, above the crowd, and of yourself. Without the protruding hot-shoe of the RX100M2, it was then possible to design the M3 screen to tilt up 180 degrees for taking selfies (self-portraits). You may be surprised how much you will use this feature now that it is possible. No need to risk asking strangers to take pictures for you anymore when you want to be included in a travel scene.4. Last but not least, the RX100M3 is a vastly better video shooter compared to the two previous models. The new BIONZ X image processor permits full-sensor readout and XAVC S compression (requires SDXC memory card class 10) for excellent quality video comparable to the Sony RX10 bridge\/superzoom camera. Video frame rates now include 24p, 30p, 60p, and 120p (@720p).The RX100 series cameras utilize a 1-inch image sensor in a compact body while most point-and-shoot cameras use 1\/2.3 inch sensors. A larger sensor can gather more light so its image quality tends to be better than a small sensor. But compared to 1\/2.3 inch sensor cameras, a 1-inch sensor camera's lens size needs to be physically bigger and its zoom range much smaller, given a limited camera size. With these constraints, I deem it a wonder that Sony can come up with the RX100 series camera with so many features while keeping it very compact. Sony also makes cameras in the Compact System Camera (CSC) category that feature an even larger sensor (APS-C) and interchangeable lens capability, but they are not \"pocketable\" and an equivalent 24-70mm Zeiss lens costs $1,200 alone.While I have other cameras, the Sony RX100M3 IS the one that I carry with me all of the time. I suggest using Sony's well-designed LCJ-RXF jacket (ever-ready) case to carry around your RX100M3. It allows the camera to be well protected until the moment you want to use it.","rating":5},{"comment":"I waited patiently for 2 months to receive what is now the third version of the RX100.  I read everything about it that I could ahead of time and recognize that this is a camera enthusiasts dream.  All of the other reviews focus on the positives of the camera so no need to repeat that except to say that the build quality is excellent, the software nearly perfect and the image quality just stellar for its size.  It's a technological marvel.But, after using the camera for just a brief time, I realized that I just cannot live with the immensely small (2.9x) zoom.  It's even less than the last version.  As good as this camera is and as spectacular as the image quality ends up being, the camera is just not practical for me without more optical zoom.  It barely zooms which essentially means you have to be right up on your subject which, for me, means missing out on many shots.I get that Sony made tradeoffs to get such stellar picture quality in such a form factor and my hats off to them for their remarkable advances.  But, for me, I realized after using the camera briefly that I'd happily trade slightly less quality for much longer range.  Most compact cameras nowadays have outstanding picture quality at longer distances.I'm sure many will be extremely happy with this camera, and there's a lot to like about it, but it's just not for me.","rating":3},{"comment":"Expectation:The camera should be compact so it can go anywhere, focus quickly, focus accurately, and take sharp\/high quality photos that are rich in color. As an added bonus, it should take high quality video and do well in low light without a flash.With that expectation in mind, the following pros and cons were found while shooting extra fine jpeg images and AVCHD 60p 28M(PS) videos.Pros:1) Compact enough to go everywhere.2) Takes excellent photos in low light without a flash.3) Takes beautiful macro shots that are rich in detail.4) Focuses very quickly.5) The background can be forced out-of-focus to create a professional looking effect.6) Takes high quality video at 1080p.7) Easily takes panoramic shots.8) Zooming in and out is nearly silent.9) The screen flips up for self-portraits.10) The \"Fn\" button brings up a highly customizable quick menu.11) Several buttons including the control ring can be customized.Cons:1) The \"Wide\" \"Focus Area\" setting frequently results in the image, especially the center, being out-of-focus. Half pressing the shutter button will correct the issue... sometimes.2) \"Intelligent Auto\" shooting mode is not a dependable mode to leave the camera in.a. It ALWAYS uses the \"Wide\" \"Focus Area\" in this mode (see con #1).b. Scene recognition frequently selects the wrong scene. Taking an image of a car passing at 25 miles per hour results in a blurred streak.3) When the \"Center\" \"Focus Area\" setting is selected, images still lack sharpness when compared to a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 from 2009.4) Colors are dull, especially when compared to images taken by a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS3 from 2009.5) Auto white balance (AWB) sometimes produces shots that are too warm.a. If two shots are taken back-to-back sometimes one will be warm and the other accurate.6) In a space the size of a living room, using a flash at distance frequently results in overexposure.7) When shooting handheld, it's difficult to maintain the proper grip and use the control ring due to the size of the camera and lack of an actual grip.8) The screen is cluttered with an excessive amount of icons that cannot be individually shown\/hidden. Given that individual icon control is unavailable, the following seem like unnecessary icons for these reasons:a. Infrequently changes: image ratio, number of megapixels, video formatb. Simply unneeded: SteadyShotSummary:There are several pros when it comes to the RX100 III but they seem to center around physical camera interaction and less frequent uses such as, low light and video. When it comes to daylight photos, which is a very frequent camera use, the bottom line is that pictures are not sharp enough or rich enough in color. Furthermore, you need to be ready to take a picture at a moment's notice and that requires a high quality and dependable automatic shooting mode that is lacking in this camera.","rating":2},{"comment":"Had the original 100, and this is a step up in all ways except zoom length.  As with my first one... Extraordinarily sharp, clear, detailed and saturated photos, faster shot to shot and better low light performance.  Little heavier, little thicker, very well made.  I would easily have given up the EVF for a touchscreen... I suspect Sony knows that by now, and i have no doubt it sill be on the next model.  Cons: The flash is now a manually actuated pop up, even when forced &#34;on&#34; in the menu, which seems dumb... and not well thought out, especially since the menu hasn't changed.  Why have a forced flash menu option when you have to manually pop it up?  Form factor still REQUIRES the addition of the rubber grip, or you WILL drop it.  How Sony got that one wrong is a true mystery.  That being said, yes... I ditched my Nikon D7000 and lenses and could not be more happy, not to be lugging it all around.  Under almost every circumstance, you cannot tell the difference between the DSLR shots and the Sony.  I have been a photographer for 40 years, and this is the first real game changer that made me ditch all the gear... Its just not necessary any more.  I fully understand that this is a subjective review, not technical.  If you need that, there are many technical online reviews that come to the same conclusion.  You will not be disappointed.","rating":5},{"comment":"Wonderful Tiny camera.  The perfect go every where camera when you just don't have room for your DLSR, or I suppose for some a replacement for a DLSR.  Although not perfect by a long ways, limited focal length range, no hot shoe, feeble flash, it does have a lot going for it.  Two gripes:  $800 camera, and no neck strap??  Come Sony, that's just silly.  The supplied charger is also an oversight.  The ACCTRBX is the charger that should have been supplied.  The one that comes with the camera needs a cord to an outlet or a USB.  The ACCTRBX can also plug into the wall with no cord as an option, eliminating one more thing to pack for a trip.  Just figure on adding the ACTRBX and LCJ-RXF Sony case and you will have a stunning, but $1,000 point and shoot camera, that makes better images than just about anything short of a FX DLSR.  I am comparing the images to my Nikon D800, not a huge difference, and the Sony is going to get more use.","rating":5},{"comment":"As a big Sony fan and owner of the RX100M2, I was happy to see some features I wanted incorporated into the M3 which was the tipping point to me forking out my dough and buying this. Alas, I am disappointed.This camera does take excellent pictures and the F2.8 does well in low light situation when zoom all the way out. The ability to take 3:2 is new and the camera seems to process the picture lot faster. There are now new options for video recording format. Battery wise, it's near identical and the difference is non meaningful.  Size and weight between the M2 and M3, it's near identical. Both use the same battery and battery charger.The M3 EVF feature was one I was really looking forward to, but it's a big disappointment. Previously with my M2, I had an external EVF hooked up to it which works well but made the camera harder to carry. When you slide up the EVF the camera will automatically turn on, and when your done, you push it down and the camera lens retract and turn off. Sounds good? Not really. What Sony did not mention is that when using the EVF, not only do you have to pop it up, but you have to pull the EVF towards you to adjust the diopter EVERYTIME, else it will be out of focus. Can you imagine how inconvenience this will be? Sony should have put a small diopter dial. The other problem is that the EVF is so small it is very hard to make out any of the letters\/numbers. In other words, I find the EVF practically useless..Another thing I came to dislike is the zoom. Initially I thought I would be okay with the 24mm-70mm but now I wonder why Sony didn't keep the M2's 28mm to 105mm and make it an F2.8.I'm still contemplating on keeping this camera and not sure. If you have a RX100 I would suggest the M3 is a worthy upgrade. But from M2 to M3 I'm not so sure..","rating":3},{"comment":"I'll start off with the good.  I owned the Fuji x100s for about a year before I sold it.  Not becuase I didn't like it, because I did, but because it was simply too big to fit in my pocket and its weird in camera rendering to skin tones when the iso increased.  I also still own a Nikon D800 and D600 but needed something for every day photo's with family and just for fun.  This camera on paper is perfect.  Size, large aperture, 24-70mm equivalent, image stabalized AND has a revolutionary built in EVF.  When it arrived the first thing I noticed was how compact it really is.  It is a tiny camera even if the previous generations are small as well.  It seems very solid (except the popout flash which feels like I'm going to break it every time I push it back in) for being so small but at the same time there is so much packed into a tiny space I'm constantly worried I'm going to break something.  I guess that's what I get when I go from 2 full frame DSLR's to a pocket cam for travel.  Nonetheless this is a technological marvel.  My favorite feature, that incredible rotating LCD.  Awesome.  I shoot weddings with pro-level DSLR's and I can't tell you how much I appreciate the rotating LCD!  The fact I can flip it around 180 degress to take a picture with my wife and then rotate it to 45 degrees down to shoot over my head is so useful I can't recommend it enough.  We've taken more pics together since getting this camera than in the past year simply because it is easy to do.  The viewfinder is very neat but to be honest I haven't found a situation where I've wanted to use it yet (that doesn't mean that I won't but I haven't as of yet).  The image quality, in terms of focus and clarity, is excellent.  The low light results have been reasonably good up to about 1600 iso and I allow it to go up to 3200 iso sometimes if I really need a shot.  This is impressive for a camera with a sensor this small.  Now I have to mention my number one issue with this camera and the reason it gets a 4 instead of a 5 from me.....Auto White Balance.  I don't know why but every sony camera I've ever used has substantially cooler white balance than any other brand I've used.  This comes across as a slightly blue and green tint in photos.  Maybe the average consumer won't notice but I look at images all the time when I edit for weddings and these colors are off.  I know I can set multiple manual white balances with this camera but my purpose in getting this was to have a small camera for everyday use that I can shoot JPEG's with in aperture priority and have no editing to do in post.  The Auto White Balancing is, in my opinion, terrible.  My old fuji rendered significantly more accurate colors straight out of camera.  I plan to play around with the camera to see if I can globally adjust the auto white balance to a level I'm comfortable with.  If sony reads these I would encourage them to examine their AWB outputs vs the competition and release a firmware update that at least offers a second \"auto\" setting to warm up the tones across the board.  I hate to harp so much on this as the camera itself is excellent.  Hopefully I can find a way to make it work as I don't want to return the camera.  If you have a lot of experience with these cameras and know of a solution for me, I am open to input from the community as well!  The only other con to this camera is the On\/Off button.  I don't know why they insisted on this being a button.  A switch would have made this a non-issue.  I accidentally turn this thing on frequently while sliding it into my pocket.  This is a scary thing to do as the lens shoots out as soon as the power goes on.  When this happens you are greeted with the unpleasant sound of the motor griding to push the lens out through your pocket.  I have to be very careful when holding the camera as you barely have to press the button to activate the power.In conclusion, fantastic small camera with some small issues.  Definitely the best pocket camera out there.  If you prefer cool tones in your images this is a no brainer.  If you prefer more realistic tones, I'll post an update if I find a way to get this thing to warm up.UPDATE: So if you don't mind shooting in the Auto modes then there is a pretty good solution.  If you click down on the rear dial it brings up a simple settings menu.  On that menu is a temperature adjustment that lets you warm up the image to your liking.  The downside is that it resets everytime you turn the camer off.  Also, that simple menu is only available under the auto modes and does not activate under the A,S or M modes.  For me, this is a good enough answer as my usage of this camera is primarily in auto mode (if I want a highly technical photo I'll probably use my D800).  No doubt this camera can do great things and has very versatile raw files but I have no desire to edit these files and it is meant to be a quick fix when I want a picture:)  I'm still not giving it 5 stars because the power button is way to easy to activate and that annoys me to no end.  Despite my feelings about the AWB and power button, this is the absolute best pocketable camera on the market by a landslide.  Nothing on the market comes close to the image quality that can still fit in your pocket.  It will not disapoint in that regard.So all said, this camera is awesome (don't sweat the small stuff).  Sony has leapfrogged the competition and I don't see any of the competitors beating this camera unless the Fuji X30 gets a 1\" sensor as well at Photokina this year and is able to maintain the size and speed of the rx100 iii.  I honestly doubt that will happen though.  Sony's improvements have been pretty awesome and I can't wait to see what they do when they have mastered their lens element fusing technique used in the rx100 iii.  Perhaps an even faster lens in the same size or maybe even an APSC sensor in a pocketable body!  Wouldn't that be awesome!  If you want a portable camera that won't let you down, this is the only game in town right now.","rating":4},{"comment":"Recently I went on a week-long college tour with my daughter. The RX100M3 was the perfect camera to bring along.I didn't even consider taking my D800. Even without its grip and with a 50mm prime, it was too big, too heavy, and too 'there' all the time. I adore the D800, but this was an on-your-feet, strolling in and out of buildings, across quads, and past athletic fields for hours at a time kind of day.So I bought the RX100M3. Fits right in my pants pocket. Not jeans, but khakis. I'd forget it was there, until I wanted a shot. Then I'd pull it out, get the shot, and tuck it away again.Plenty of battery life, so I had enough juice for multiple college visits in one day. Including the 'scene setter' shots of the towns they were located in.At the end of the day, the image quality was excellent. Just plain excellent. It handled a variety of mixed-lighting shots, landscapes, lecture halls, dorm rooms, architecture, and interiors.My D800 would probably have done better. But for a level playing field I would have had to bring the 24-70mm...which would have excelled. But then? The trips would have been more about the camera than the schools....and that was not what I wanted.Very happy with this little travel companion.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have owned this camera for a week or so, and find that the pictures I have taken come out in sharp focus, with excellent metering. I think the camera works very well as an advanced, big sensor and fast lens point and shoot.A few things to watch out for... the battery door is somewhat flimsy and will not tolerate too much rough handling. Amazing how every single camera manufacturer competes to build the thinnest door possible. The rotary dial controlling most functions appears to be OK, but is probably built to last around 3 years of heavy use and no more. The viewfinder is a great touch but here again, even though it is well built, it appears quite delicate and unlikely to tolerate rough handling. The back screen does not click back into place when you're done tilting it. I would have liked to see it click back and not just depend on friction to hold it in place. Not sure if frequent use will make the whole thing loose.Bottom line, great and expensive camera, you gotta treat it gently.","rating":4},{"comment":"I loved the first RX100 until, the night of my daughter's birth, it decided not to open the camera lens, had some motor malfunction, and kept saying 'Turn power off then on&#34;.  Luckily this was right before the new RX100iii was out.  So I ordered it.Today I got the RX100iii from Amazon.  Took about, oh, 20 photos with it (the RAW format versions didn't work with Apple's Aperture, fyi), and tonight thought I'd get an awesome pic of my daughter.  Grabbed the camera and guess what.&#34;Turn power off then on&#34; and the exact same lens cap opener issue staring me right in the face.And it is brand new - one of the first batch sold.Thank God it's Amazon and I can send it back.","rating":1},{"comment":"I bought the RX100 Mark I as my first &#34;real&#34; camera when it came out, and I was already blown away.

I'm sure I could think of some very minor annoyances to mention, but to be honest this revision literally has everything I could ask for and more.It also *looks* beautiful, which is more than can be said for some other cameras competing on size.","rating":5},{"comment":"5 stars because this small camera is the best in its class (DP Review gives it their coveted Gold Award). This camera will NOT replace a high quality DSLR camera, but then again, you cannot put a high quality DSLR in your pocket.  The lens is fast for this class of camera, and the EVF makes the camera eminently useable ... composing your photo holding a compact camera at arms-length to see the rear LCD screen in distracting sunlight glare gets old really fast.  This Sony has a hidden attraction: putting the camera into Manual mode allows you to create a new exposure mode: a &#34;Shutter-Aperture-Priority&#34; mode a-la-Pentax, which can come in handy - even my Canon DSLR can't to THAT.  If you like to hike with your compact camera, consider taking along a monopod that can double as a hiking stick. The increased stability provided with the monopod can make your pix just a tad more crisp.  This camera does not have a touch-sensitive screen but I don't really need that. Verdict: Quality photographs from a &#34;pocketable&#34;, well-built camera. Well done Sony.","rating":5},{"comment":"HARDWAREYou'll still get better performance from a top-of-the-line mirrorless camera or DSLR, but those aren't nearly as portable, and they're certainly not small enough to carry in your pocket. The RX100 is plenty capable, but its greatest strength is its size. While heavier than many other point-and-shoots, it's not much larger. Its powerful 24-70mm f\/1.8-2.8 Vario-Sonnar T* zoom lens does make it quite a bit thicker than your run-of-the-mill compact, but assuming you can deal with a moderate bulge, it can fit in a pants pocket.You'll more likely be dangling the RX100 III from your wrist, using the included band, or from a third-party neck strap (the requisite adapters are in the box). Despite its small size, however, the camera offers all of the necessary buttons and dials, including a dedicated mode dial, a video record button, a scroll wheel (for adjusting aperture and\/or shutter speed) and a button for accessing the integrated WiFi mode, which lets you transmit images from the camera directly to a smartphone or a tablet.This time around, the greatest engineering feat is the pop-up electronic viewfinder. It's located at the far-left corner, and extends up about one inch when in use. The clever design includes a slide-out magnifier, complete with a diopter adjustment dial. The camera powers on as soon as you extend the EVF using the release switch on the left side of the housing, though it also turns off when you push it back down. Like most other EVFs, there's a proximity sensor that activates the finder and disables the LCD when you raise it to your eye. Of course, grazing the viewfinder with a finger or other appendage has the same effect, but you can simply push it back into the housing to eliminate the issue.Because the EVF takes up quite a bit of space within the housing, Sony had to move the pop-up flash a bit to the right. It's now centered just above the lens, though it extends far enough to reach beyond the zoom, even at the widest focal length. Given that the flash has now taken over the real estate previously allocated to the full-size hot shoe, that component is a casualty of the RX100's redesign, though (as mentioned earlier) with the exception of perhaps a few hardcore shooters, it likely won't be missed.USER INTERFACEFor a spell, Sony began including touchscreens with its mirrorless cameras, such as the NEX-5N, but newer models, including the Alpha 6000 and flagship A7s don't offer that feature. All three RX100 models also lack touch functionality, including this year's iteration, which may be a disappointment to some. On the other hand, no touchscreen means Sony needed to include a range of dedicated controls and dials, which ultimately work to improve the experience. The trade-off, of course, is that you can't tap to focus, which many shooters have come to count on when capturing video.The user interface hasn't changed much since the original RX100. The menu layout is more or less identical, though there have been some slight cosmetic tweaks. The quick-access menu has been refined -- it's a bit more straightforward to use now -- but indicators and the camera's general workflow are consistent with past models. Like with the RX100 II, you can transfer images over WiFi using Sony's PlayMemories Mobile app for smartphones and tablets, but unlike competing products, you can't control the camera remotely.PERFORMANCE AND BATTERY LIFEThe first model in this series was lauded for its incredibly fast focusing, and the RX100 III performs just as you'd expect. It focuses very quickly, and it's accurate nearly all of the time. Focus hunting is perceptible, particularly with dim subjects when you're not using the AF-assist light, but if you miss a shot due to speed, the camera probably won't be to blame. Granted, it's not the fastest gun in the West, but it's definitely one of the best in its class. As with any compact camera with a power zoom lens, it takes a second or two to get the camera powered on and ready to capture its first shot. If you're anticipating an upcoming capture, it's best to leave the RX100 powered on -- once the camera's standing by, shutter lag is barely noticeable.As for battery life, I took the RX100 on vacation and managed to get through three days of exploring without charging up. On average, I probably used the camera for a few hours each day, so if you tend to capture hundreds of shots and dozens of video clips during each day of touring, you'll need to charge up overnight. During that period, I was able to snap more than 500 stills and 13 minutes of 1080p\/60 video, which was captured with the high-bit rate (and processor-intensive) XAVC S codec.IMAGE QUALITYSince we're already on the topic of video, I'll start with some analysis there. The XAVC S codec available with Sony's latest cameras is a significant step up from AVCHD. Video looks great on the camera, of course, but when evaluating footage on a laptop, it's hard to believe this level of quality came from a camera you can slip in your pocket. The new f\/1.8-2.8 lens also deserves some of the credit, I'm sure, but the improvement is clear. The one con is that you'll need to use a file converter to edit and output your footage using a computer. I used Pavtube ($35), which worked very well.Unfortunately, once you convert footage and upload it to the web (with further compression), you lose a lot of that captured detail. The resulting clips, as you'll see in the footage reel above, look better than what you'd shoot with some other compact cameras, but unless you're maintaining that high 50 Mbps bit rate, you'll notice some degradation for sure. In the reel above, exposure was spot-on, and the RX100's integrated optical image stabilization helped keep things steady, even as I moved around.WRAP-UPWhen Sony launched its first RX100 back in 2012, we were very impressed. The camera offered tremendous functionality in a pocketable package. Then, when the RX100 II came around last year, Sony added WiFi along with a full-size hot shoe (which can accommodate high-end audio gear, among other accessories), besting the original model. This year's iteration is by far the most capable yet, with a superior lens, XAVC S encoding and a unique pop-up EVF. At $800, it's a significant investment, particularly within the point-and-shoot category, but if you need a ton of power in your pocket and you don't mind paying for it, you can't do any better than this.","rating":5},{"comment":"This camera is simply the most amazing little camera every made. I shoot with a Fujifilm X-T1 and a 23mm, 10-24mm, 35mm and 55-200mm. That's a lot to carry around. I've been reading the reviews of this camera, and a few of my friends have them. I finally decided to join the party and I am not disappointed. This camera takes amazing photos. Just amazing. The F1.8 aperture, the electronic view finder, the articulating LCD, and so on really make it stand out.Sony has really produced a marvel of technology here. So happy with this purchase.","rating":5},{"comment":"I'm now on my third DSC-RX 100 version: the Mk III. I also own a Canon 5D Mk III and a Leica M9, but the great truism is that your photo is only as good as the camera you happen to have with you. Hence a lot of photos today are taken using smartphones and every one of them is better than the photo you would never have taken if you didn't have a camera in hand!The RX 100 is arguably the best compact camera on the market, on balance. And the Mk III outshines its predecessors in the following ways:* The effective image quality is improved. It uses exactly the same sensor as the Mk II but it has a stop or more advantage as you zoom in and that simply means that a photo that would have been captured at, say, 400 ISO is now captured at 200 ISO. (The lower the ISO the less noise). Richard from Boston, respectfully: all three versions have the same F1.8 lens at the widest focal length. It is as you zoom that the maximum F stop decreases: from F4.9 in the prior versions at 100mm (35mm equivalent) focal length, to F2.8 in the current version but at a maximum focal length of only 70mm.* The zoom range is reduced but extended at the wide angle end: 24mm-70mm (35mm equivalent) from 28mm-100mm in the prior versions. This is a big plus for me but maybe less so for others. I used to use Panasonic\/Leica LX compacts (same friggin' camera but you pay at least 2X for the Leica label and Leica's product design - the plastic casing - is more than 2x better than Panasonic's) that had a 24mm-90mm (F1.4-F2.8) lens and I really missed the 24mm widest angle when I moved to Sony. So, why did it take so long for Sony to catch up with Panasonic? Fact is, Sony's sensor is much, much bigger than Panasonic's. This translates to superior performance, but makes it much harder to make bright zoom lenses for such a compact camera. (Consider how large lenses are on a DSLR.)* The EVF is fantastic. I've been using SLRs for 50 years, literally, and the greatest advantage to a viewfinder in my opinion is that it anchors the camera to your face and you end up with a more stable camera and a lower required shutter speed which translates into a lower ISO and better image quality.  This EVF is 'only' 1.44 megapixels, versus 2.44 in their higher end cameras, but both look absolutely 'real' (as if you were looking through an optical viewfinder for the most part with the larger pixel space simply 'looking' larger through the view finder.)Other advantages include a better menu structure and a dedicated flash on button - which is a big deal from my POV. Also a rear screen that can flip up completely for selfies.Any way you look at it, the Sony RX-100 is a fantastic camera in any version, but the Mk III is the most impressive.Bravo, Sony!PS: all there versions have a pivoting flash that allows one to bounce the flash off a ceiling. The results are so much better than direct flash. It really delivers vastly superior flash photos assuming you have fairly light and low ceilings. (Only really works in landscape orientation where the flash pivots up. The Mk III pivot also goes much further (beyond straight up), and the only downside of the whole line is the flash time which is on the slow side.","rating":5},{"comment":"Great camera. I have both the original and the new one. Viewfinder is very good quality but LCD is so good I only need it 10 to 15 percent of the time. Smaller zoom range has not been an issue for my applications. My only complaint is not as much easy focus control. You can get there but it is a bit of work.","rating":5},{"comment":"I bought this camera because of its faster lens (f\/1.8 to f2.8), which means, to me,  more light entering onto the cameras sensor which, in turn, means to me slightly better images than previous models. Which translate to a shallower depth of field available.  And that's exactly what I like and want in this model, and precisely why I bought it, even though I also have the previous M2 model.  One thing I want to note here before I go on.  The Aperture seems to move quite fast from 1.8 to 2.8 thru the smaller zoom range.  In that, a case could be made that this lens is more of a steady 2.8 thru out the zoom range.So then what exactly did I get with this upgrade from my M2 to my new M3?  Well, you've got the newer Bionz X processer.  The new 180 degree LCD (for Selfies if you are so inclined).  The pop-up EVF (which is an innovation in and of itself, and a help with image stabilization when pressed against my face).  Zebra pattern and focus peaking which is available on my RX10 and now the M3.I feel the 24mm-70mm lens (though not the same reach as my previous M2 model - 28-100mm) is a good walk-around lens. And since I have been using this same zoom range for a long time on my DSLRs, I feel very comfortable with this zoom range in a very capable and now compact camera.  When I use this for portraits at the long end of 70mm I expect to shoot mostly 1\/2 to 3\/4 body shots to full body shots.  As opposed to the previous models zoom range of 28-100mm where I used it up to head and shoulder shots at the long end.This camera has the same  Bionz X processor that Sony has in their A7 line of cameras (one of which, the A7R, that I have).  That was another plus for me in buying this camera.  As far as image stabilization, it is important to compact cameras today and thus, to me.  And I find that holding the camera up to my face while using the EVF gives me the 'feel' of a more stabilized shot.  And my pictures look better to me.  This is important to me because now that I am in my 60's, try as I might, holding the M2 or my smartphone without an EVF - is not as steady as I'd like it to be or as I remember it was when I was younger.  And I need image stabilization in lower light.  And this EVF on my new compact M3 seems to provide that for me.  The only 'unofficial' (perhaps non-technical) test I could do with this camera was to zoom it out to 70mm, and hold the shutter half-way to see how much 'lock' I had on the image.  Then I tried it with my M2.  My observation was that I did see an improved difference with the M3.There is a slight difference in camera size from the previous model (which I also have).  The thickness of this model is about 2mm more.  And the weight is about 8 to 9 grams more.  What this also means in terms of fitting a leather case to it is that my previous models Sony leather case will not fit this camera.  You're going to need the Sony LCJRXF\/B Premium Jacket Case (Black).  This new case will fit all previous models as well as this model.  Just as the Sony LCJRXC\/B Premium Jacket Case (Black) would only fit the M2 as well as the M1.  Some people think that the case for the M2 will also fit the M3.  It will not.  I have tried it.  I also recommend the custom camera grip by Richard Franiec (camera accessories by Richard Franiec).  This goes for about 35$ and is worth its weight in gold - to me.  It is far better than the Sony grip that I used on the M2 for 15$. Its made of metal (anodized aluminium) is sleek looking, feels good quality and solid, and gives you a good grip on the camera while still maintaining the cameras pocketability (because it doesn't protrude past the lens assembly).  Of course with the camera grip added, the M3 will not fit in the Sony Leather  camera case.  So it is either one or the other. So to get around this I ordered another OP\/TECH USA Soft Pouch Digital D-Micro (Black) for my M3 which I also have for the M2.  And it fits great.If my review was any help with your decision to purchase, and I hope I was of some help, kindly choose 'Yes' in the comments section below.  Thank You.

SLR cameras and the new generation mirrorless cameras (such as Sony NEX) do provide better quality but are too large and heavy to schlepp around unobtrusively. The RX100 is a camera that is pocketable while giving a dramatic quality advantage over an iPhone 5s. Its beats the larger NEX camera in nearly every aspect. And it is equal or better than bulky SLR cameras (unless you need a true zoom capability).Amazon sent my pre-ordered RX100-3 just in time before leaving on a vacation to Spain. This offered a great opportunity to test my brand-new camera under many different conditions: in dark churches, bright beaches, city panoramas, pictures in musea, selfies, concert videos, etc. After shooting over 700 pictures I am more enthusiastic about this camera than any camera I have owned until now. The pictures are very good. The RX100-3 seems to do most everything right. On top of that, it feels great in the hand as its made of high-quality materials.It shoots razor sharp pictures that are a feast for the eye. The quality difference is immediately apparent when viewed on an retina-display iPad. Thanks to the large 1\" image sensor and F1.8 lens it can crank up the ISO without introducing noise, resulting in spectacular low-light capabilities. I hardly used the flash as there is little need with such great hardware. In bright sunlight the built-in ND filter allows to perform some background defocussing.The built-in viewfinder is unique and turns out to be very useful in practice, especially if you need reading glasses such as myself. Popping it out automatically switches the camera on, popping it back in switches it off again. The regular LCD screen can be tilted 180 degrees to shoot selfies, which is a nice touch. Apropos touch: the LCD screen is not. All controls are with tiny buttons, making for s steep learning curve given the many options of the camera. Sometimes I accidentally pushed one of those buttons, and it turns out to be hard to quickly recover from that. This camera is not for you if you are easily intimidated by options and buttons, or prefer a zen\/Apple style minimal user interface. To make things worse, the built-in help feature is borderline useless. One has to consult the paper manual to understand what the DRO1 or HDR3 is, and what the sweet spot for each is.The easy to grip ring around the lens controls the zoom, focus or exposure (depending on the shooting mode). Compared to the RX100-2, the ring operation is much faster, allowing for smooth zooming. The default 24mm is nicely wide-angle, great for most shots. In some situations a slight zoom in is better to prevent the unavoidable distortion from becoming noticeable. Maximum zoom is only 70mm, which makes this camera no suitable for birdwatchers. I do not mind as most of my shots did not require zoom. I enabled the digital zoom to get a little more zoom range. Given the super high resolution the penalty is not too bad.It is strange that all expensive cameras lack GPS geotagging and easy connectivity. The good news is that the RX100-3 has a built in wifi which avoids messing with adapters and wires.  I used it many times to send pictures to my smartphone and iPad. That still requires a bit too many button clicks, but it does work well and does not depend on external wifi network.I did not have the time to read the manual, but I discovered a few other interesting features in the past 2 weeks of shooting:- It has a built-in 'beautification' tool for those hedonistic selfies: skin smoothing, eye-widening, teeth whitening and more. It worked remarkable well even though it seems a bit of a marketing gimmick.- Sweep panorama pictures can be shot either horizontally or vertically. I found the vertical sweep panorama to be an excellent way to get a wide-angle view without much distortion. All panoramas are shot at 1\/500s.- I still need to figure out when to use 'intelligent auto' and when 'superior auto'. If seems that superior auto is more creative with HDR (multi-exposure) in high contrast situations.- The built-in flash can be aimed upward to the ceiling, resulting in a softer effect.- The viewfinder can show an artificial horizon that helps shooting straight pictures.- Digital zoom has 3 modes: 'off', 'clearimage', and 'on', where 'clearimage' seems to cleverly adjust zoom range to avoid too much resolution loss. (I have not read the manual yet ;)- Battery life turns out to be quite good. I short over 200 pictures on a day and still had 20% battery left.- The camera has a tendency to focus on the front object and defocus the background in auto-mode. That is great for portraits, but not always what is intended. Forcing a larger depth-of focus seems to require using the A or S modes instead.The RX100-3 is probably the best portable camera currently on the market.","rating":5},{"comment":"I've owned both the RX100 and RX100M II. The RX100M III is a major improvement over previous versions.To highlight some improvements and changes:1) The Wi-Fi\/Smart Remote app works betterWhen you power cycle the camera after turning on Wi-Fi, the Wi-Fi is already enabled. In other words, you can turn the cam off, then back on, and the Wi-Fi is connected and ready to go.Depending on your shooting mode, you now have the ability to change certain settings via the Wi-Fi such as exposure.The overall connection is much, much better. With the RX100M II, the connection constantly drops, lags, disconnects, etc. There is still some of the with the M III, but not nearly as bad.2) Better VideoDealing with AVCHD\/.mts files is a pain. The XAVC\/.mp4 format is amazing and allows recording at 50mbps. The quality is out of this world.3) More stabilization optionsThey've included a new &#34;Intelligent Active&#34; mode which has a pretty big crop factor. I don't recommend using it unless you have to (such as riding a bike on gravel). I suggest using Standard mode or leaving it off if possible, allowing for the least amount of crop and better quality. Noise levels on Active and Inteliigent Active are noticeably high.4) Better exposure\/metering and focusingThe problem with the RX100M II is that it has problems with focusing on the foreground. You had to go into macro mode, which is a pain and not suitable for video. It also has problems with exposure and brightening subjects that are against bright lights. The RX100 MII improves on all of these issues.I highly recommend this camera for video. It's hands down the best handheld camera for video in this price range.Suggestions to Sony:A backlight compensation function to further improve brightening subjects that are against lights. I still found shots that would be ruined because the camera would darken a subject in the foreground to highlight everything in the background. Very annoying!","rating":5},{"comment":"Great image quality in both low light and outdoors. Both construction and design are both tops The new DSP and sensor are amazing togeather and allow for all the new formats for video as well as real burst shooting of photos in both RAW and JPEG. Virtually no shutter lag (.8 seconds) as in most pocket sized point & shoot models. Everything that displays on the rear LCD screen is also displayed in the EVF and the 3&#34; LCD shuts off automatically when your face touches the screen when using the EVF as well. I highly recommend getting the MAGfilter circular polarizing filter to eliminate reflected harsh light and the protective case only adds a few MM to the overall size so it's still a pocketable camera.only slightly thicker than an Iphone and still protected from dings, dents and scratches.. One drawback is the thin wriststrap but if you get the case, you can install a really fine wrist strap from Joby that will secure both the camera to the case and also securely to your wrist. Sony supplies small loops for the securing of the case to the camera and the metal stays on the case can support a good JOBY wrist strap (almost a &#34;must have&#34; if you have large hands and fingers).This model comes in second to the $7000 Leica for quality and performance in the point & shoot category at 1\/10th the price. I got this camera to replace the old Nikon S-8300 for my wife and she's thrilled with the performance and features.","rating":5},{"comment":"Met all of my expectations that I had read about beforehand. Image quality is very good. Operational controls are mostly intuitive. Love the size (that's why I bought it). Slips easily into my pocket. The viewfinder is very sharp. The only thing I wish it had is a  larger zoom capability.","rating":4},{"comment":"PROs and CONsPROs:-Excellent image quality. The new lens is noticeably sharper than the previous lens. Detail capture is very good. Slight tendency to overexpose. Colors are a bit neutral but mostly accurate in its default setting. Comparable performance to APS-C up to ISO800. Usable through ISO3200, especially if you process RAW. ISO performance about this same as its predecessor. Possibly slightly worse at high ISO than the Canon G1X Mark II but not that far off.-Good performance. Autofocus speed and accuracy seems to have improved on this model. The AF system does a better job of attempting to lock on to a subject in dim conditions. Image stabilization works well.-Great looking video. About the best you're going to find from a compact camera.-Pop up EVF is sharp and bright, and has a decent refresh rate even in low light conditions.-LCD is bright and clear.CONs-Camera shuts off after EVF is put away.-Manual flash button in an awkward position and can sometimes be hard to push.-Still no textured area on the front of the camera for a more secure grip. Come on Sony! Although the previous add on grip fits just fine on the RX100 III. You should not order this camera without it (I think it's about $10-$15 extra).-Menu is a little convoluted.In summary, this is a great update to this line of cameras. It still offers the best mix of high image\/video quality for such a small package. Despite the quirks I just mentioned, the camera is generally pretty enjoyable to shoot with and the photos\/video give similarly priced APS-C cameras a run for their money at the low and mid range ISOs people use most. If you have the original RX100, should you upgrade? Yes, absolutely. If you have the RX100 II? Well, the lens isn't as sharp but still pretty good. Low light performance is exactly the same. But perhaps you like the longer lens and the hotshoe of the Mark II and don't care about the EVF...then it might be worthwhile to skip a generation. Is the RX100 III worth the extra money? I think it is.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is the camera I have been waiting a looooong time for.I am a professional photographer who does a lot of work overseas. So I find myself traveling with all of my camera gear packed into my Thinktank rolling bag and always have liked to have a small fast camera to use in case I saw something I wanted to shoot. Be it something that just peaked my interest or even if I was on a flight where the flight attendant decided to strip naked, swig a bottle of champagne, and then deploy the emergency shoot and run away (no that has not really happened on any flights I've been on, but, you know, it could).I wanted to be able to make a picture of something if I needed\/wanted to without having to drag my roller out of the overhead and pull a camera out or feeling like the image quality would suffer because of the compromise of having a smaller point and shoot camera. But every other P\/S camera I have used over the years left me feeling just that way... it was an image quality compromise either because the sensor was not very good or because the lens was slow, or the camera was painfully laggy.So I usually ended up carrying one of my Canon 5d mkIII bodies over my shoulder with the 24-70 on it... which is also not an ideal solution because you have to take it through security and try to keep it from swinging around while carrying bags, etc... then you have to find somewhere to put it once you get on your flight.Then I saw this camera... and fell in love with it. The image quality is amazing. It has a sharp and fast Zeiss lens 24-70 f1.8-2.8, fast and accurate autofocus, great fps rate (if you need it), and absolutely knockout image quality. I actually used this to shoot some work for a client (alongside my regular pro gear) and a liked a couple of the images so much that they made it into the edit and it is hard to tell the difference between the images shot with pro dslr's and the RX-100M III.This is also the perfect vacation camera or for trips with the kids where I don't want to lug my work gear. It is small and light but is good enough to shoot just about anything that they end up doing on a daytrip\/vacation.I have been very pleased with the battery life on this camera. It seems to go an awfully long time for such a small battery.I also like how easy it is to operate settings like exposure compensation, flash modes, etc. on this camera. It takes seconds and minimal button pushing to reach most of the features one regularly accesses on a small camera like this. Sony really thought this through when designing it.I can't say enough about how good the image quality is. I have not shot the camera in jpg mode, only in raw, but in some very tricky lighting situations (kids in mid-day sun wearing hats on carnival rides) where you would expect a point-and-shoot to stumble, the Sony produces an image with more than enough latitude to burn and dodge a bit to end up with an amazing image. Color looks good as does the contrast. It seems to do a great job with white balance in less than ideal light, too.Finally, the perfect carry-around small camera to compliment my pro gear has arrived.","rating":5},{"comment":"Before I placed my order for this camera, I tried to avoid going through the same scenario that I experienced once I discovered the deal-breaking limitations of the RX10 (see my review). One of them was the inability for the camera to capture still photos while shooting video. I contacted Sony Technical Support and asked if the RX100M III had this essential feature (for my use as an event camera person). I was reassured that this feature was available and went forward with placing the order. When I received the camera, I quickly discovered that like in the RX10, still photos were not possible while shooting video, which was later confirmed by a different person at Sony Technical Support. As I stated in my review of the RX10, there are several cameras that I own (including the older HX9V and TX-10) that do offer this feature. Recently, I purchased the HDR-CX900 video camera, and low and behold, this feature was available! There is no logic as to why Sony chooses some of their models to have it and some not. Just be aware that the RX100M III does not have this feature if you are looking for it.","rating":3},{"comment":"I bought the RX100 in its original configuration a few years ago when it first came out. I liked the camera from the outset and have taken more than a few pictures with it that I am really happy with. It is my choice for backing up my Nikon D4 or D800 when I can't deal with taking along two large DSLRs. I took a look at DXO mark and they rate the sensor the same as the sensor for my old D200 which may sound like damning with faint praise but the D200 was a workhorse and shot a lot of great stuff. I will say at the outset that I like the M3 a lot. I am happy I upgraded from the original but I think that if you have the M2 you may not need this update. The faster lens is a noticeable improvement. Indoor shots without flash at reasonable ISO's are much more feasible now.Updated 6\/24\/14 - I thought I would add a comment about a statement from the dpreview piece on the M3. Dpreview praises the cameras abilities and then go on to say that it is not \"fun\" to shoot with. I guess an old SX-70 may have been more fun with all the whirring and spitting of prints but beyond that I am at a loss. I have had great creative session with both the M1 and M3. In fact, one of my favorite things about the camera is that is so easy and transparent to handle.Pros:Articulating LCD - I think this is a huge improvement over the original RX100. The ability to easily shoot high or low angle pictures is a great advantage. I have always liked using compact cameras from the ant's eye view and this makes it a lot easier to do. Like most of the construction of the RX100m3, the articulating LCD feels well built but clearly this is not a ruggedized camera. Care must be taken with the flash, EVF and LCD or damage could result. Things don't feel cheap they just don't feel \"battle ready\"Picture Quality - I really like the output of the RX100M3. The pictures are sharp, vivid and relatively free of noise at moderate ISO settings. One of the big improvements in the area of low light is the enhanced widest aperture of the lens. One can pixel peep any lens into a corner (no pun intended) but Sony has done a very respectable job here. I will discuss this more later but by going with a fast, modest zoom with a nice wide end, Sony has created a more enthusiast oriented camera. As Robert Capa said, \"If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough.\"Zoom - As mentioned above the zoom range is modest. I just really like the ability to use 24mm equivalent at the wide end. The zoom speed is quite good. Again, I think it compares favorably to other high-end compacts that I have used.EVF - When I opened the EVF for the first time and look through it was terrible. Then I adjusted the diopter and it was beautiful. Seriously beautiful. This is my first EVF and I like it very much. I can see using it a great deal with this camera.Shutter - The shutters drops very quickly without any undue lag. I really like the burst mode on this camera with the shutter sounds turned off. It is a great way to get very natural candids of friends and family.Neutrals:Weight - The RX100M3 is noticeably heavier than the original. Noticeably but not significantly heavier. Yes, when you pick it up you are just a touch more cognizant of gravities pull but nowhere near the point where you would leave on the table because it's too heavy to deal with. When carrying and using the camera the extra weight never crossed my mind.Size - Certainly related to weight but also a function of adding goodies like the EVF and articulating LCD. I wear a lot of clothes with big pockets and I have never been one to just stuff a compact camera in a pants pocket on an ongoing basis. I have a very small Lowepro belt case for my original RX100 and the new one fits perfectly even with an extra battery tucked inside. The size and weight differences are certainly discreet.Added 6\/22\/14 The current implementation of the Fn button is very nice. I really didn't use this button in the past but now it brings up a very clear, easy to follow UI for the some of the most commonly accessed functions. I really like this feature.Added 6\/22\/14 I am growing very fond of the artificial horizon in the EVF. Despite 30+ years of photography I am still amazed how often in Lightroom I have to straighten the horizon. Maybe my head is just tilted. Whatever the cause, the artificial horizon really helps and as a result I am not losing any of the frame having to rotate in post.Cons:Menus - While the menu system on the M3 is improved and certainly better than the old NEX software it could still use improvement. My biggest complaint has to do with navigating between menu categories and sub-menus. To me the UI manipulation is not intuitive but is certainly workable.Functions - Marketing people are wonderful and I know scene modes and scene recognition must be important to some segment of customers but I am not in that demographic. I suppose there is little harm in all the bells and whistles but it is very funny that Sony includes both an Automatic and Superior Automatic mode. When does one say, \"I don't want the superior results, let me kick this baby down to stinky normal Automatic mode.\"Items on which the jury is still out.Wi-fi - I know there are people who can't wait for the favorite camera to come out with built in wi-fi so it can't be dismissed. I would only say that thus far my experience with the RX100M3's wi-fi functions have been cursory and I will amend this review when I am able to be more definitive about my experience.Would I recommend this camera?For a lot of people yes I would. If you are an enthusiast this is a credible compact contender. If you are an ultralight traveller who likes good photos this is also a good choice. If you are thinking of some for an adventure vacation with water, snow, sand or surf, probably better to look at a ruggedized compact. Up until the RX100 all my compacts had been Canon's and they were great. I am happy with the move to Sony and believe I will be happy with the M3 for several years.","rating":5},{"comment":"I (and many) have been waiting for this model of the RX100 series. It was the addition of the amazing EVF pop-up (looks exactly like my RX10 EVF), the bright 1.8-2.8 lens, the (finally!) cool &#34;we-fie&#34; flip-up LCD screen, a pop-up flash that can be flicked back for a good fill flash effect), and the inclusion of the more modern ALPHA operating system. Handheld twilight, Anti-motion blur, are all here. Quiet, quick, and efficient.OK, its all near perfection. All I can add is that It is a bit of a chunk, but solid. It will fit in pants pockets but you will know that its there. It is a bit heavy and slippery while trying to shoot with one hand (needs only a tiny grip). Use the wrist strap! It's the 1-inch sensor (like the RX10) so it has a ~2.5 crop factor, which limits the smooth bokeh you might expect. It cannot accept filters.Other than that, sell what you have a get this.","rating":5},{"comment":"This computer has great specs. Of course, all-in-one units are pricier than the same hardware in a desktop and stand-alone monitor, but they do take up less space. So you have to weigh convenience against cost.The 12 Gb's of memory in this model is huge, and that's a positive. So is the i7 processor. The one drawback is the (in modern terms) lowly 1 Tb hard drive. However, with high capacity USB drives readily available at bargain prices, that's not really so bad.The computer was literally a snap to set up. The stand snaps firmly into the back of the computer with metal connections, and then the base screws onto the bottom of the upright. No tools are required. You can literally have it out of the box, plugged in and booting inside of five minutes.When unpacking, be careful to find the USB dongle, which is nestled right into the cardboard. It would be easy to overlook if you don't pay attention, and you'll need it for the keyboard and mouse.Speaking of the keyboard and mouse, they are the excessively cheap kind that are bundled with most computers these days. You probably won't want to use them long term, and that's part of why I hold back a star. No matter how good the computer itself is, you are constantly interacting with it via the keyboard and mouse, and if that experience isn't good, it hinders the impression made by the package, and that is the case here. Each takes two batteries, which are included. The TOP of the mouse snaps off to install its batteries, and it didn't seem that it really wanted to snap back together that securely. Expect to use your favored keyboard\/mouse combo from your previous computer or replace these with something sturdy and with better ergonomics, and soon. There was a time when new computers came with much more acceptable keyboards, but those days seem to have vanished.The touch screen is a nice touch (haha) that is more a gimmick in my eyes than a truly useful feature. Who wants to constantly clean skin oils and other finger introduced dirt from their monitor? Dust is bad enough as it is. Plus the touch doesn't really have very fine control. In trying to close a window using the &#34;X&#34;, and actually touching only the X, the monitor often read the touch a bit to the left, minimizing the window instead of closing it.In a brief encounter with the camera I wasn't impressed. I started to use it to create a new user icon. The picture it produced of me looking at the computer was grainy and faded. And watch out ladies ... it made me look fat. LOL (I'm not). That's another part of the one star deduction.Finally, if you haven't changed computers in a few years and are still on Windows 7, even the &#34;improved Windows 8.1&#34; will still be a combination of culture shock and constant irritation. Windows 8 was Microsoft's attempt to dumb down the interface, and it is a pretty dumb interface. I immediately got a $5 utility from Stardock that emulates the Windows 7 interface. While this isn't a complaint peculiar to this computer, it is an issue that many people have to deal with when upgrading their hardware. I skipped an entire generation of hardware just to avoid Vista, for example (and I wasn't alone).The built-in speakers sounded OK. I really can't compare them much as I never use computer speakers. I don't play sound in games, watch video, or play music through a computer itself (all that goes out to my TV and stereo system when the need arises).I found the wireless network card to be extremely peppy. In browsing and simple file copying I couldn't tell a perceptible difference from my wired network connection on my desktop.This all-in-one unit compares VERY favorably against a couple of models of HP that I bought for a client last year. I like the image on this monitor better than those. The models aren't strictly comparable as the HPs were lower priced, with less memory and processor power, but they are the only other all-in-ones I've had much experience with. For my own use, I prefer the extra power, memory and screen quality of this Dell at the higher price point.Recommended, with the caveats noted above.","rating":4},{"comment":"First off, the screen of the Dell Inspiron i5348-8889BLK 23-Inch Touchscreen All-in-One Desktop is WONDERFUL, BIG, and BRIGHT.  I knew it was going to be a 23\" monitor when I ordered it, but you have no idea how big that is until it actually arrives.  The touchscreen capability is flawless (I have two iPod Touchs, an iPad, and an iPad mini so I have experience with how a touchscreen SHOULD work).  The picture and resolution is really clear with its Intel HD and 1920 x 1080 resolution - which is better than any of my other monitors (or my TV).  The on-board video card is only an average stock variety so I would not expect to be able to play very graphics-intensive games on it.The RAM - 12GB Dual Channel DDR3 1600MHz (8GBx1 + 4GBx1) - is above average for what most computers come with nowadays.  Even RAM-hog games recommend that you have a minimum of 8 GB - so 12GB is definitely an upgrade.  The processor, a 4th Generation Core i7-4770S (8M Cache, up to 3.1 GHz), is blazing fast and definitely hits not only the minimum requirements, but also what's recommended for computer-intensive software, applications, and games.  The onboard memory is a sufficient 1 TB.  So it's basically bigger than you can fill in a lifetime unless you load all kind of movies onto it.The computer came with very little software pre-loaded - basically a trial version ofMicrosoft Office Home 2013,Cyberlink Media Suite, and other minor software programs (Microsoft Signature Image, Cycle 1, WinBlu, and MSSI).  However, apps and programs are very easily added through the Microsoft Store - and a great number of them are free.  Not having used a non-Apple app, I found the applications very similar (if not the same) as what you can find on the App Store (Skype, MLB.com, Angry Birds, etc).  Windows 8's default setting also displays your apps and software in a similar way as the Apple iOS interface, although with a click of the mouse you can return the screen to the old \"Windows\" look.  One thing I had an issue with was Windows 8 doesn't really show you that you have several programs running in the background and\/or how to shut them off.  I hear that the 8.1 update upgrades the functionality of and closed some of the bugs of Win 8 so having this as the OS is a bonus over last year's Dell products.The HD Audio with Waves MaxxAudio audio-processing sound beautiful - which I was pretty surprised about considering how small the speakers appear.  The computer comes with only a optical DVD player\/burner.  Several other models of Dell Touchscreen computers come with Blu-Ray players, but again the Dell Inspiron is a somewhat middle-of-the-road model.  This Dell Inspiron also comes with an in-monitor video camera which is great for Skyping family or whatever you could use it for.  I counted five USB ports (with two utilizing USB 3.0) and one HDMI port.  It is kind of tight back there with most of the ports clustered in the center of the screen back right behind the monitor stand.  I had to put the computer down on its face to plug the power cord in which is sub-optimal and with several components plugged in at once, the back of your computer can turn into a Christmas tree lights bundle.  However, there are two USB ports and the speaker ports on the side of the computer which is much easier to utilize.  I was somewhat disappointed with the standard keyboard that comes with the computer.  It was very small and flat and I not only found it somewhat hard to use, but also I couldn't use it long without my wrists getting sore.  The mouse is decent and both are wireless which nowadays is a must-have.Since this is an all-in-one computer\/monitor and a 23\" monitor, the weight of the computer may be an issue.  It doesn't weigh a ton, but I'm just noting that it's a lot more than even my 30\" monitor that I have on my desktop and a little more than my 22\" IBM laptop.  That being said, the monitor stand is strong, heavy duty, and really great with its dual-hinge capability.  I had no problems positioning the screen without it sliding down from its own weight.  Obviously there are other options when it comes to monitor sizes.  Dell alone sells several different sized all-on-ones including theDell XPS One 27 XPSo27-6476BK 27-Inch Touch All-in-One Desktop,Dell Inspiron 2020 io2020T-5000BK 20-Inch All-in-One Touchscreen DesktopandDell XPS 18 XPSo18-2728BLK 18.4-Inch All-in-One Touchscreen Portable Desktopwhich are of varying prices and quality.  So its really up to you.  I think the 23\" monitor really caters to the power-user who is looking for not only a big computer monitor, but also who might simultaneously use this as another television.The Dell Inspiron i5348-8889BLK 23-Inch Touchscreen All-in-One Desktop is big and beautiful and in my mind, this would be the perfect computer to setup in your kitchen or living room - allows you to watch TV, listen to music, run software programs or apps, and quickly access the web all in a convenient central location.  The negatives I list above - that are actually about something that Dell can control - are minor when the positives so clearly outweigh everything else.  I do knock it on not having a Blu-Ray player (5 years ago I wouldn't have, but Blu-Ray is \"the\" standard now) and the video card is substandard considering the pretty decent processor and RAM size.  If Dell keeps turning out computers like this, they'll not only save the company, but also resurrect the Dell brand name.","rating":4},{"comment":"this computer was an easy assembly and an even easier start up; it found our wireless network and other devices easily. The graphics are exceptional with bright colors. it is quiet and fast; the touchscreen is the first such that I have owned so there is some getting used to that feature. all in all, a fantastic machine that is a pleasure to use daily.","rating":5},{"comment":"I've been using these Dell All-In-One systems in our store as Kiosks over the last year and have been impressed.  That's why I was excited to get one for our house.After using it for the last couple of weeks, here are the things I like about it:1) It looks great!  The computer it was replaced was a traditional tower computer, that I had built myself, with a 24\" monitor - and this Dell eliminates both the tower and all associated wires.  Our home office looks a lot cleaner as a result.2) The screen quality is excellent!3) The touch screen is nice - and I've really started to get used to that on Windows 8 systems.  It's kind of hard to switch to non-touch systems once you get used to that feature.4) It runs completely silently.  This is something I demand in all my PCs.5) I hate factory images because of all the bloatware that's installed; and, as a result, I typically reformat and re-install before even booting a system up.  I was in the process of getting my install disks together when I saw a note in the box that said this system shipped with a clean image - so I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did because it saved me the time of doing a re-install!  The image is a truly clean Windows 8 system, and I've got to hand it to Dell for finally figuring out that it makes more sense to ship systems without all the additional software.Although I am loving this system in general, I do have one complaint:When looking at the specs, this should be an absolute beast - but it isn't.  I suspect the weak link is the 5400 RPM hard drive - which doesn't match up with the Core i7 and the 12GB of RAM...I've added SSD drives into my other computers, so I'll probably do the same with this one - and that should make this one of the fastest computers I own.At the end of the day, I would highly recommend this system even though the performance isn't quite what I had expected.  Once again, I suspect that performance is due to the fact that I'm used to systems running off of SSD drives - which makes a huge difference.These all-in-ones have finally gotten to a point where they truly are good enough to replace standard tower systems!","rating":5},{"comment":"This is one amazing computer. The computer is very fast, the monitor is very bright, the camera produces good video quality, the touch surface is very responsive, the sound quality is actually very good, the location of the USB ports (4 in back, 2 on left side) is convenient and the wireless keyboard and mouse make for less cable spaghetti. Windows 8.1 works very well on it and I had no problem installing almost all of my usual programs. One caveat though, games don't do well on it. Several of my games installed but wouldn't start. One of the things that I really appreciate is how quiet it is: no fan ramping up or anything. So, if you are in the market for a new Windows 8 computer I would certainly recommend it. BTW it comes with very little useless software pre-installed and setting it up required no real PC knowledge so if you are concerned about technical challenges, be at ease, this one is quite straightforward.","rating":5},{"comment":"I had bought another all-in-one computer a few months back and so when I was offered this one I was thrilled to have something to compare it to.  The biggest plus is definitely the touch screen.  I also liked the upgraded version of Windows 8 - it removes many of the negatives people were complaining about.Pros:Touch screen works great and is easy to workNice, large screen and nice colors and videoHas built in microphone and cameraWireless keyboard and mouse work great, even from across the room (great for movies!)Internet was super easy to set up and get workingNice programs included; nothing too fancy, but many free games and a really cool paint program that my kids lovedNice, fast processor!  The entire computer was super quick.Cons:Integrated Graphics. These have a tendency to have issues with games as the computer gets outdated and you can't &#34;fix&#34; it by upgrading a video card!  Especially for the price, I would have expected a better video card. I must admit it works great, so maybe this is my previous stigma towards integrated cards that's the issue here.Overall, I highly recommend it.  If you haven't used an all-in-one before I have to say I think you will love it... EVERYTHING is there, the screen is the computer, the cd drive is in the side of the screen, etc... it just makes it really, really easy to set up.  Basically you only have to have one wire going down to the power; no more obnoxious wires all over the place!","rating":5},{"comment":"The 16-35mm focal lengths are some of the most useful zoom ranges available, ideal for architecture, landscapes, street photography, photojournalism, even environmental portraits when used properly. I've been a photojournalist for over 30 years and just received my new Canon 16-35 f\/4L IS to replace my old 16-35 f\/2.8 version 1. I bought this new f\/4 version because, frankly, the old 16-35 version 1 isn't very sharp (v. 2 isn't much better), especially at the corners.I shot a quick side-by-side test at f\/4 at 16mm, 24mm and 35mm. My initial impression is that the new 16-35 f\/4 blows the old 16-35 f\/2.8 version 1 out of the water and, here's the kicker: it appears similar in quality to the awesome 24-70 f\/2.8L II! Even out of focus highlights appear crisper and better defined when compared to version 1.The IS works perfectly under low light and I really appreciate that I can still use my expensive 77mm CP filter. I will miss the f\/2.8 speed, but thanks to the low light abilities of modern DSLR bodies, it shouldn't prove a serious handicap. Canon deserves kudos for producing a truly sharp extreme wide angle zoom at a reasonable price.UPDATE: I just finished a series of tests comparing the 16-35 f\/2.8 (version 1) vs. the 16-35 f\/4L IS vs. the 24-70 f\/2.8L II. The new Canon 16-35 f\/4L IS lens makes my old 16-35 f\/2.8 version 1 look pathetic. The centers of all three lenses are similar at f\/4, but the corners of the new 16-35 f\/4L IS are just phenomenal! Sharpness, resolution, color fringing, resistance to flare are amazing and easily match my fabulous overpriced 24-70 f\/2.8L II.The IS on the new 16-35 f\/4 provides exceptional stability for hand-holding under low light. The relatively compact lens hood is less cumbersome and includes a pinch-style lens cap. Though few will miss it, the new design does not incorporate a gel filter holder on the rear like the old 16-35 f\/2.8 version 1. I'm a photojournalist and prefer a f\/2.8 lens, but the optics on this new lens are so darn good that I'm going to slap that bad boy on one of my 5D III bodies and leave it there.","rating":5},{"comment":"Although I am a Canon devotee, I'm the first to admit that wide zooms are the one area in which Nikon lenses have been superior.  Until now.  This new lens is dramatically better in the corners than the much-loved but not very good 17-40 lens.  It's also better in the corners than either of Canon's 16-35 f\/2.8 lenses.The 16-35\/4 IS is fabulous (at least for a zoom) at f\/5.6 and except for corner darkening, it's very good at f\/4.  Size, weight and price are all reasonable for what you are getting and with image stabilization you can handhold at longer shutter speeds, making f\/4 adequate for most situations.Why not 5 stars?  As mentioned earlier, it's dark in the corners, wide open at 16mm.  I don't mind this, but you might.  The other thing is distortion.  The good news is that the barrel distortion at 16mm is less than Nikon's 16-35, but it's still there, and at the 35mm end, the Canon 16-35 IS has noticeably more pincushion than the Nikon 16-35 VR. For many types of photography, this barrel-pincushion business won't matter but assuming 5 stars means perfection then no, the lens is not perfect.So, unless you absolutely must have an f\/2.8 lens, the 16-35\/4 IS is the way to go.  With this lens, I can't think of any lens Nikon offers that Canon does not equal or surpass.  Ok, maybe the 14 -24.  But the 16-35\/4 IS is as sharp as my 24mm IS lens, and reasonably close to my 24 TS II.  For a zoom, this is very good performance.","rating":4},{"comment":"Bought this lens before any review in hopes Canon would live up to their reputation and deliver a great lens.  I was right.  Bottom line : it's better than my 17-40 L.  I took it out today and photographed antelope canyon slots in Page AZ.  I've been there two other times in the past so I knew what to expect.  The images are crisper and just have an overall better look.  I have it mounted to a 5diii.  Hope this helps.  Sure you can find a ton of technical info online by now.Will update when I use the Image stabilization.  Planning on a trip to Glacier NP with the family.  Planing on doing handheld landscape shots with my kiddos as foreground. Also planing a few boat outing where I think the IS will be handy.","rating":5},{"comment":"A nice wide angle lens which could be faster.","rating":4},{"comment":"Canon's promises of top IQ and image stabilization in a wide zoom enticed me and the EF 16-35mm 4L IS USM landed in my camera bag. Here's what I thought about it after a couple weeks of shooting.CONSTRUCTION is exemplary with quality plastics, attractive semi-matte finish and sturdy metal mount. Electrical switches are beefy and nearly impossible to inadvertently change. The ribbed rubber zoom and focus rings are large and grippy, and positioned similarly to my 24-105 4L and 70-200 4L, making switching between these lenses seamless. Finally, the 16-35 is noticeably larger and heavier than the 17-40 4L but feels solid and balanced on a 6D or 5D series.FOCUS is achieved by an internal element group so length doesn't change. AF is blazing fast and accurate on my 6D. The manual focus (MF) ring is smooth and finely pitched, allowing precise adjustments. MF is always active and doesn't require flipping a switch.ZOOMING is smooth and precise and doesn't drift when pointed up or down. Zoom operation is quasi-internal: front element moves sightly within the barrel but doesn't turn or protrude. Due to front element movement, the manual indicates a filter is required for dust and drip resistance.IMAGE STABILIZATION (IS) gave me two additional stops of hand holdable range at 16mm and three stops at 35mm. But not the four-stops claimed by Canon. Somebody with a more steady hand might squeeze out another stop.OPTICAL PERFORMANCE wide open is sharp and significantly better along corners and edges compared to my 17-40 4L. In other words, sharp across the entire frame. The best overall performance is from 16mm to 24mm, with ever so slight deterioration towards 35mm. There is a wee bit of light falloff (darkening of corners) at F4 but better in this regard than the 17-40 4L and 24-105 4L. By F8 light falloff fades to near nothing. If you shoot JPEGs, Peripheral Illumination Correction can automatically reduce light falloff. RAW shooters may correct with a few clicks in Lightroom or DPP. The wee bit of distortion is also easily corrected in PP.Chromatic Aberration (CA) is well controlled: a tiny amount of magenta fringing is visible via pixel peeking in corners at 16mm, but almost nothing at longer settings. It certainly bests my 17-40 4L my a large margin in this regard. Beyond high contrast situations--tree branches against bright sky--and pixel peeping in corners, I'd never notice CA.Sunsets, spotlights and other bright light sources were sharp and suffered little flare. However, I could invoke flare at certain zoom settings by shooting with the blazing summer sun in the frame. Oddly 24mm was almost impossible to flare but 28mm showed a tiny ghost image. Use of the included EW-82 hood is a good idea albeit my hat is often more effective at flare busting. The EW-83 is nicely designed: petal shape and significantly smaller but deeper than the silly dish-like hood that came with the 17-40.LAST BLURB: The 16-35 4L delivers satisfyingly sharp, contrasty and vivid images, and is perfect for landscapes, mammoth train stations or cramped interiors. I especially enjoying using it for shooting video and stills on a cramped stage. It's a joy to use and boasts excellent handling and surefooted AF. Plus, IS gave me confidence to shoot in low light and vibration-prone venues I didn't dare tread until now.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have owned and used the16-35mm f\/2.8L IIlens for several years now. While it is a fantastic lens, I was never thrilled with its performance in the corners for landscapes, which for me was the primary reason for owning the lens. I switched to using theTS-E 17mm f\/4Lfor landscapes and my 16-35mm f\/2.8 usually just stayed in my bag - in fact I didn't even bring it along on my last photo trip. Now with the release of this new 16-35mm f\/4L IS, my camera bag will always contain an ultra-wide angle zoom lens. I plan on making it my go-to landscape lens, and probably will only use the TS-E 17mm lens when I actually need the tilt or shift. This lens plus a70-200mm f\/4L ISwill likely be the only two zoom lenses I carry for photo trips.The image quality is nearly prime like - I see little to no difference in the corners between this lens and the TS-E 17mm (without tilt or shift), even wide-open at f\/4. Image quality in the center is fantastic, but the center was never a problem with any of Canon's ultra-wide zoom lens. Corner quality in their other ultra-wide zoom lenses have always disappointed, but this lens reverses that trend, delivering excellent image quality across the frame. Photos are sharp and contrasty, in the center and in the corners. If you are familiar with Canon's other recently released zoom lenses, such as the 70-200mm f\/2.8L IS II or 24-70mm f\/2.8L II, you can expect similar results from this lens - fantastic.Like most zoom lenses, there is some distortion at the extreme ends of the range - slight barrel distortion at 16mm and pincushion at 35mm, while there is almost none around 24mm. The amount of distortion appears to be similar to the 16-35mm f\/2.8L II. Generally I have not found distortion to be a problem photographing landscapes with the f\/2.8 lens, so this lens should perform similarly. Distortion can be fixed in software, but usually comes at the cost of a slight crop along with some loss of image quality.The 16-35mm f\/4L IS has a 9-bladed aperture, which will result in 18-point stars from specular highlights (such as the sun) when using narrow apertures. The 16-35mm f\/2.8L II has a 7-bladed aperture, which results in 14-point stars. Which is preferred is subjective, but generally I prefer more points on specular highlights. More blades on the aperture also improves bokeh ball look when stopped down, but on such a wide angle lens, only photos at the closest focusing distance have a chance of producing any sort of significant bokeh, and will be even less likely when stopped down.As most of my landscape photos are taken from a tripod, since I often take long exposures or multiple exposures for HDR, the IS will likely not benefit many of my photos. However, I will be glad to have IS when hiking and stopping to take a quick photo. For any single exposures, a tripod will no longer be needed.Build-quality of this lens is typical of most L lenses - excellent. It is very similar in look and feel to the 24-70mm f\/2.8L II or 24-70mm f\/4L IS. The body is plastic instead of metal, but it has a very solid feel and likely allows the lens to be a little lighter and cheaper vs. using a light metal such as magnesium. Like other recent Canon L lenses, it the hood features a finish that is less likely to show scratches and has a lock to ensure the hood cannot accidentally rotate. The hood on the 16-35mm f\/2.8L II was very wide and took up a lot of bag space, so I often found myself leaving it at home. The hood on the 16-35mm f\/4L IS is narrower, more like the hood that comes with the 24-70mm f\/2.8L II. I predict I will actually be using the hood that comes with this lens.The fluorine coating on the front element will be a welcome addition to those that prefer not to use filters. Water and dirt wipe off much easier compared to lenses without a fluorine coating. I usually carry someZeiss alcohol wipesto keep my gear clean. Remember that a filter is required to complete the dust and water resistance, so be sure to use a protection filter when using the lens in dusty or moist conditions.Those looking to stop motion, such as event photographers, may still want to buy the 16-35mm f\/2.8L II, since IS is not going to replace that f\/2.8 aperture. Otherwise the 16-35mm f\/4L IS has better image quality, image stabilization, and costs less, so there's little reason to consider the 16-35mm f\/2.8L II. The17-40mm f\/4Llens is cheaper than this lens, but lacks IS and also suffers from poor corner performance and vignetting. While the focal lengths are similar, I would also prefer having the extra 1mm at the wide-end (which is significant at wide focal lengths) over the extra 5mm at the tele-end. If you can afford it, buy the 16-35mm f\/4L IS.I have long felt that an ultra-wide angle zoom lens that was fantastic for landscapes was missing from Canon's lineup of lenses. I am happy to say with the release of this lens, that is no longer the case.","rating":5},{"comment":"I own the Canon 10-22 USM and love it, and I also had good experiences using the Canon STM lenses.  So the combination of both wide angle and STM just makes sense.  After first inspection, the lens is just slightly smaller than the 10-22 mm, made of solid durable plastic, and amazingly light.  The only real major thing missing form the 10-18 is the distance scale and maybe the extra 4 mm of zoom from the more expensive 10-22.  Combined with the Canon SL1, and this is one light duo.  The focus speeds between the two lenses are negligible.  USM is very quiet but after using the 10-18, STM is absolutely silent.  I even put my ear up to the lens to try to hear any focusing and nothing.  Video can be taken in Liveview using autofocus with no mechanical noise.  Both lenses produce great image quality.  The game changer is the IS.  In low light with the slightest shake using the 10-22 and the picture is out of focus.  With the 10-18, there is a higher chance of images coming in focus with minor shaking or motion.  Upon further inspection, the 10-18 produces sharper images, but I didnnotice some grain\/noise overall when zoomed in.  My 10-22 produces much smoother images with noticeable less sharpening.  This could be a deal breaker for some people but I prefer the ability to use IS and have my images sharp and in focus.  I noticed that the front lens glass element does not sit flush with the zoom zoom\/focus ring and body of the lens at 10mm.  It will sit flush when the zoom ring is set to 14mm.  This worries me because I mainly shoot wide open at 10mm and I leave the lens in that position when it goes into my bag, potentially allowing dust or cause damage to the lens.  Can anyone else verify that with their 10-18?  I find I use this lens much more than the my 10-22.  It has been a good run with the 10-22 but I think there is a new king of ultra wide zooms for the APS-C sensor Canon cameras.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a great lens for landscape and night photography. It's lightweight but produces images that rival those of much heavier L lenses (except prime L lenses, of course). Like the old Canon EF-S 10-22mm and practically all ultra-wide angle lenses, images are a little bit soft in the corners at 10mm. But at 12mm and up, even the corners are sharp. This lens will most likely bring down the price of the old 10-22mm and other third party wide angle lenses. I took one star because of the \"kit lens\" build quality.","rating":4},{"comment":"As a long time photographer who's scaling back from big glass for the carry around convenience I was really surprised on how great the images were and usability of this lens compared to my 17-35.  One of my favorite lenses for my 70D","rating":5},{"comment":"This an excellent lens especially for indoor or outdoor architectural photography.  Nice price point and good quality glass.  Would definitely recommend if you are shooting real estate or interior design work.","rating":5},{"comment":"The EF-S 10-18 4.5-5.6 IS STM is the least expensive and smallest APS-C wide zoom among a small field of contenders. Here's what I thought about it after a couple weeks of shooting:CONSTRUCTION: Save for optical elements and electronics, it's entirely made of plastic. Plastics are high quality and the barrel is well finished in semi-matte. I could detect no wobble or play in the mount or zoom extension. This petite lens is a featherlight 240g and easy to slip in a coat pocket or purse.FOCUS is internal--no front element extension or turning--and fast, but silent to onboard mics. The STM drive rendered pulls and Movie Servo silky smooth on a 70D. I found STM focus equally effective for both video and stills and surprisingly surefooted in low light. The electronic or \"by wire\" manual focus is smooth, finely pitched and has a long rotation (100+), making pulls and fine adjustments a snap. While the FTM feature allows full time manual focus without flipping a switch, the gotcha is it only works when the camera is powered up with the shutter button half-pressed. The focus ring is thin and tricky to locate by feel.ZOOM: The ribbed zoom ring is large, grippy and smooth in rotation. During zoom operation, a small nested barrel extends from the main barrel at 10mm and 18mm, and is fully retracted at 14mm. The 10-18 range is only 1.8X, but short ratios are the norm for ultra wide zooms.IMAGE STABILIZER (IS) gives me two additional stops of hand holdable range at 10mm and three stops at 18mm. But not the four-stops claimed by Canon. Somebody with a more steady hand might squeeze out another stop. Also, IS was very quiet and I was unable to hear it on video with the built-in mics.OPTICAL PERFORMANCE wide open is sharp center frame but slightly soft towards the edges. Stop down to F8 and extremities sharpen up nicely. Sharpness is consistent across most of the zoom range, with only minor degradation towards the long end. There's slight barrel distortion at the wide end but distortion is negligible as you zoom towards 18mm. Chromatic aberration is well controlled with only a pixel or two of magenta fringing along high contrast edges. e.g., tree branches against a bright sky. However, it's easy to remove in DPP, LR or Aperture. In normal light you'll never notice magenta fringing.Photos of sunsets, spotlights and other bright light sources were sharp with well controlled flare (no filter installed). I could invoke flare with the afternoon sun (summer) in the frame and stopping down to F11 or 16. Use of a hood is highly recommended to help protect from stray light, doggie noses and raindrops. Unfortunately, the EW-73C hood is considered an accessory and costs a cringe worthy $29. I expect a price drop and\/or inexpensive EW-73C knockoff to be available in the near future.Light falloff (corner darkening) is pronounced: heavy vignetting at 10mm from F4.5 until F11. It lessens as you zoom toward 18 and\/or stop down, but is always there. If you shoot JPEGs, Peripheral Illumination Correction can automatically reduce light falloff. RAW shooters may correct with a few clicks in Lightroom or DPP.The dilemma is choosing between this lens and theEF-S 10-22mm f\/3.5-4.5 USM. Image quality is a tossup so choice revolves around other features. For example, the USM lens has 4mm of extra reach (2.2X vs 1.8X), faster aperture, better build, internal focus and zoom, distance scale and metal mount. On the other hand, the STM lens is $300 less (!), smaller and lighter, includes IS and the STM drive is better for video.LAST BLURB: Obviously, Canon cut corners to swing this price point but managed to do so with few compromises in optical quality or function. The result is a marvelous lightweight zoom for landscapes, tight quarters or any situation a sweeping view is desired. Anyway you slice it, the EF-S 10-18mm f\/4.5-5.6 IS STM is a great performer and value.","rating":5},{"comment":"$300, this is the best ultra wide angle lens for your Canon DSLR camera!

It was a bit of a pain since I had to use the wall electical outlet to extend the network since the whole house is not wired for ethernet and it took up plug space and just looks a little clunky.  I used to use Linksys, but found Asus to be rather reliable with a slightly better range, until I got this particular router.  We set it up at one end of the house and it reaches all points of the home, including the pool area which is another 100ft away in the opposite direction, so now I have one router that reaches the whole range of the home and pool and couldn't be more pleased about it.  The signal strength obviously varies depending on where you are, but it works very well overall.  This should easily cover your whole home.","rating":5},{"comment":"I bought this to replace a very buggy Hawking HD45R router. I was sick of dealing with problems and decided to go all out.After reading rave reviews about wireless range, some even saying they get signal for an entire block, I was sold.  This isn't the case for me, however.. nowhere near.  Signal is no better, possibly a bit worse than my less-than-impressive Hawking.  I have a medium sized three-bedroom one story house.  My router is situated on the eastern-most side.  By the time I get to the backyard patio, right in the middle of the house (~40 feet away as the crow flies), my signal strength is at half, and I pull in about 7\/2mbps out of my 50\/25mbps FiOS connection.  And it stays that way if I walk all the way to the other end of the house.  Not what I was expecting.  It seems there is a pretty steep fall-off in signal strength after leaving the room, more so than with my Hawking, which was placed in exactly the same location.Here are some very non-scientific signal readings I've taken across the house:Within 5 feet of the router: -22 dBm~15 feet away: -40 dBm~30 feet away: -50 dBmBackyard ~40 feet: -65 dBm (through brick)~60 feet away: -70 dBmFor reference, I pick up my neighbor's Wifi at around -75 dBm, that's going through two houses and about 100 feet distance.That's not a deal-breaker though, because it's good enough for my needs.  Where the router lacks in signal strength, it makes up for it in the firmware.  I am completely floored by the quality and options available in the firmware.  It's fast, very good looking and packed with features.  All of the UI components refresh automatically in front of your eyes without having to reload a page.  New computer jumps on the network?  It appears instantly in front of you.  Click it and you can give it a name, view its IP, give it a dedicated IP, or apply parental controls.  Need to forward ports?  Add a bunch on the same screen and It doesn't even need a reboot to take effect.  It even has a feature that lets you shut off the router's activity lights so they don't bother you at night.  How cool is that?  There is just so much to be said about it.  I couldn't be more pleased.It's big.  It's metal.  It's heavy.  It's clearly very well made.Overall, I'm very happy I decided to purchase this.  The other popular Netgear and Asus 1900AC routers out there seemed to be plagued with firmware issues that I was not prepared to deal with after coming from my buggy Hawking.If wireless signal ever happens to magically improve after a firmware update, I will happily update to 5 stars.

QoS.- Wireless bridge support built in.- Dynamic DNS support.  Not sure this works w\/ DynDNS on first test.  Will try again.- Speed.  AC, as well as B, G, and N.- Coverage and signal quality.  I'm getting great coverage. This is beating two older Linksys wifi routers, a 2-year old netgear.Dislikes:- No major issues so far.Performance:Throughput:  The newest device I have only does 802.11N WiFi, but I can easily get a 144 Mbps link anywhere in my house.  Copying files from another server over WiFi confirmed I can see 80Mbps throughput (which is about right considering the protocol overhead and server performance).  This is an improvement over my last router, which struggled to get a full-strength N connection up stairs.Coverage:  I will upload a screenshot from my Wifi Analyzer.  This thing's signal strength is much higher than my older Linksys routers.  Kudos.Verdict: Highly recommended.I will update this review as I spend more time with this device.","rating":5},{"comment":"I was having terrible issues with my internet connection. I first thought it was my modem. That was part of the problem. I am with Time Warner and it always had to be rebooted. Plus, with the rental charge, I went ahead and bought my own,ARRIS \/ Motorola SurfBoard SB6141 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem - Retail Packaging - White. I then noticed my router, it was a Meadialink, was having huge issues. In comes this modem.Unpacking it, it is a gorgeous piece of hardware! It is packed really well! I did notice an electrical smell on my unit but have read a few people had that. Since smelling it I have not have it overheat or the smell worsen.Setting it up was a piece of cake! I loaded the software and reset the SSIDs and passwords. I never use the ones that come written on the device; I like to have my own.Range wise, this is the best router I have used. Unfortunately my router is located in the back of my house, in the bedroom. My kitchen is in the front other side. I have never been able to get a good signal in my kitchen, ever. Since installing this router, not only do I get a signal, it does not drop out. That is nice.Even though the signal is a lot stronger, I am having conflicts with the 2.4 and 5 GHz. As I write this, I have 12 devices connect and 2 are on the 5.GHz. I have a device near the router that connects at 2.4 and it has a lot of buffering issues. I have tried to change the broadcast channel but that has not solved the issue. I have tried to disable a band, which has not helped either. I never had a problem with that device until I hooked up this router. However, the connections that I was not able to get before more than make up for it.I keep this in my bedroom at a decent height. Before, the other router lights would keep me up. It was like an airport runway. I love the lights on this, it is very light and I believe you can adjust the brightness on them. The slightest light when I sleep wakes me up, I am not able to notice this at all.Very impressed with this and am going to give it a solid 4 stars.","rating":4},{"comment":"I upgraded to the WRT1900AC from a Linksys E4200, a Wi-Fi N router that was state-of-the-art when it was introduced in 2011. The E4200 was a great router--and that's why I combined it with the WRT1900AC to extend my wireless *and* my wired network. Here's how.I needed really good, high-speed connections for a few devices located far away from my router--a television, a TiVo, and a Blu-ray player, and Wi-Fi didn't work very well with these devices. So, I set up the WRT1900AC, and then I set up the old E4200 in bridge mode. (See http:\/\/kb.linksys.com\/Linksys\/GetArticle.aspx?docid=28cee6a2fb0d4176a2210942d1d5836c_Setting_up_the_Linksys_E4200_in_bridge_mode.xml for instructions). I strung Ethernet cables under the house, installing jacks behind the television, and then connected the E4200 below it.The WRT1900AC has only four gigabit Ethernet ports, but configuring the E4200 as a bridge gave me three additional Ethernet ports in that remote location, and it gave me a strong Wi-Fi N signal in that part of the house. If you decide to do this too, make sure you connect an Ethernet cable from one of the WRT1900AC's Ethernet ports to an Ethernet port--not the WAN port--on the secondary router; otherwise, the Ethernet ports won't work with other devices. I also configured both routers to use the same SSID, so that devices would move from one router's signal to another as the devices moved around the house; the trick was to configure the routers to use different Wi-Fi channels--ones that don't overlap.Wireless coverage with the WRT1900AC is certainly much better than with the E4200 in my house, I assume because the WRT1900AC has those four external antenna, and the E4200 has none. Still, it isn't good enough to cover my entire house, which is pretty modestly sized, but which has plaster walls, some knob-and-tube wiring, and other things that interfere with wireless signals. I would like to investigate swapping out the WRT1900AC's external antenna for larger\/longer ones, but I'm waiting for Linksys to introduce some.The WRT1900AC has flaked out on me a couple of times, though. Twice in the first month all of its settings have been wiped out, requiring me to set the thing up all over again. It hasn't happened in a more than a week, but now I back up the configuration every time I change something, so that, if it happens again, I can easily restore the settings. (Look under Troubleshooting&#62;Diagnostics&#62;Router configuration to back up or restore your configuration).I like the new Network Map, which shows you all of your devices and their status. I like that it lets you edit the devices' names and customize their pictures, and that you can make DHCP reservations from this map. However, the list isn't always up to date, and it's often missing devices that are obviously connected. I've had this same problem with the E4200 and the Linksys WRT64GS that I had before it. Also, the Network Map page has an &#34;Internet usage&#34; report, which, obviously, is supposed to show you how much bandwidth devices in the map are using, but it's pretty useless, because it shows you only current, live usage, and only Internet usage. You can't see usage over time, and you can't see local network usage. Seeing as the router uses &#34;open&#34; firmware, it might be nice if someone would make this more useful.I still have mainly Wi-Fi N devices, so I couldn't test Wi-Fi AC yet (and I'm sure others are doing that). But I did test Ethernet performance, thinking that perhaps the CPU and RAM that Linksys tout might have a positive effect on wired performance. Before I set up the WRT1900AC, I read and wrote 10.6GB of folders and files from a NAS connected via Ethernet to the E4200 router to a computer that was also connected via Ethernet. I also performed the same tests to a laptop connected via 5GHz Wi-Fi N. After I set up the WRT1900AC, I ran all the tests again, and in all cases, the times were almost the same--and certainly within any margin of error. So, if my tests are any indication, any performance boost you might expect will come only with Wi-Fi AC.I admire Linksys's attempt to pull out all the stops with this product; it really is ambitious. But I'm looking forward to a few more firmware updates, which will hopefully make it realize its full potential.","rating":4},{"comment":"The setup was easy.  The range is amazing.  I get great signal everywhere throughout my tri-level condo.  All my devces connect without a problem and tests on all of the wireless devices showed that they were geting the speed promised by my cable company.I am not using all of the extra features, so, considering the price, this modem is an overkill for my needs.  Also, the look of the modem is anything but subtle.  My previous Linksys e4200 was much more subtl in appearance and fit fine into the living room decor.  This alien-looking modem, I hide in the entertainment center.","rating":4},{"comment":"This WiFi router is a beast!  It is beautifully presented in a foam padded box and then you see the size and how it is ruggedly constructed.  It is not small by all means, but maybe this is why it gives off such a strong WiFi signal.I work in a one story brick building that only has Ethernet connection for our company's network.  I was so pleased when the big boss allowed me to hook up the Linksys WRT1900AC Smart WiFi Router.  The setup took me less than 10 minutes and it was done all on my iPad Air.  All you need to do is install the four antennas, plug in the power plug, connect the Linksys WiFi router to your existing modem using the included Ethernet cable and then connect to the internet wirelessly using the username and password that is written in the instructions.  Once you are connected you can then go through the process of changing the WiFi router's name and password and setting up your preferences.Even though there are many twist, turns and brick walls throughout the building, the signal is incredibly strong.  I setup a Smart WiFi Account where I can monitor and control my network anywhere from my smartphone or iPad.  I can even attach an external storage device and access the files.  There are some other cool features such as parental controls and checking to see how your network's speed is performing to name a couple.  Keep in mind the account username and password for the Smart WiFi account is different than the router's.The only negative feature I do not like is that the guest account has to have a password.  I prefer using no password for guest accounts and just limiting their access.Everyone at work now loves me because they can now use their smartphones all day long without using their data on their cellular service plans.  Yeah!","rating":4},{"comment":"There's something awe inspiring about any router that has so many antennas - and the WRT1900AC did not disappoint.This router launched to very high expectations. It was to be the modern-day successor to its hall-of-fame older sibling - the WRT54GL - which I reviewed here years ago :)Coming almost a year after Belkin's purchase of the Linksys brand, there was also a lot of anticipation (mine included) as to the future of a venerable brand (remember the ill-fated merger of Chrysler and Mercedes?). After a singularly bad experience with a previous Belkin router, I had personally chosen to stay away - well, until this one.I recently had a chance to get familiar with Fluke Network's AirCheck wifi tester, which has a uniquely useful Survey feature that works great for testing routers. I used this to get a baseline from my WNDR4700, and compared it with the results after switching to the Linksys.My findings?Setup was painless - I unhooked my Netgear WNDR4700; moved its Ethernet cables over to the WRT1900AC; rebooted my cable modem; and powered up the new router. I connected via the Ethernet port to the WRT1900AC, configured my wireless networks to their original settings, and I was done. Yes - it took about 10 minutes, and most of that was spent fishing a cable that I managed to drop in the most inaccessible area behind my office desk.The WRT1900AC also provides a smashing device network map that is a spectacular improvement over the anemic options previous routers sported, and its user interface has also been greatly streamlined.It also performed far better, or even more important - more consistently, than the older WNDR4700 that it replaced - in both the 2.4 and 5-GHz bands.AirCheck's Survey mode provides heatmap-like graphical views of signal strength (dbM) and throughput (Mbps) across both frequency bands. After a long weekend where I painstakingly drew up an architectural map of two floors, I was ready to go. For both routers, I measured signal strength and throughput in common usage areas (such as my entertainment center, my favorite couch, etc.) In both bands, the Linksys comfortably bested my older WNDR4700. Visually this appears as a single tone color across most of the floor for the Linksys, whereas it is a patchwork quilt for the WNDR (I have a few known dead zones that I've patched using a wireless access point.)As for reliability, so far it has been stable and I have not had any noticeable reboots or disconnects.This router does get fairly hot - despite its well ventilated case and internal fan. But then, this router has a processor that is about as powerful as my desktop tower from the mid 90s :)Note that I do not intend to use OpenWRT\/Tomato\/etc. so I cannot speak to that controversy.Happy Networking!~A_E~Setup Tips:1. Use WPA2 encryption, with a password that is at least 8 characters long (12 preferred)2. Turn off UPnP and WPS unless you explicitly need them (there are security issues associated with both.)3. Change the router's admin password right away (the default is \"admin\")4. The DHCP server is configured to start at 192.168.1.100. I changed this to the traditional range as I have memorized the reserved addresses for a number of devices.","rating":5},{"comment":"6\/17\/2014 First off, this thing is physically huge compared to my old wi-fi router. I've read it gets hot, but I never noticed any heat issue in the first couple hours of use. Installation was fairly straight forward, but I will say the printed &#34;quick instructions&#34; aren't the best. They are designed for wi-fi setup, and I used a LAN connection, and the oversight is noticeable in the missing steps (I hate when instructions are vague - I want them to be &#34;click here&#34;, but a few of the comments were  &#34;and now do this&#34; without saying how to do that).I didn't use the accompanied CD that came with the router, so maybe it's instructions are clearer, but once my PC saw the router, the web page opened up by itself and I was off installing before I thought about it.The connected device display is a little &#34;hokey&#34;. Oh sure, pictures in a spoke layout look cool to the touchy feely icon crowd, but I prefer a solid list of &#34;here are the LAN devices you have connected&#34; and &#34;here are the wireless devices you have connected&#34;. Simple and concise so I can look at MAC addresses, assigned IP and descriptions - but that is my personal preference. All my devices were listed. Speeds were good, but not a huge improvement so the limiting factor is my provider. Will update this post if things change, but after 3 days it has been working well.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Linksys WRT1900AC Dual Band Smart Wi-Fi Wireless AC Router is both a very full featured 802.11n and 802.11ac wireless router, employing the full range of current standards, and also a bold retro design statement that uses all the styling cues of the \"classic\" Linksys routers of many years ago. All router makers are held prisoner to the standards bodies that set specs for various functions, which are then picked and incorporated immediately by chip makers that supply many of the components used by all router makers. So distinguishing a product or brand name is getting harder and harder as standards become ever sophisticated and ever more generic to all models and brands. All that said, it's obvious that Linksys really put some design effort into making this a cutting edge wireless router. Design really does count for lot, and Linksys has a winner with this effort.I have had the opportunity to try a wide range of wireless routers over the past couple of years.  The Linksys WRT1900AC is completely competent in all its functions, and does everything possible to push the envelope on its feature set. If other routers offer USB 2.0 ports then the Linksys WRT1900AC has USB 3.0 + a eSATA port. If other routers have three antennas or an internal antenna then the Linksys WRT1900AC boldly uses a new four antenna design. And so forth.None of this is a gimmick. These features really do contribute to the solid usability of the router. I'm not in a position to scientifically measure the effect of the four antenna layout, and the technology that Linksys claims is used to enhance range and wall penetration, but in using the router I have to say it really did cover every corner of my house, even some places that in the past seemed to be a bit weak. The USB 3.0 port did seem to provide zippier network transfers of files stored on a USB 3.0 external common drive for the system.I don't know what the processor speed of my old TP-LINK router was, but the advertised dual core 1.2mhz processor on the Linksys WRT1900AC can't but help in speeding the operation of the system, especially if you have a big family or are using it in a workplace with many many users accessing the system at once. I never use setup wizards for routers. So I can't comment on the one that came with the WRT1900AC. But setup via the manual browser based interface could not have been easier, with well laid out menus and a clean look and flow to setting all the various features and security levels.The use of OpenWRT as the basis for the router software should allow for ongoing development and enhancement of the system.The WRT1900AC did not call attention to itself in a bad way, and looked great. If that sounds just a but unfocused -- where are the head to head stats of micro difference and testing of nano incremental strengths and weaknesses? - then it's because wireless routers have become pretty much like microwave ovens and DVD players. There are differences, but they come down mostly to styling and control layouts, design, and perhaps user pride of ownership if the product has managed to create a mystique about its brand.About the styling: this is a real \"guy\" looking device. After years of trying to make routers look like piano gloss plastic pillows, bars of soap, little wi-fi handbags, and all kinds of other styling exercises that tried to re-imagine a router as a innocuous device snoring away on a shelf and not clashing with the wife's or girlfriend's decor, the Linksys WRT1900AC takes a bold back to the future approach and uses the black and blue colors, case shape and antenna look of the \"classic\" Linksys routers of old like the Linksys WRT54G. The shape of the case brings to mind the Batmobile, not an over sized birth control pill case. Personally, I love the look and think it's playful and fun.I am happy with my Linksys WRT1900AC. RECOMMENDED.","rating":5},{"comment":"It was said this Linksys WRT1900AC was not only the biggest on the market, but the fastest and he most expensive. I am always on the look out for bigger and better technology, especially when it comes to the newest computer category. So when I saw this router being offered I jumped at the chance, although my current Wireless Router works just fine and allows everything I need. However, this being considered \"The Best\" on the market, I wanted it.Once I received my order I opened it immediately and I will say, it is a pretty large Router, placed in a really cool box with all of the accessories neatly stacked in the box making this appear like the manufacturer took a lot of effort to make sure you as the buyer was impressed. After all, first impressions are everything.I removed my current Router, loaded up the included CD-Rom included with this Router and went to installing it on my Desktop. Now I feel I should describe my desktop to some extent. I am running Window7Pro 64-bit with a Core I-7 processing chip, 32gb of Ram, twin 2TB Hard Drives, a Corsair HX Professional Series 850-Watt 80 Plus Certified Power Supply and a ASUS GT640 2GB DDR3 Memory Graphics Cards.Once I proceeded with installation, it was very easy and performed much of it by itself. That was the initial installation part. Then came the secondary installation where you can set it up to meet your needs and requirements. As soon as I finished and saved my settings (all of which are offered as options on the setup screen) it took a major dive. It died and even after 1.5hrs with Linksys Support, it was still dead. Trying to call Linksys was not an easy task, because the first number that was actually included with the Router was not in service, so I looked them up and tried several other numbers. I eventually found a support person to speak with, but during my first conversation I was told I would have to give them my credit card number and authorize a $279.00 plus related shipping and tax charges once any service was performed on this router. I first called them because at first I thought I may have installed it incorrectly and thought if that was the case, they would be able to talk me through it.I must add that prior to buying anything, especially online, I first read NOT manufacturers reviews, but reviews written by consumers that actual own the product I am interested in. Next to the product itself, Customer Service is equal to it in importance, because once someone gets your money and should you experience a problem, that is when the full truth will show through. And in this case, I'm sorry but Linksys failed my grade with a \"F\" in Customer Service. First, it took over an hour to get a hold of them after being bounced around from extension to extension, then I did get a very helpful representative that tried his best to help and eventually said the product was defective. In the end, I was told in order to have the product serviced, I would have to authorized a charge of $279.00 plus tax & shipping if I wanted it repaired. And then he said would replace the unit with a Refurbished unit, not a new one. I told him I wasn't concerned about replacement, but wanted to try Linksys Customer Service because that is part of a buying process in the event someone experienced a defective unit. I asked him that if I had asked for a replacement, why would it not be a NEW unit since this unit was in fact new and just recently released for sale to customers. He informed me that they had hundreds of units that had been returned due to being defective and replacing Defective units were replaced with Refurbished not new units.My responsibility as a Reviewer, is to offer a truthful, fair, non-biased opinion of products offered to me. Although this product was the first ever I had received defective, if I had ordered this directly from the company and received it defective, my review would include any positive or negative issues I experienced from the sellers Customer Service department, as I firmly believe the possibility of an occasional product being received defective is part of the Sales process and how the manufacturer remedies the situation is an integral part of the sales process.","rating":1},{"comment":"I have replaced my Sonicwall TZ100 with this and it has worked leaps and bounds better.  I am no notice at networking, but Im not an active professional either.  Setting up a wireless network (2.4 and 5ghz), a guest wireless network (chose only to give 2.4) and my wired network - all took me about 45 minutes.  Very easy starting with by logging in with the pre-configured wireless SSID and password.I plugged a 3TB external hdd into a USB port.  Again, setup was super easy and just plain worked.  When I plugged a 5 bay port multiplier into the eSATA port only one drive appeared.  I can't say if port multipliers are supported or not - I just tried the plug it in and see if worked method.  I will have to investigate further on this feature.We had been having problems with the Sonicwall being flaky - dropped connections and being slow.  Since moving to the Linksys we have seen an increase in both speed and reliability.  Time will tell if that keeps up, but so far I have been very impressed.If I had a gripe it is the size.  Physically it is much larger that the sonicwall.Another limitation I have found is in creating vlans.  The Sonicwall would allow me to configure individual ports to act as vlans.  I haven't figured out how to accomplish this same feature on the Linksys. The area that allows for vlans seems to be for ISPs that support that function, not creating internal vlans.Overall:Simple to set up.Reliable.I would highly recommend this router to another small business owner.","rating":5},{"comment":"I received my WRT1900AC and connected all the cables. The set-up took 10 to 15 minutes & I was pleasantly surprised with the increased speed and range of the router. The graphic interface let me see my network by logging into the router.

Finally a router that lets me take advantage of my high speed internet bandwidth!!","rating":5},{"comment":"I've been using a trusty Airport Extreme router for about 7 years now.  While it still works great, its starting to get outdated, so I was really excited to try out the Linksys WRT 1900AC.Years ago Linksys was a solid brand, but they had a few years of mediocre routers.  Thankfully the 1900AC takes them back to the solid brand I remember them being.Packaging:The Linksys comes packaged in a very well-cushioned box, which is constructed well enough to easily be re-usabe if you plan on moving in the future.  Included is the router, the four antennae, a disk with instructions + short printed quick-start guide, the power cable, and an ethernet cable.Setup:Setup was a breeze.  I've messed around with all sorts of routers and this was probably the easiest set up (for a basic home network) that I've ever done - it was quicker and simpler than even apple's Airpot Extreme, which is saying a lot.Menus:The menus of a router can run the gamut from information heavy and confusing to simplistic and bare.  The Linksys strikes a great balance between information, usability, and features.  For the average home user it will provide everything you need and more in a simple and intuitive user interface.  For me this is a big deal, because I don't think I've ever used the word 'intuitive' in conjunction with a router's menu.  That said, power users may be disappointed if used to something like DD-WRT.Performance:Performance is excellent.  I noticed an immediate improvement over my old Airport Extreme.  Dual-band is great as I can have an older device (such as my PS3) using the 2.4GHz band, while migrating most of my newer devices to the 5GHz.  The range is also great in my house, though my house is on the smaller side and the walls don't block signals too badly.  That said, I would expect more than adequate coverage in most homes.Advanced Features:I haven't tried hooking any backup solutions\/drives up to this yet, though the menu makes it extremely simple to do so.  Once I do I'll update my review accordingly.  I have read elsewhere that the router does a great job with this, though.Overall:The Linksys WRT 1900AC gives you a great performing, advanced, high-end router with an intuitive and easy to understand interface.  Setup is a breeze and it should offer easy options for hooking up external backup drives.  Even the packaging is high-end.  However this all comes at a cost as this is one of the most expensive home routers on the market.  That said, when I bought my airport 7 years ago it was also very expensive and ended up being well-worth the money.  If this Linksys also manages to last for years  (and I see no reason why it wouldn't) then it would be, in my mind, a definite no-brainer purchase.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is definitely an AC router and it works just fine, BUT when it will really shine is when it gets support for the 3rd party firmware.I would suggest holding off on this for a little bit, because not only is it not compatible, but it is the most expensive, and price may come down over the next few months since it isn't quite a hit yet.The stock firmware on this is honestly not impressive at all and a bit uninteresting to me.  I bought it for its Open Source friendliness.  And I do think they will work great together, but it just isn't yet.  There are some beta build's I've seen but it isn't ready for prime time yet.Pros:-Looks great, I can see the roots from the old WRT54G and I like it-Build quality feels very good and it feels solid- I like having a fan that will kick on if needed, mine though has not needed to yet.-Great specs for Open WRT\/ DD-WRT support down the road-This can be mounted on a wall or ceiling if needed, unlike a few of the other AC Routers out there.Cons:-Not supported by DD-WRT or OPEN-WRT as of 6\/17\/14-Stock firmware is lacking a bit even if they expect folks to use 3rd party, they could have put a little more effort into it.- I'm not a huge fan of the power brick design.I will update once it is supported, and am expecting to push it up a bit in ratings, but new adopters beware.","rating":3},{"comment":"I was very excited to try this router out as a replacement to an under-performing cisco router. I had been previously using a E4200v2 from Cisco\/Linksys with mediocre wifi results the last couple of years. I live in a densely populated community with many other wifi nodes around me from my neighbors. I think this tended to cause wifi signal interference. My signal was never strong even when in the same room with the E4200. The typically wifi speed to my iphone\/laptop always sat around 30-40mbps on average. With my highest ever score of 52mbps and frequently dipping down into the single digits on bad days. I knew the E4200 was capable of more, but the interference here (even with a dual band router) made it impossible to get great reception.When I first saw the WRT1900AC I loved the fact it was a throw back to their classic blue Linksys WRT 54G (which I owned back in the day too). Moreover, I realized all these externalized antennas will likely help me get better reception.I knew going into this router that it was built around open source, but the chipset OEM is not responding quickly for creating the drivers necessary for the open source crowd to do their thing with this device. Open source firmware is on hold until then. I likely will switch to DD-WRT firmware as soon as it is made available down the road. However, I also knew the stock firmware on a router this nice would likely have \"most\" of what I need in the settings to hold me over. Turning off SSID broadcast, Mac address filtering, various encrypt options, port forwarding, dmz, static IP assignment tables, etc... these are commonly the things I go to first on new router setups and these are all present in current firmware.As soon as I got this router up and running I did a LAN line (non wifi) speed test to see if I got any gains just by way of the higher end internal processor (in case I was bottle-necking on the previous unit). I honestly didn't expect to see any gains on my LAN line performance... I was just being diligent. My previous best speed on LAN line were around 96mbps. The first several tests right out of the box... ALL tested higher than all my previous best scores. I topped out around 124mbps... which is higher than my ISP speed I pay for, but my previous router likely wasn't able to handle those speeds. I was immediately happy with the 1900AC! Real world long duration downloads I am seeing 14-15MBps which is better than I ever did previously!I moved on to WiFi testing hoping for good things after seeing the amazing LAN speed increases. The first test right out the box was the best WiFi speed I got on any device ever to date... anywhere. Remember I said I averaged 30-40mbps on wifi with a best of 52 on my previous cisco router? Well, the first test on the 1900AC was - 92mbps, second test - 88, third test - 94. I have been testing this wifi speed on my iphone for a week now at various times of time since that point. I average low 90's and lowest test I had so far was an 82. This is literally double my average speed in the past and nearly double my best speeds. I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER! :D I finally have good wifi speed in my home. I didn't think it was possible here with all the neighbor interference. I even get great speed at all locations of my apartment even behind a concrete walled area. The strength of the signal is amazing.Some other things that I am not currently using that should be mentioned are the usb\/esata ports for external drives. From the tests reviews I have read online, the network drive performance rivals some of the better dedicated units on the market out there right now. This thing is a performer all the way around. The antennas can all be removed and replaced (if you want to upgrade them... I don't see need in doing there where I live, but options are nice). The light indicators on the front are very handy for seeing which band of wifi is being used and which LAN port is currently being used. It should be noted that this unit get very warm with all the processing power it wields. It has an internal cooling fan that turns on if the unit gets hot enough. I have not heard it turn on yet, so I am sure the heat level has to be much higher. It is important that you do not put anything ontop of the air vents of this unit with as warm as it gets. I have it sitting on high shelf with space around the sides and top to keep air circulating.Overall, I love this router. It delivered in literally every single way I wanted. It's faster and more capable in every way than my previous router. The only thing left is that the chip set manufacturer motivates and gets our open source community the drivers they need to put out their firmware. It's the final piece of this puzzle. I am keeping the faith that they will deliver eventually. This was not a deal breaker for me, especially since I got the huge performance leap I was looking for. I have enough tweaks in the stock firmware to hold me over until I can get DD-WRT. The price point is high on this router to be sure, but you know the old adage you get what you pay for, in this case it does apply.If you want one of the best router on the market right now... this is the one. I HIGHLY recommend it!","rating":5},{"comment":"Never had as much directional control with WiFi antennas before, these four seem to be much more useful than the old dual units on our old Linksys WRT54GS.  Seems to allow not only more range in a lateral driection, but also more boost in vertical to the second floor.  A welcomed increase for sure.Some pretty impressive features added now, but only if and when you have a need for them.  Good point is that it is still a solid router even working at it's most basic form.  I can make use of new features as the need arises and not worry about an upgrade to the hardware anytime soon.Initial setup wasn't any more complicated than the old WRT54GS was, but when you don't have to mess with your router for a long time you forget what it takes to get them in operation.  More fear of gettting started than anything, simple, clear instructions get you going and if you pull out your old settings you wrote down you can jump right to filling in the info required.It is half again larger and heavier than the WRT54GS it replaced, but that doesn't really cause any problems unless the old spot blocks air movement... if so, might have to change locations or even hang it on the wall using the handy mounting holes.This model does have a built in fan like they all should have.Nice Linksys modern\/retro look with the same color combo of past years with a new shape on the front.Now for the test of time... hope it does as well as the old one has done for many years.","rating":4},{"comment":"Wow. I guess I should have updated my Linksys router a long, long time ago. My old router, which was admittedly a bottom of the line model, was getting where it couldn't handle multiple computers and smart TVs without dying on me. It also meant that every time we set up a new device we were using some 32 digit password to do it. I got this new Linksys router in the mail from Amazon, and honestly I have been dreading setting it up. We have 4 laptops, 4 smart TVs, a Wii, smart phones, etc... I was NOT looking forward to trying to get all of those devices connected to a new router. Fortunately, this router did everything for me.Let me say off the bat that I'm only moderately competent in the &#34;setting up computers and networks&#34; area. The directions for setting up the new router were incredibly simple. Plug it into the power. Plug in the network cable from the modem. Log into the wireless network with the password provided. Open the browser and the instructions are on the screen. It worked great. It was super, super easy. One suggestion: Don't name your new network the same thing as your old network without deleting your old network name first! We couldn't figure out why it wasn't working for us until I realized, I need to delete the old network name. Then  everything worked fine.And it's SO fast. I mean, what a joy. I can't believe we suffered so long with the old router. It has an automatic guest network as well so you can give your teenager's visiting friends a password that you can change after they leave. Anyway, completely pleased with this router and I have not even touched on all it can do!","rating":5},{"comment":"If you don't know why this router looks the way it does, then you probably shouldn't be buying it.  The design is a very clear throwback to the amazing WRT series of routers back from the 90's.  Those are the things that brought wireless into the mainstream, and the reason Linksys developed such a strong brand.  I'd honestly buy this router just for the throwback design.  However, on top of that, it also brings Linksys firmly back to the very top spot on the router market.  Over the years as other brands caught up and Linksys even went down a bit, its nice to see such a high-performance product released.  This router will reach corners of your house that other routers wouldn't even get close to.  It will go through thick walls, past appliances, and probably even into the neighbors house (so make sure to set a good password).It does all this with the latest wireless standards, and using a firmware that is highly open and customize.  Honestly, I cannot say enough good things about this router.  For a consumer grade router, this is easily the best available, by a long shot.  Thanks so much to Linksys for not only giving us this amazing retro design, but also returning the Linksys brand to the number 1 spot for home routers.  I'd give this 6 out of 5 stars if I could.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have had this router for only a few days now and works great.

I finally have whole-house wireless coverage after many months of trying various solutions (3 different routers, plus a WiFi range extender). This pricey but top-quality router has doubled the signal strength that I got with either of my previous routers, and the so-called WiFi range extender (TP-LINK TL-WPA4220KIT Universal Wi-Fi Range Extender, AV500 Powerline Edition) did not help at all.I paid almost $200 for my previous router, an ASUS RT-AC66U Dual-Band Wireless that I just replaced with this Linksys. The ASUS was OK, improved the signal slightly over what I got with my previous router that was provided by Qwest\/CenturyLink. But I still had dead spots (our home is 2 stories, 4,000 sq. ft.). I thought I'd just have to accept that my house couldn't get signal coverage in every room.But the Linksys WRT1900AC (highly rated by CNET) claims to be engineered for multi-story structures, so I thought it was worth a shot. And it works!The antennas are not high-gain (they're non-directional), so Linksys recommends you position them vertically, all straight up and down. That seems to work best for me, too. The ASUS router claimed directional capability, and I did get better results by pointing the antennas toward rooms where I encountered the weakest signal.When I say the Linksys doubled the coverage I got before, I mean that in the two distant rooms that used to get only 1 or 2 bars of signal strength, they now get 4 bars. So I can't verify that the signal reaches twice as far, but I definitely get twice the signal strength.Pros: Best signal coverage I've found yet. Easier to set up than any other router I've tried, and it takes you to the best online &#34;dashboard&#34; management website I've yet seen for home networks. Clean, easy to understand, quick to set up.Cons: more expensive and a bit larger than most routers. But after what I've been through, the Linksys WRT1900AC is well worth the price.","rating":5},{"comment":"Bought this to replace an Apple Airport Extreme Router.  This looks impressive, big antennas and all.  But performance wise, it's really lacking.  Router is downstairs in my basement.  Upstairs the signal quality is poor compared to the Apple.  I'm testing it now as a Wireless AC Bridge (an expensive one), but see no performance gain at all compared to the Wireless N Bridge it's currently taking the place of (D-Link 1522).  At 5 times the price of the D-Link, it's not even worth keeping as a bridge.I really wanted to like this router, but am seeing no benefit at all to keeping it.","rating":2},{"comment":"Our family has very high demands for a wireless gateway. We have over 20 wireless devices in the house, as well as a dozen ethernet devices, frequently engage in heavy downloading and streaming, and run several servers. So, a challenging network environment that requires a router capable of heavy lifting. There market for high-end non-business class routers is fairly small, and I was excited to hear about the reborn Linksys, especially with the rather substantial hardware specs this unit offers.The hardware is as advertised - beefy and powerful - but sadly, it is married to a buggy, limited, built-in firmware that offers very limited functionality, crashes frequently, and sadly fails to take advantage of all the power the fast CPU and expansive memory in the device could offer. During set-up, I found that the router's firmware frequently crashed when doing basic operations such as adding a DHCP reservation for a network device, or when navigating around the (overly fancy but not very useful) network map.The firmware is also short of the kinds of advanced features I expect to find in a router of this class. There's no support for VPN (either outbound, i.e. connecting your entire network to a VPN server, or inbound, i.e. a built-in OpenVPN server). There is a media prioritization option, but it is very basic and doesn't allow for advanced settings. Other semi-advanced tasks like setting up pinholes and port triggers is very limited and is missing UI basics like a list of attached devices and their IPs to quickly select from (unless you use the super-buggy network map).I am not sure in what world the product management for this devices decided to spend time on things like that network map, or the worthless built-in speed test, and not on things like VPN support or a more robust UI. Even the Linksys remote management was buggy - and requires the use of a proprietary app - you can't enable remote web-based UI access.The good news is that all this firmware awfulness can in theory be addressed - it's just software and bugs can be fixed and features added. The base, the solid hardware - is real. Wireless performance is excellent - not magic, but very reliable, and I found the beamforming has a small, but noticeable effect especially vertically. One wireless quirk I found (hopefully just a bug that can be squashed) is that although the device claims to support WPA1 personal, when I tried connecting a Nintendo Wii, which only support WPA1 and not WPA2, it would not connect. A bit of investigation showed that although the gateway says that is supports WPA\/WPA2 mode, it wasn't properly allowing WPA only devices onto the 2.4 ghz WLAN.I will grade this Linksys as &#34;incomplete&#34; - the hardware is ready, and if Linksys can update the firmware, they may have a winner.","rating":3},{"comment":"setup was  breeze.  i just returned my nighthawk r7000 due to problems with the slow speed.  i can only say that this device is so much better as i have not seen any buffering or dropping connection issues. why i mention buffering because when i use chromecast from my laptop to view movie on tv, then i observed slowness with r700 but this device has not given me any slownessui is impressive and gives you wholistic view of whats going on with your devices and network. so far excellent","rating":5},{"comment":"Purchased this unit to rreplace a \"failed\" LinkSys WRT610N,v2; it just \"died\" after 5 or 6 years.

Since I was replacing an earlier version, just removed the etheernet cables from the previous unit and connected to my new unit.  The included DVD walked me thru the basics and links to LinkSys for establishing network names and protection.Wi-fi performance:  We live in a ~ 2000 sq.ft. stucco home designed in an \"L-shape\" with stucco walls.  Although the stucco blends well with our Coastal CA location, stucco is applied  over a \"grid\" including meshed wire support -- effectively degrading r-f transmission through the walls.  This necessitated our use of a \"signal booster\" with the previous unit.  Unplugged these units (which automagically worked with the new system) and still had full-strength reception to iPad3 & iPhone5 throughout the home and even on the boat dock!  GREAT!Security:  WPA2 -- quick and easy.Factory telephone support:  There is a special help-line for the WRT1900AC -- called it and after a wait of LESS THAN ONE MINUTE, talked with a support person who led me thru changing newtwork names and reapplying ecurity.

For one, the WiFi reception was not as strong at the outer parts of my home, and if I were to venture outdoors to my back yard I could totally not use it. So I was definitely in market for a better and more powerful home router. This new Linksys router more than satisfied all of my home networking needs, and it has managed to lay to rest all of my networking concerns for years to come.Of all electronic devices that I own and use on a regular basis, the ones that rely on tricky networking setup in order to function are the ones that I usually have the hardest time setting up. This would include Internet routers, network serves and storage, and IP cameras. However, Linksys router was a breeze to setup. The reason for this lays in no small part in the intuitive and straightforward stand-alone setup app. Once you set up your router, though, you are able to use all the bells and whistles of the traditional router website-based power interface. If you happen to be more tech savvy, and like to tinker with settings and networking configurations, then you will be really pleased with what this router has to offer. I am not an IT professional, but the router configuration interface seemed on the level of the best professional interfaces that I had seen.One small feature that I really liked about this router is that it has a dedicated power switch on the back. I frequently need to power cycle the router, and unplugging and plugging back in the power is not the most convenient way of doing it. By having a dedicated switch power cycling has been made as convenient as it could possibly be.The wired speed boost was the most noticeable when it came to downloading large files. The download speed for several torrent files easily exceeded by a factor of five or more the top speed that I had ever achieved with my old Linksys router.The advertised range of this router was indeed on par what I had experienced. The WiFi signal was really strong throughout my house, and I was getting full five bar reception even at the far end of my yard. There was no need for signal boosters. I tried streaming an HD video to my iPad all the way across my yard, and it worked without glitches.The router comes with two USB ports &#8211; an eSATA\/USB 2.0 port and a USB 3.0 port. This allows you to connect up to two different USB peripherals at the time. (Unfortunately, no daisy-chaining is possible as far as I can tell.) The 2.0 USB port is intended for connecting a printer or an eSATA enabled device. It allows you in principle to turn one of your old printers into a networked printer. This worked, sort of. It took me a bit of tweaking before I was able to access my old HP laser printer this way form my two Macs.The USB 3.0 port is a truly great feature. I connected it to a 1 TB hard drive, and had a centralized file storage point for my whole home network. The transfer speeds were really good, thanks to the USB 3.0 and fast network connections, as well as to the fast router processor. I have an old Windows home server, which I&#8217;ve been using for a similar purpose for years, but its aging processor and relatively meager memory make it very slow at times. The high file-transfer speed is the most noticeable when streaming high definition videos across the network. I was streaming 1080p home videos to all of my networked devices without a hitch.I do wish that this router had another dedicated USB port on the front. Sometimes you want to quickly share some file with your whole network, or connect a dedicated USB device. In such situations trying to access the back of your router can be a bot of a pain.This is a very large router. It is about twice as big as my old Linksys router, which in turn was about twice the size of my first Microsoft router. It is even bigger than my old Acer netbook. You would want to make sure that you have enough space wherever you intend to position this beast.This is probably the most powerful and effective consumer-level router that I have come across. It will future-proof your home network for many years to come. I would also strongly recommend it for small businesses that have substantial data transfer and storage need. Overall, a wonderful product.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have a router that fails more often than I prefer. It resets OK and works for a few days and then fails again requiring a reset. I unplugged the router and hooked up this Linksys in its stead. I could not access the internet. The CD that came with this router is difficult to read. The information is displayed in some type of faded out bluish\/gray squares and is not legible. I suppose the problem could be my brand new Dell PC with Windows 8.1 although I have not had any other display problems.Lucky me that my son had a spare D-Link router which he gave me. I plugged it in, it works like a charm, does not fail and all is well.","rating":1},{"comment":"Ordered this with frustration free packing.  This caused a problem. This unit comes with a manual that has a unique login password for the router based on serial number. The unit I got had a manual the same model number but a different serial number. Therefor I couldn't log in to the router for setup. Most likely the swap happened at amazon since they unpack these from the factory package and place them in the &#34;frustration free&#34; package...... I called customer service and they were extremely helpful. They got me going in just a few minutes and placed a follow up call later to see if all was still ok. You might want to avoid the frustration free packaging to prevent you having to do the same.  Needless to say that the router itself is fantastic. You can see who's on your network ( network map) and you can prioritize what devices need internet bandwidth. No kid preventing me from watching Netflix anymore!","rating":5},{"comment":"Well featured router, but user interface is bordering on too simplistic, and not sure that I really want yet another device I can add apps too.When I started this up it picked the one channel that was exactly on top of the closest neighbors WiFi so they were interfering pretty badly.  I had to manually switch to a different channel.  If I run the WiFi analyzer tool on my phone it had picked the lowest rated channel.QoS was a bit difficult to figure out how I wanted to set it up properly, and it seemed to only let me assign a priority to different devices, and not a bandwidth cap per device.My XBox 360 really doesn't seem to like this router, and constantly gives me connection errors, where my previous ASUS RT-N66U was no problem (but not rated as fast as the WRT1900AC).  My XBox is in the same room as the Linksys so signal strength is no problem.  My other devices seem to have more issue with this as well, it seems like it will lose connection with my Cable modem for no apparent reason and I regularly have my phone saying the connection is unstable.Overall, it looks like a great router, and might be nice for custom firmware. However, I would recommend a cheaper unit for most users that will do as much as this one (the ASUS I mentioned is half as much) unless you really need the speed, which most users don't need more than their internet speed.  Bottom line is if my devices don't work with the router I am not going to use it.  I leave it as a neutral rating because not everyone is going to have these issues with it depending on their individual network setups.","rating":3},{"comment":"The return of the classic blue router (just bigger and with more internet features).  My older ASUS was getting long in tooth, and I wanted something a bit more up to date and secure.  As someone who isn't a networking hobbyist or looking to change the default software to open source (although this will be an option down the road), the WRT1900AC met my needs.  A bonus was the nostalgia inducing form factor, with the classic blue box scaled up.But could the 1900AC live up up to the massive reputation of its older brother?  Mostly yes.The packing was really clean and easy to open and deploy.  The instructions were relatively clear, although it is unclear why wireless set-up is the default.  I followed the instructions but they didn't seem to work on my iPad Air and Safari for whatever reason.  But plugging it into my computer and doing the set-up old school (via Firefox going the 192 IP route) immediately got results.  Note- the router comes with a CD, but like 99% of buyers I ignored it.Once the set-up program started it was very quick and easy, and the options were much easier to set and understand than my older ASUS was.  I quickly reset all the passwords and the SSIDs (ALWAYS DO THIS FIRST, NEVER EVER LEAVE THE DEFAULTS) sorry for the allcaps, but that's really critical.  The router downloaded and installed new firmware and gives you the option to have the router do so automatically at night- a nice touch.  I set-up a Linksys SmartWifi account to enable web based configuration- which allows easy guest access control and separate passwords (and a toggle to turn it off if you want), a handy feature my older ASUS lacked.Stability has been good so far, and I have not had any issues with speed or range.  While the 2.4 range is outstanding, the 5 range did not seem that much improved over my last router, which is a bit of a disappointment.So overall I am rather impressed with the big blue Linksys.  Its fast, easy to use and looks good.  The downsides were the size, cost and the wireless configuration issues with my iPad.  But those small issues aside, I like the WRT1900AC and won't be going back to my older ASUS.","rating":4},{"comment":"I Bought this router really nice features specially USB 3 I have connected my 5TB External Hard Drive and share it to my whole Network Internal & External also using it as a cloud storage.

I have 2 boys and when they are with me, there would be a noticeable performance hit prior to the Nighthawk.  I loved the Nighthawk because of the ease of setup as well -- it was by far the easiest user interface and set up of any router I had had...However, the Linksys equally rivals, if not surpasses the Nighthawk.  Again, Linksys has spent a lot of effort on their user interface so you don't have to be a network admin to get this set up...It is about the same size footprint (LARGE) as the nighthawk and frankly, I do not find it good looking at all... it wasn't like the Nighthawk belonged in MOMA -- it looks like a Stealth Bomber... but with the Bright blue retro Linksys look, this is really, um, noticeable!Bandwidth and performance is superior to even the nighthawk.  This is THE router to get if you are serious about cutting the cord and moving away from Cable TV and using internet streaming only.Before your plunk down our money on this router, though, you have to ask whether you have the ability to take full advantage of the speed and performance.  You have to bear in mind that your performance will only be as good as the link INTO your house -- and that tends to be a severe limiting factor with Time Warner (where you are essentially sharing bandwidth with your neighbors) or DSL -- which has significantly slower data rates than cable.  If you are on a low bandwidth plan, then you may want to consider upgrading to a higher tier to take advantage of the capabilities -- otherwise, you are probably just better off with a standard router.[NCJVR]","rating":5},{"comment":"The old Linksys WRT54GL running Tomato firmware was my favorite, but eventually I had to move to wireless AC and settle for childproof firmware.  As of June 2014, there is a Tomato firmware version under development for the WRT1900AC, but still very early so it could be a while before Tomato becomes available.  When this is ready, the WRT1900AC will be amazing.The existing firmware is typical Linksys style with only the most basic settings.  Even the D-Link routers with factory firmware have much more advanced settings than this.  However I give credit that this basic firmware feels quick and responsive, and nicely organized.The wireless range before complete dropout is about the same as my previous AC routers, but I get more reliable high throughput.The firmware allows you to turn off the LED indicators, which is nice if you have this in the bedroom and want to reduce the amount of LED light pollution to keep the room dark (I hope to see this carried over to the future open source firmware).","rating":5},{"comment":"I seriously considered a couple of great routers that are $50 cheaper -- I'm glad I stretched the budget.

I haven't had any issues though.","rating":5},{"comment":"First, let me start by saying that I have now tried each of the top tier routers from ASUS, Netgear, and now Linksys and out of the three, the only one worth buying at this point in time, in my opinion, is the Netgear Nighthawk. I have reviews on both the Netgear and the ASUS so if you are interested in those, please go to the associated reviews.As far as this new Linksys WRT1900AC that I have been so anxious to try out.......well umm, yeah, it's not very good at the moment. With a wired connection, it's perfectly fine, but that's not why we're buying these $200+ routers. To test the wireless speed I am using a Dell laptop with the latest Intel Wireless AC 7260 internal adapter. The distance between the router and this laptop is about 15 feet with a direct line of sight. Without getting all technical, I will put it like this. The Linksys is slower than the Nighthawk on the 5GHz band by almost 50%. That's right, with the router and laptop only 15 feet away from each other I am getting TWICE the transfer speed with the Nighthawk compared to this Linksys. On the 2.4GHz band it gets even worse. I don't know what they are thinking, but the 2.4GHz band is insanely slow, and even though I was already expecting this by reading other reviews, I wasn't prepared for how slow it was going to be.As if that wasn't bad enough, the *reach* of the wireless signals are also not as good as the Nighthawk's. I can get about 20 feet away from the Nighthawk (direct line of sight) before it even STARTS to drop in signal strength. With this Linksys, even standing right next to it, I'm only getting 90%, and by the time I'm 15-20 feet away it drops down to nearly 75-80%. After that, it starts dropping dramatically, and if there are any walls between you and the Linksys.......well, good luck.Last but not least, temperature. I now see why they chose to include a fan inside this router. The heat that comes out of this thing is insane. The Nighthawk gets pretty warm, and it actually feels cool compared to this thing. They say you can stack this router on top of other components, which may be true, but I am finding that the heat radiating from this router is actually heating up my other networking components located around it. To give you an idea of how hot it gets, I used an infrared thermometer and actually got a reading of 88C\/190F from the top left hand side of the router. The right hand side top was a bit cooler at 65C\/150F, yes, I just called 150F \"cooler\".I could go on, and on about how underwhelmed I am with this product, but the one saving grace of the whole deal which has yet to be seen is the possibility of an open source firmware fixing all of these issues. I have no doubt that this router has amazing potential and is being massively held back by the current firmware, but as of right now, there is no other firmware to try. There is also a rumor that Linksys will be making some high gain antenna available for this router, which may help the signal issues, but again, those aren't available yet.I would have given this product only 2 stars if it weren't for the fact that Linksys is being open to work with the open source community, and the only reason I would have given it 2 stars is because with a wired connection it's flawless, and although the wireless connections are terrible for performance, they at least do work.My recommendation if you are in the market for a router of this caliber is to either get a Netgear Nighthawk, or wait for someone like DD-WRT or Tomato to release a firmware that actually works before buying this router. I, personally, am going back to my Nighthawk, and will wait to try this one again until all of the bugs are worked out.........what a shame.","rating":3},{"comment":"Ive had the Linksys e3000 for the past 4 years, and now decided to improve bandwidth in my home with 14+ devices that I run simultaneously all of the time.

On getting this new Linksys WRT1900AC Router, I decided to finally replace the old Linksys router with this one.Setup: no major issues.  The router arrived with the most recent firmware already installed.  I used manual setup, messed up once requiring the router to be factory reset, then completed setup successfully the second time through.  Unfortunately (but not surprisingly) no printed manual other than a Quick Start guide is included.Size: I only bring this topic up because the WRT1900AC is big, and will take up a lot of desk space.  On the other hand it is solidly built, and the four external antennas promise improved wireless performance (more on that soon).Wireless performance: for really good analysis of wireless and routing performance check out the reviews at smallnetbuilder dot com.  But here is my quick performance test of my Linksys and Asus routers:- Both wireless routers are located in the basement on top of a cabinet.- Test computer is a Dell Latitude laptop with an Intel Ultimate-N 6300 AGN mini card on 2nd floor of house.- Asus RTN-66U 2.4 GHz signal -53 dB  (closer to -0 dB is better)- Linksys WRT1900AC 2.4 GHz signal -50 dBDuring my observation I observed the Linksys with a 1 dB to 6 dB advantage over the Asus.- Asus RTN-66U 5.0 GHz signal -65 dB- Linksys WRT1900AC 5.0 GHz signal -60 dBDuring my observation I observed the Linksys with a 3 dB to 8 dB advantage over the Asus.Wireless performance wise the Linksys is the clear winner.Stability\/bugs: had to do a factory reset during setup as noted above.  Otherwise no issues so far.Firmware: The WRT1900AC is designed to support third-party firmware like DD-WRT or Tomato.  However as of June 2014 it seems like third party firmware alternatives are still in development and\/or not mature.  For now I am sticking with OEM firmware.Now I have not been able to check out all the features of this router, in particular its wireless-AC performance or its ability to support an attached USB drive.  But in my early experience with the Linksys WRT1900AC I am quite impressed with it.","rating":5},{"comment":"I was one of the very first buyers of the old WRT54G, the classic router from Linksys. After many routers, the three or four last ones from Apple (Airport Extreme AC being the last one) I tried to buy the newly released WRT1900AC. All the pro reviews are good, but after a week using it I noticed that the wireless coverage is not as good as my old Apple Extreme, even with all those fancy antennae. When connected, the archieved bandwidth thru wireless seems worse than with the Apple one. A simple test: using my MacBook Pro Retina with AC Wifi, the max speed I got using Speedtest from my fiber optic ISP is 120 mbps. The Ethernet connected computer got 210 (200 nominal speed).Waiting for new firmware releases. If they don't archieve better performance, I'm returning to Apple Airport Extreme...Update: Just went to an Apple Store. Bought a new Time Capsule Airport Extreme 2TB. Connected it (same place WRT1900AC was), now all the Speedtest test I do shows more than 200 mbps. The Airport utility shows my MacBook Pro Retina 802.11ac equipped notebook with a 351 mbps data rate. Way better than Linksys.Later I will test file transfers.","rating":1},{"comment":"I'm finding the interface of this and the usability greater than my Asus router that was supposed to be the end all and be all. Back to a Linksys and very happy. It's got strong range and effortless setup. The Asus had three rear of the box antenna, this has four, and it's more rugged. Very happy!","rating":5},{"comment":"This thing is a BEAST! I have had Linksys routers for over 15 years. Its the first multiband router I have had that has given me not only the best wired processing speed but also the best wireless connectivity. I have this thing in the basement of my office at the back of the building. Both the 2.4 and 5.0 bands are active. At about 75ft all my mobile devices are showing strong to full signal strength. (To say I am surprised is an understatement)I have a gigabit network running a 5 PC small office with 3 Cisco SPA504G IP Phones. The standard Linksys firmware has the SIP toggle that keeps my IP phone system working. In fact it was the main reason for the router upgrade. I was having issues with inbound calls not ringing all devices. My provider advised the router I was using was possibly under powered to handle the load. (We were fine with 2 phones, but apparently 3 was too much for the old GL with DD-WRT) This upgrade fixed those issues.I highly recommend this device for any and all small business owners and enthusiasts at home. I do plan to buy a second device for home (as soon as I can cough up another $250). I like the use of the GUEST wireless networking and the access control functions. Having a Linksys account to access the router and the settings is super easy. You can kill access to your kid's devices no matter where you are and at any time.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is somewhat of a homecoming experience for me, as this device seems to be Linksys saying \"We're back\".  Even though they are now owned by Belkin, this feels like the Linksys of old.  It reminds me, as it is obviously supposed to do, of the WRT54G.  I stopped buying Linksys routers when the Asus RT-N56U was released.  Since then I have also used the Asus RT N66u.  Both have been solid routers for me.This router looks and feels heavy, and that is a great thing.  It is rather large and oddly shaped, but it should not be an issue for most people.Out of the box, the router in pre-configured for plug and play success.  It comes with a setup cd, and an flat ethernet cable. Simply attach the four external antennas, plug it into your cable modem, restart your cable modem so it flushes the stored mac address of your old router (if you are replacing an existing router), and you are set.  I didn't do it this way though.  I am not replacing my Asus N66u.  I am simply using this Linksys as a AC access point.I set mine up the traditional way, by hard coding a static ip address on my laptop and accessing 192.168.1.1 (the default Linksys router address) with the ethernet cable plugged into my laptop and port #1 of the router.Linksys still tried to lead me through a \"Linksys Smart WiFi Setup\", but I declined.  I had to accept the terms and conditions and a checkbox to skip their setup routine.As always, there's no userid by default and the password is admin.Since I have been gone from Linksys so long, I expected the WRT54G user interface, but found a nice looking modern user interface that looks like it belongs in 2014.Besides normal wireless router modes, this router support Wireless Repeater and Wireless Bridge, which are useful when connecting to other AC routers or extending your current wireless network.  I chose to setup as an access point, which is not one of the defined modes.  To do this, you simply need to turn off DHCP, NAT, Routing, and UPNP.  After that, assign this device its own Local IP address (not the Internet Address...that is for your WAN address).This router supports Guest networking, which I have used on old D-Links and My Asus routers.  Oddly though, there is a note on-screen that says your guests will have to connect to the guest network, open their web browser, and then enter the guest password.  This sounds a lot like a traditional captive portal, so I decided not to use it on this router.  It seemingly precludes automatic device to router connectivity over the guest networks, such as if your friend wants to get on your WiFi with their cellphone.  The would not connect automatically, I suppose. Instead they'd have to follow the process as described above.The network map, although simply a circle of devices on your network is nice looking and identified a lot of my devices by name.I don't like the way there is no obvious setting for Wireless AC on this device. There's no 80 mhz channel width or AC in the drop down menus.  Apparently, you have to choose Mixed mode, and it will do it for you.  This can be confusing to new users of AC, especially because there is an option to select Wireless A (not AC).  Not really knowing the difference, some users may pick Wireless A thinking it is AC.I added an external 4GB hardrive over usb 3.0, which is nice to have.Mine came with firmware 1.1.7.160582.  There is a newer revision that includes a UPNP fix, which since I turned UPNP off, should not be an issue for me.  The automatic search for firmware failed, so I had to go to the Linksys Support site for the download.This router supports Android and iOS apps.My only concern with this router is the burning smell that it emitted when I powered it on.  I assume this smell will burn off, like a new car smell disappears.Overall, I am impressed with this router.  It feels and looks like a tank.  It works well, under my setup conditions.  It is providing me great speeds over the 5Ghz band (which is in mixed mode, but seems to be operating at AC speeds).  I pay for \"blast speeds\", which my cable company has recently boosted to 100+ mbps.  On my AC-capable cellphones, running a speed test app, I am getting about 105 mbps to this router (operating as an access point), out to the speed test servers.  These speed tests are short and sweet, so I should not expect sustained speeds like this though.This router also has its own speed test, but it does not function when the router isn't the primary device connected to the cable modem.  Again, in my case, I have an Asus router between this Linksys and my cable modem.I have no issues recommending this to colleagues and friends.  It is very nice.","rating":4},{"comment":"I expected a router with the WRT name and a $250 price tag would be a fully featured device.  It isn't.The existing firmware is designed for first time users.  That's OK, if there is a mechanism to get at advanced settings.  There isn't.  They call it the \"Linksys Smart Wi-Fi interface\", but it's really the \"Linksys dumbed-down Wi-Fi interface\".  The box clearly touts one of it's features as \"Open Source Firmware - Developed for use with OpenWRT\".  But the firmware is NOT open source - in fact, it's the opposite of open source.  It's a closed, proprietary version of firmware.  When setting up, they want you to log in to their \"Linksys\" website, not log directly into the router.  They want to sell you \"apps\" from their store - even though no apps exist yet.  There's nothing \"open\" about this.I originally rated this as 1 star, because some basic functionality didn't work.  I spent over five hours on the line with support trying to resolve it.  They tried hard, but they are not particularly technical.  You have to get past \"level 1 support\" to get someone who isn't just reading from a script.My problem finally went away when I re-flashed the latest firmware (it already downloaded\/installed it during initial setup).  But I'm only upgrading my rating to 2 stars, because:1.  This is a very expensive device2.  It doesn't meet (my) expectations for the most expensive (home) router on the market3.  This is advertised as supporting open source firmware - but it doesn't, and the supplied firmware is EXTREMELY limited in functionality4.  Customer support is terrible.  Not only don't they understand a sophisticated device like a router, but they wasted my valuable time - a good portion of a day - trying to get this to work.  I was at the point that if re-flashing didn't work, I was going to return the device for a refund (or make a REALLY big stink if they wouldn't refund my money).  The only good thing is that they kept trying, even if the first 10 things they tried didn't fix the problem.So, the router is working, it's doing wireless ac as advertised, and even though it's impossible to change any settings other than the most simple, it does seem to work as a router.  I just don't understand how they can charge this much for so little.","rating":2},{"comment":"I'm very pleased with this Linksys WRT1900AC router so far.  It's replacing aNetgear WNDR3800 N600 Premium Edition Dual Band Gigabit Wireless Routerto provide AC service as well as extended wifi range.Setup was painless.  The wizard could be accessed either via Wifi (I used my iPad), or via cable and connection to 192.168.1.1.  The instruction booklet contained the default SSID and password, so that if configuring via Wifi, there was no need to look at the small print on the sticker on the device, as is often the case.  We have a variety of Macs, iPads, iPhones, AppleTV, Nest Thermostat, printers and scanners on our network.  All negotiate their connection to the WRT1900AC faster than to the Netgear, perhaps due to the dual processor managing the Linksys.  I reserved certain network addresses for certain devices as required by our workflow. Set up up our guest network with a different SSID, renamed devices in the network map.  All easy.Range.  We have full bars now in a bedroom that previously required a range extender, and speedtest shows full internet speed at that location.  While some have commented on the potential additional power requirements of this router, in our case, eliminating the power used by a range extender probably makes that a wash.Speed.  I tested transferring a 1.34GB video file from my gigabit-wired Mac Pro to a recent iMac.  With a Wifi AC connection on the WRT1900AC, the transfer was about 24.8 MB\/s (megabyte, not bit) and with a wired gigabit connection it was 95.7 MB\/s, or less than 4 times faster.  In contrast, the best the Netgear could do at N speeds was 3.7 MB\/s.  Getting a factor of 6.6 increase in wifi speed to the iMac via AC is tremendous.The USB port painlessly shared a thumb drive with the connected computers.  I haven't tried the eSATA port yet, which is an interesting addition, as it could potentially give NAS-like speed for the attached device.Range, fast device connection speed, fast data transfer, and easy setup make this an easy router to recommend.  The web interface takes some getting used to compared with others that I've used... for example, finding where port forwarding is buried. But, that's my only quibble at this point.UPDATE:  Even happier now that it is clear that the WRT1900AC resolved various device drops that happened with my prior Netgear WNDR3800.  A Wifi laser printer stays available continuously now, where it had to be restarted daily before.  Apple file sharing between our Macs works 100% of the time now - while with the Netgear, connection by name from Finder was not possible, only by IP address... and even that sometimes didn't work and required reconnecting each machine even though they they were otherwise successfully connected to that router and had internet service.  I suffered through it thinking it was an issue with an OS X update; now I know it was the router.  Great to have fast, reliable connections with the Linksys WRT1900AC.","rating":5},{"comment":"I had a problem getting a strong enough signal from our wireless system to permit the simultaneous use of a computer in a basement office and in an upstairs location.High praise for the Linksys WRT 1900AC Dual Band Gigabit Wi-Fi Router!  It provided us with the means to make this possible.The router arrived in a well-protected box; complete with easy to install instructions.  Hooking it up was very easy for a computer challenged person like myself to do. All I had to do was to disconnect the cables from my existing Wi-Fi router and plug them into the Linksys. I then turned it on and looked for the Linksys signal on my laptop and connected with the provided ID and password.  I then went on line to the Linksys site and completed the necessary registration and verification procedures. It took me about 15 minutes to complete the entire process.Once everything was connected I noticed an immediate improvement for the computers in the basement office and the laptop upstairs. In both cases, the speed more than doubled.The Linksys Smart Wi-Fi site is a great tool and provides a lot of additional value. It allows you to easily set up and monitor your network. The guest access feature allows you to provide internet access to guest without having to give them your network password. The network map allows you to see the different devices on the network and how they are arranged. Based on this I was able to make the printer in the basement office accessible to the laptop being used upstairs. This was a big plus and saved me from having to stop what I was doing in the office to print out a document that was needed by the person upstairs.This is a 5-star router and highly recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"Summary: TheNETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900and the Linksys WRT1900AC are pretty much interchangeable, with the BIGGEST difference being a noticeable wider range of wi-fi coverage with the Linksys. Got a small apartment? Get the Nighthawk (assuming it costs less). Got a larger house with lots of walls and rooms? Spend the extra to get this Linksys router. They are both great home units.Trying to add some information you might not get in the standard review, this is a brief comparison with the NETGEAR Nighthawk AC1900 router which costs significantly less. I love both devices, but my experience might help you decide which to get (or others). I'm a dilettante home geek, not a pro, and most of my testing is with media streaming rather than online gaming.First, the advertised top wi-fi speed of 1300 Mbps using the 5GHz band is pretty much only if you are using an 802.11AC adapter on the client side. I still don't see 802.11AC that widely available, especially if you (like me) tend to buy older PC's and laptops. I've been using anASUS (USB-AC56) Wireless - AC1200 Dual-Band USB 3.0 Adapterfor testing on a couple of laptops and my home brew box, and the speed increase is noticeable and measurable over all other 802 protocols as advertised.Wireless speed: I don't find any appreciable difference in 5GHz between the Nighthawk or the WRT1900AC, and your actual data throughput WILL vary due to all sorts of environmental issues. Both routers give outstanding performance through the USB 3.0 port. I've got a 3 TB USB 3.0 hard drive that I use for serving movies and music house wide and that setup screams on both units. Hooking up USB 3.0 devices to router USB 3.0 ports isn't touted enough, in my opinion. Again, BOTH units have USB 3.0 ports.Coverage: This one's all on the side of the Linksys. Using the Android app \"Wifi Analyzer\" on my phone I could see about a 25% dropoff in signal strength at about 30 feet (Linksys stronger), and when I moved to 50 feet away with several walls, I was still getting a useable connection to the Nighthawk, but the Linksys was barely breaking a sweat. Signal strength difference was over 50% more than the Netgear unit. Again, I'm not doing a lab based analysis, just setting up units and walking around my house. With both units I can go in the back yard or sit in the driveway and still get a useable signal, but the Linksys just kicked the Netgear's behind on this feature.Footprint: Again, comparable. Both have a much larger footprint than most home routers currently in use. The Netgear unit is the larger of the two, but you'll need more space than you might think for both (Nighthawk is 14 x 10 x 3 inches; Linksys WRT1900AC is 10 x 8 x 2). They both also benefit from having some nice airflow for cooling, but I haven't had any problems with either unit through the early summer.Hopefully some of this will help you decide what to get. However, if wider wi-fi coverage is what you're looking for, the Linksys is hands down the best I've seen in a home router (so far). If your needs are to cover less space, the Netgear router is as fine a unit. In almost all other features, they're pretty even.An easy 5 stars if you've got the cash to get one. Both units are on the \"Cadillac\" side of home routers.Final note: If you're looking to hack this unit, the \"Open Source Ready\" claim is technically accurate, but the current state of OpenWRT for this unit is problematic enough I wouldn't recommend that route. The OpenWRT web sites list the status of that software for all sort of units and this one is pretty much alpha or beta-ish (and the wi-fi ascpect isn't functional as of the date of this review).","rating":5},{"comment":"So far so good. Took me 10 min to set up with my new Surfboard modem and I have high speed internet again. I had a linksys e2000 router with a 3 year old surfboard modem. My speeds would hover around 2-5 meg download. After resetting them, they would go to 10-12 Meg's but then go back down after a few hours. I really like having dual bandwidth. I do wish the 2.4 was faster. It stays around 13 Meg's, but the 5 gig is around 30 Meg's. I have the comcast 25 meg plan. So I put the most hungry devices especially those that I use Netflix or HBO Go on the 5 ghz. A little pricey, but you get what you pay for.","rating":5},{"comment":"This new router from Linksys is huge in size, hefty in weight, and blazing in speed. It looks like a Linksys router I owned years ago (the WRT line) on steroids!  I love its 'antique' look, but there is nothing 'antique' about its performance.  The behemoth is an 802.11ac router, but it is backwards compatible with 802.11n\/g\/b\/a.PERFORMANCE:On my home networked PCs with wireless-N adapters, I get a steady 300Mbps connection on both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz connections.  To further test the WRT1900AC, I purchased a wireless-AC1200 adapter for one PC.  On this new adapter, I now get 867Mbps on the 5Ghz band and 400Mbps on the 2.4Ghz&#8212;exactly as advertised for the adapter.  The WRT1900AC router can (allegedly) go even faster with a compatible AC1900 adapter.  While this router doesn't actually increase my internet speed as such, it does seem that way because it makes the connection faster (almost triple) between the WRT1900AC and my PC's AC1200 adapter.RANGE:The range of this router is impressive.  The signal is really strong&#8212;so strong that my neighbor across the street was able to connect from their living room!  My back room PC, which previously struggled to get an average signal from my old router, now consistently achieves 300Mbps on its wireless-N adapter.  Very impressive stats.  The WRT1900AC is made for single and multi story houses, just make sure you pay attention to the antenna array (single story, recommended all straight up; or multi story recommended with two angled, two straight).STUFF I LIKE:* Super easy to setup in four simple steps.  The Quick Start guide is printed on the inside of the CD sleeve, and has user ID and password right at your fingertips.  The CD only contains the manual and warranty info and is not needed for the setup.  There is nothing to install.* 2 x USB ports for attaching external storage.  One port is USB 3.0, and the other is USB 2.0 and doubles as an e-SATA.* Dual band 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz for my home network, and separate 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz guest network (with separate password). Guest network can be turned on or off with one click.* Physical On\/Off toggle switch. Simple but effective, much better than having to unplug the router's power cord to reset it.* The &#34;Smart Wi-Fi&#34; User Interface makes this the most user friendly router interface I've ever seen or used. Kudos to Linksys!  I love this interface!* Firmware is upgradable, &#34;open source ready&#34;* Interface setting: Although it doesn't sound like much, Linksys has included the ability to turn off the blinking lights on the front of the router. People with routers in the bedrooms can finally sleep! Yay!* Interface setting: Built in &#34;speed test&#34; powered by Ookla.* Interface setting: Network Map.  An easy to understand, customizable, visual overview of every device connected. I like this a lot, but I wish it listed assigned IPs as well.* Interface setting: Easy Prioritizing. Drop and drag connected devices to arrange their priority.STUFF THAT COULD BE IMPROVED:* Price. This thing is expensive!* Power users may find &#34;Smart Wi-Fi&#34; user interface too simple out of the box.  Everything is there, it just takes some time to look for it. (eg: took me a bit to find my DHCP client list. Hint: it's under &#34;Troubleshooting&#34;)* For a reason I have yet to fathom, the router can't see my Buffalo NAS as connected external storage. I can see it on my PC and access it, and it shows up in the router's Network Map as a connected device.  However, on the specific settings page for &#34;External Storage&#34; the WRT1900AC says it's not there.  Weird.* Interface setting: Apps Center. I downloaded &#34;Device Monitr&#34; to my android tablet but it didn't work with the WRT1900AC router. Some apps need additional account setup at the Linksys website. Some apps cost money.OVERALL:This flagship beast of a router is the best I've ever used.  If price is no issue, then the WRT1900AC is absolutely top of the Linksys line.  It's powerful yet simple to setup, use, and maintain.  I've had zero issues with dropped connections, just a major speed boost between it and my PC with my AC1200 adapter.  While it works perfectly well with existing 802.11 a\/b\/g\/n network adapters, bear in mind you'll need an appropriate AC1900 adapter to get the most out of this router's capabilities.","rating":5},{"comment":"I purchased the Linksys WRT1900AC Dual Band Smart Wi-Fi Wireless AC Router (2.4 + 5GHz)  to replace a NEW (brand name unmentioned) router to go with the new modem Comcast forced me to buy.  I had hoped that the new modem would actually solve the connection problems I had been having with Comcast broadband for a couple of months: they assured me that my old modem wasnt set up for their new 'faster' speeds. I assumed that was my problem with continued WiFi drops as my modem is in another room. I purchased a new router at the same time. And, of course, the new modem\/router set-up gave me worse problems, if that was possible: the router continually changed channels and I had to continuously reconnect and re-enter my security code every time. I also was seeing a whole raft of new WiFi signals in my WiFi monitor (I live in a rural area with no close neighbors and several homes locally without internet-this should NOT be happening!). Even switching to an Ethernet cable didnt help much.  Finally, I decided to get a Linksys router because I have had good experiences with their products in the past. My internet performance is much more stable now-and the router no longer changes channels randomly.For the record, I am NOT terribly proficient with technology-everything I know I learned by trial end error. I have since found out that my problem is NOT due to the router itself but to the internal routers built into the new DOCSYS 3.0 modems that Comcast requires. The new internal routers (who knew a modem had a router inside???) are set up to provide WiFi access thru your modem to anyone with a password who wants to piggyback on your Comcast service .  (See a CNN Money article on that here: http:\/\/money.cnn.com\/2014\/06\/16\/technology\/security\/comcast-wifi-hotspot\/index.html )  And, since my local utility has been surreptitiously installing 'smart-meters' in the neighborhood, I am apparently picking up the wireless signals from several local meters via my Comcast WiFi. (None of the meters are within the 300 ft usually deemed necessary for the standard WiFi connection . . .but they're sure showing up in my wifi meter!). ! Now, is the utility using my Comcast service to transmit their wireless smart meter data back for a group of meters (without my knowledge or consent, of course)? I have no way of proving that, but there is every indication that this is what's happening. And, those competing wireless signals (which appear to be stronger than my home signal) are constantly canceling me out and knocking me off line.  Because of this I have been forced to disable my wireless connection and solely use Ethernet. At least this way, I dont get knocked off-line completely-although I still get serious slowdowns.  But that obviously is NOT Linksys' fault. It's a much more stable router than the off-brand ones. The price is very reasonable and perfect for the average home network (unless Comcast and your power utility team up to undermine your privacy like they did mine). Linksys makes a good product-you cant go wrong with them!","rating":5},{"comment":"We'd been using a Linksys WRT54GL Wireless-G Broadband Router since our last router died in 2010, and after the cable guy said we might want to upgrade from our ancient unit, I decided better to upgrade than wait for it to die.

I'm currently using the linksys box as my home firewall\/router.  This router is replacing a combination of a Netgear DAP1522 wireless N AP and an Apple Airport Express, and a netgear firewall\/router.  I get more coverage with this one AP than with the two wireless N devices.The router set up quickly and easily.  It works with all of my wired and wireless devices.  It's paired with a TP-LINK TL-SG1024D 10\/100\/1000Mbps 24-Port Gigabit switch.  I have a variety of 2.4 and 5ghz devices and all work flawlessly, with better range and speed than when I had multiple access points.  Ipad 3, Android phone, iphone, mac laptop, windows 7 desktop, windows 8 laptop all connect flawlessly so far.  Streaming video performance over wifi and wired are all much improved.I also have a LaCie 2big Quadra USB 3.0 6TB External Hard Drive (9000354) plugged into the USB3.0 port on the router.  The drive isn't on the approved product list, but it worked once I did the slow NTFS format.  It's plenty fast as a NAS and that was one of the appealing points for me.  I chose the Linksys over the Asus because of the significantly better performance of a NAS.  The router may not have as many bells and whistles as some competitors, but I bought this box for performance.  So far, it has delivered.I plan on adding a Sonos setup to the network and using the drive as a media server for Sonos.  I have the drive set up in &#34;safe&#34; mode with the drives mirrored.  I'm also really happy to have the guest network available.The drive does get a little warm, although I'll have to see if it stays warm under normal conditions, since I've been copying large volumes of data to the drive wirelessly.This router reminds me of when I first got my old WRT54G.  I think this is going to be another winner.","rating":5},{"comment":"Wow. This is a great router that is really fast. Easy to set up and easy to use. The styling harks back to the classic look of the original linksys. My last router was a DD-WRT enabled open firmware that went non-stop for like 5 years. This version is supposed to be open source &#34;ready&#34; and I hope that some great open source versions take advantage of all the various options that this router comes with.The speed is top notch and with all the family devices connected, there has been no noticeable lag or delay in service. We used to notice this when we went to update to a new version on ipads and iphones .... but not with the last version, fast, fast , fast ....I had a couple of zones in the house that never seemed to get great wifi, and now, they are just as fast as any other part. Nice.I am hoping that this one takes me another 5 years.","rating":5},{"comment":"I am sure this would be a great device.  However, until Belkin\/Linksys (and every other router maker) bands together and forces ISP equipment providers to make their equipment fully compatible with devices like the WRT1900 don't buy this device.  Stick with the low quality but working products supplied by your ISP.  There is obviously a profit motive why ISP shut out devices like this, the ISP don't want to lose control of your Internet experience.  They will never provide 'dumb' modems to basic consumers ever again.  Devices like the WRT 1900 are a threat and so there is an entrenched difficulty setting up these devices behind the supplied ISP equipment.  AT&T for instance charges users a fee to get assistance with setting up routers behind routers.  Various work around solutions are posted but a simple bridge-mode doesn't exist.  Unless you have the practice and skill to dig into your ISP equipment, you are looking at frustration in buying a device like this.","rating":1},{"comment":"I seem to run through routers at a pace about one a year.  I had been using a D-Link for quite a while now without issue until recently where it decided to randomply drop connections and give me poor signals out of the blue.  Don't know what happened so I decided to try a new router.Setup on this linksys is very easy.  I plugged everything in and then launcehd into the web based setup.  I was up and running with wireless in minutes.  I found the range of this router to be slightly better than my D-link but not drastically better.  My router is in my basement and I can pick up wireless on my top floor but it is only about half strength.  This router still only gives me the same strength on both the 2.4ghz but I can pick up a slight 5ghz singal which I couldn;t with my older router.  Connecting to the 5ghz even with the low signal gives me decent speeds.So everything on setup and range is OK.  My headaches started when I had to re-setup my other wireless components.  namely, my security cameras.  I don't know who is at fault but none of my d-link cameras would work on wi-fi initially.  Setting them up via ethernet was easy but it could not access my wifi network.  After hours of reading forums I found the solution.  On the router wifi setup it defaults to WPA\/*** personal and mixed security.  Apprently the \"mixed\" default was causing the cameras issues.  I simply changed the secusity to by just personal and they all worked fine.So I don;t know what the main difference is between personal and personal mixed for security but that one tine difference caused issues with setting up my existing devices.  if it wasn't for that, I would say that this is a very easy router to setup.I may try and play with the antennas to see if I can improve the range.  Maybe pointing in different directions from how they are now.  But I am happy overall.Oh...this thing is ugly!!!  This is like a 10 year old router design.  LOL..  But I suppose if it works, don't change it!Update July 15, 2014******I have had some issues with this router with the 2.4ghz band either dropping completely or coming to a slow crawl.  I have updated the firware to the latest version and it has NOT helped the issue.  Seems to pop up after about 2 or 3 days.  The first time it happened, the 2.4ghz signal was lost completely.  Couldn't even find the signal.  Had to reboot.  The second and third time it happened, the 2.4ghz strength was still full bars but every single device that I could test speeds with it was coming to about 2.5mbps down and less than 1mbps up.  Compared to my usual 50+mbps down and 11mbps up speeds I usually see, I knew there was an issue here.the 5ghz signal seems to be stable and I get great speeds with it but the signal strength doesn't reach far enough to get acceess throughout my house.  Plus, a few of my devices do not support that band so it is useless.After reading a few forum posts on the Linksys site, this seems to be a very common issue.  The potential fix that I have tried is to manually configure the 2.4ghz wireless setup.  I changed two items in the setup.  First, I change the frequency to run only on 20mhz as \"supposedly\" this router does not supprt the 40mhz frequency so it gets hung up when trying to shift between the two. I am only quoting what I read on forums and can't say whether or not this works or not for a long term fix.  The other change I made was to pick a static channel to run on rather than have it be auto where it might jump channels.  I chose channel 11.Speeds after the change and a reboot moved back to 50mbps.  The speeds seem a bit jerky at times and they seem to start lower before jumping higher.  It used to be the other way around where initial speed tests would start really high before leveling off.  Hopefully these fixes will work.I am dropping the star rating to 3 on this device since it has required several restarts and manual configuration.  For people not comfortable doing customized setups, this router currently does not make a good choice.  Hopefully Linksys will release new firmware to fix these issues.","rating":3},{"comment":"This is a pretty big router.  I had to make some room on my desk for it.  It arrived nicely packaged and was very easy to set up. The four antennas have to be attached but any fool could do that easily. I followed the quick setup instructions and the onscreen setup process guided me through the whole thing.  My only complaint is that at the end it gave me some message about how it wasn't completely set up, even though it was.  Connecting wireless devices was a breeze. They recognized the router right away and connected using the password supplied by Linksys.I was previously using a Netgear N750 WNDR4300 router.  I compared the wireless performance of the two and didn't note any real difference between signal strength or download\/upload speeds.  This was with the router at the front of the house and a laptop at the back of the house. Granted, I don't have a mansion and the distance was maybe about 50 feet or so and through several walls, so maybe if you have a mansion or a really long distance from your device to the router then it will make a difference.Performance-wise, this router works fine. It does what it is supposed to do. I don't really have any particularly challenging situations for it so I can't comment about any sort of advantage it would have over other routers.  I ended up putting the Netgear back in place, mainly because its footprint is so much smaller than the Linksys (the Netgear can be used vertically, whereas the Linksys can only be used horizontally).  The Linksys looks rather imposing, like a large crustacean on my desk.Construction-wise, the Linksys is first rate.  It has a firm, solid, hefty feel to it, whereas the Netgear feels like cheap plastic. The power transformer is also of higher quality for the Linksys. I suppose it should be better considering the much higher price.  That said, since both perform equally well for my use, I decided to use the Netgear because of its smaller footprint.","rating":4},{"comment":"I've been on a quest to replace my 7 year old router because of performance and reliability issues, so this WRT1900AC came at a good time.This router is physically huge - twice the size of my prior Linksys and when you add the antennas, it looks like it's a bit of a behemoth. Configuration was ok - I had to ditch the helpful &#34;wizard&#34; because it &#34;wasn't able&#34; to connect to my cable modem, but it worked fine the moment I went to manual. Replacing the router with my two different SSIDs and plugging in 2 tb external drive took a few minutes to configure. Overall, the router was easy to configure. I didn't like the needless clicking to accept various licensing agreements, and was a little disturbed at the router wanting to be able to automatically update the firmware on its own. It's one of those things I'd rather do manually down the road than deal with a potential headache with an automatic update.My wireless coverage seems to have improved quite a bit in terms of range and strength. Since I live in a highrise in a crowded city center, there's always been issues with strength and quality since there's severe overlap. The USB 3.0 port is one of my favorite parts of this router. No longer do I feel like I'm going to fall asleep with the old USB 2.0 external drive but it definitely makes streaming of media quicker and less laggy. There's also an eSATA port that you can use as a USB 2.0 port as well.The Linksys Smart Wifi management software is ok. It's nice that I can do Media Prioritization and set hours for Parental Controls, but in my case it's not needed. The prioritization and QoS are good features to have, but I don't have enough devices operating simultaneously that I need to have that control. If I had a well-connected home with lots of devices needing WiFi and needed to budget bandwidth accordingly, then it's a nice feature. There's a fair amount of reporting features as well so I can determine what devices are occupying bandwidth, which is helpful.At $250, I wanted a bit more. No ability to do Time Machine backups is a bit of a downer. You can do DLNA streaming off of the NAS, but no iTunes Server. Those would have been killer features. The fact that this router says it's OpenWRT compatible is cool, but it doesn't seem like you can do it and have it work well quite yet. It's almost as if this is unfinished without Linksys committing to a timetable or roadmap for new features.With most wireless routers, you get what you pay for. And if you have upwards of a dozen devices and a sizeable area to cover, this is worth looking at. It certainly is a better alternative than a weak router with multiple repeaters.","rating":4},{"comment":"Very easy setup and it comes with security and password preset, it is ready to use in a private network.  The unit is located at one end of a large house and produce a marginal signal in the kitchen and upstairs bedroom about 100 feet from the unit with walls between.  When the existing WAP54G in the basement was connected a powerful signal was available throughout the house.  I am certain that if the WRT1900AC router was centrally located it would serve well without the second access point. Then the second access point was connected it came to life instantly and was on the secure network.  Security was not possible with the old unit and this was the primary reason for the WRT1900AC acquisition.","rating":5},{"comment":"There is not much to setting it up.

And it had 25+ devices connected (or could connect) to it. I could give names to MAC addresses and assign the IP address, so the DHCP was very rarely giving out IP's. Things like the QNAP, needed to assign IP 192.168.0.70 and Dlink DNS-323 to 192.168.0.32 (because that's the IP on the firmware on it), but with this WRT1900AC I can NOT assign the MAC a name. I have to hunt and peck to find somewhere to run a report to see what is assigned a IP by the MAC, where on the Dlink it all showed up right there on the same page.That is a FAIL on this router.

Apple TV to stream movies from it (once recompiled in Apple TV format).WELL.......I wanted to copy 80GB from my desktop to the drive. I wanted to do this so I could NOT have to have my QNAP or Dlink NAS on.The Intek is powered by the USB connection.I know this drive works, upgrade the firmware from Seagate on it and it was in my Macbook Pro.If I hook it to my iMac on the powered USB2 hub I have on the desk, I can transfer 100GB to it and never get a error.....so that takes time BUT it works.Well being plugged into the back of the router after about 3-4GB are transferred to it (either USB2 or faster USB3) the router kicks it back as saying the drive \"IS FULL\"I dismount it from the router, plug it in my iMac, select and move the same folders again (and it's on USB2 still but...) it moves just fine. I get NO ERRORS saying the drive is full.So, the USB ports on the router or the router processing itself, stops the transfer of anything over a few 100 MB's at a time.SO THAT IS A FAIL for this \"beast\" of a router....So I am NOT real pleased with the \"support\" for this router.That and after reading and reading because I would want Tomato firmware on the device, there is not any. All has to do with Marvell antenna drivers and that is not a Broadcomm chipset.So \"open source\" again, is just bull*s***.I returned a ASUS RT-N66U router to Tiger Direct (because for one they are here in Miami and that's where they started from) but it was because it just could not handle too much all at once (wireless) and the firmware sucked. And it's USB connection was a FAIL just like this on the WRT1900AC.I ordered this from Amazon.......THEN it hit me.........WHY AM I BEING CHARGED TAX? I understand when I go to a store in person but I very rarely over the years had ever been charged by Amazon. Then I read they charge tax to people in Florida now. Well I am NOT getting any breaks on the price (because it sells for $249 + TAX right here 10 miles away from me and to return it would be to walk back in the store).So that's another pissy thing with Amazon BUT back to the router...........I just don't feel like this thing is \"the beast\" it was made out to be.When I am away my wife just wants to turn on her computer and compute.....NOT have to think about rebooting the router to get online. She is not a technical troubleshooting type person.While this router \"appears\" to be able to do great things, the lack of 3rd party software\/firmware for it puts it in a \"do not BUY\" category.I am sure others have had \"great\" success with using this router but I have not, to the easiness of a simple, informative GUI and looking at whether the open source people are pursuing it to make better software\/firmware.This will be a RETURN in the next few days AFTER I go down the street and but a new router at the same price+tax as I would have to pay to Amazon. Maybe even get it on SALE in the store...Tiger Direct\/CompUSA or BestBuy. They will match the price and charge me tax, just like Amazon.I have over the years bought a LOT of things from Amazon, high price things (>$500) and never thought about it because I was not having to pay tax, so I was saving money. I never pay tax on things from eBay. BUT now having to pay tax, and the same things sell for the same price (most everyday things) right here. I am going to have to start back with going window shopping again.......instead of seeing on the screen.I DO NOT recommend buying this high priced router that, for right now, is just a basic router with 2.4\/5Ghz dual band and 3x3 MIMO.There will be 4x4 MIMO routers coming out with thought put over the AC rates BUT, and this is the thing people just do NOT understand they just see big numbers but really have no idea of how things operate, that it does NOT matter that you have 10Gbit thought put on wireless to your iPad, it's still NOT going to give it to you because your connection to the net is still slower, and a chain is only as strong as it's weakest link.Save you money, look for something in the $125-$175 range if you MUST be cutting edge, but don't buy this....not worth it if you want to do any \"creative\" networking you will be disappointed in the GUI web interface, the problems with moving any file\/folder to the network share that is in excess of 16GB because that will fail too.Asus will be coming out with a RT-86AC (name? I forgot) that is\/will be 4x4 MIMO radios with 4 antennas that actually do mean something.The 4 antennas on this WRT-1900AC are for show. One side is 2.4Ghz and the other is 5Ghz. And \"beam forming\" is just testing the latency from say antenna 1 and antenna 3 and which ever one is less, that antenna is used so you \"theoretically\" are getting \"faster\" speeds by a FEW MICRONS OF A SECOND. The human eye can NOT tell the difference. Oh and Verizon will still lag your Netflix, regardless of how \"fast\" the wireless speed from a router to your TV is.......","rating":1},{"comment":"I bought mine directly from Linksys not from Amazon - at the time, Amazon did not carry it.If this is your ONLY router in the house and ONLY Access Point - It will do well for you.The range is OK - not phenomenal as some have stated.

Ft house (not bragging here - just stating the fact) so in my case, for ultimate coverage, I need to put 2 Wi-Fi Access Points and NOT about to replace my existing Router.SO... if you are going to do that (meaning, place it as a BRIDGE) - then be aware that YOU WILL LOOSE 99% of the features of this router and 99% of its functionality. You WILL NOT be able to use the USB Port as an example or ANY of the features of this router. It will simply be a bridge. This is something NOT stated anywhere in their adds.

If you are an expert - you are going to be PISSED very quickly as there is no way to change the IP Scope in the auto setup. The second you do that- (as in choose a 192.xxx.xxx.xxx address) - the router resets itself and goes back to a 10.xxx.xxx.xxx - in essence if you are trying to setup this with an existing AP - then you are going to be handed an IP address from 2 different scopes and then there is no seamless roaming between one and the other. The ONLY way to make them seamless is to of course setup the same SSID and NOT go through the auto setup - so you have to RESET THE ROUTER TO DEFAULT (hold the reset key for 10 seconds) and then program it from a 192.168.1.1 with admin being the password (stated on the little pamphlet that comes with it - but be sure to bring your MICROSCOPE for that - as it is written in like 2 points.

It's features will trickle throughout the market and down into smaller, more consumer aimed routers in the near future.PROS: Set-up and management is very easy; excellent range and signal integrity, even through multiple floors\/rooms\/walls; handles video exceptionally well through buffering; should be a very robust choice for a small office or even a cafe-like business. Excellent performance for the price.CONS: It's rather large and I don't care for the design, which looks 10 years old. And that it runs so warm 24\/7 that it has its own built-in fan (important for its performance) keeps me from recommending it for the typical consumer at home. Wait for its features to scale down to the home market.","rating":5},{"comment":"I wanted the latest dual-band router to utilize the fairly clear 5 GHz channels since 2.4 GHz channels are very crowded in my neighborhood.  The WTR 1900 AC fit the bill perfectly.  Setup was easy.  Smart Wi-Fi access and monitoring is very useful from locations away from my home.  Prioritization will be very useful in the future.This is easily the fastest router I have owned.  Excellent router!","rating":5},{"comment":"I've tried the Netgear junk, Belkin junk, and pretty much all the others. The only one I've had lately that worked even remotely well (previous to this one) was a Western Digital, but even though it performed well, it didn't last long. Considering what Netgear wants for their stuff, I couldn't see any reason not to go a bit more and try this one out. This has got to be the most powerful router I've ever had. I used to just barely get a WiFi signal in my detached garage (75 feet from the house with the door closed), but now I get a full 'four bars'. I can pick up my network nearly three blocks from my house! I had an extender I had planned on setting up, but now I don't need it. I haven't had any problems anyone else has expressed. Maybe other people either aren't sure how to set them up, or expect too much? As far as the open source issue goes, you have to understand English. The ad says &#34;Open source Ready&#34;, which to me, means that since this is a new router, there could be aftermarket operating systems (firmware) available at a later date. I think a lot of people read that as &#34; open source IS ready&#34;. I remember having to wait a while before WRT firmware was available for my last Linksys router. I have a variety of wired\/wireless devices, and IP cameras, and this router was just as easy as any to set up. Changes are actually handled much faster than any other router I've ever had.Overall, the range, speed, and ease of setup make this easily the best router I've had to date. I'm sure future firmware updates will only make it better as time goes on. Sure, it costs a bit more than those other brands, but those others never have lived up to the hype. This one has, so far. I just hope the lifespan is as impressive.","rating":5},{"comment":"This thing is a piece of garbage!  I bought it 24 hours ago, and have spent 4.5 hours on the phone with Linksys Tech Support.

I was ready to like it before I got it just because I have had such great luck with all previous Linksys products but it has really moved my network up to the next level.First off - setup was simple and intuitive - if you have ever set up a new router before then this one will give you no trouble at all. I won't list all the features because you can see that from the product page but I will tell you the 2 features I love the most.Having a guest account with a separate name and login is wonderful! I hate giving out my info every time I have a guest that needs to get a device on line - usually I have to change my password after they leave just because I'm paranoid. Then the next time someone wants to get on, I have to go thru it all again. With the separate guest account a feel pretty confident about only changing the password as part of my usual routine and don't have to compromise the rest of my network.The other big plus for me is being able to access all my account and network info directly from a secure Linksys site - It's easy to get to from any of my devices so I can do what I want with my home network and see how it's being used, no matter where I am or what device I use.I'd recommend this router for lots of other reasons that people look for too - my connection is stronger even when I'm outside and I love the return of the antennas.  Another plus is that the lights on the front are not super bright - just what I need to be able to tell whats going on but not horrible blinking neon colored lights that light up the room all night. Good job Linksys!","rating":5},{"comment":"For years I've been running two networks off of my Verizon FIOS internet - one is from the router provided to me by Verizon called \"Police Surveillance Van 2\" and the other is off of an attached DLink-655 called \"GrossNet\" (I used to run GrossNet wide-open until I realized that doing so was causing it to crash from overuse every day - I have since added password protection to it).I've added this \"Linksys\" router to my FIOS connection as \"Police Surveillance Van 3\" - I would describe the setup instructions as only \"okay\" - although ostensibly simple, I was somewhat stumped when it said to \"connect to the router from a device\" as I had at my disposal a Windows 7 desktop, a Mac-mini, a Macbook, a laptop running Ubuntu, an iPad, and a Galaxy S3 phone, none of which seemed to get me past the \"Linksys\" product registration page (I wanted to change the name of the router from the default to \"Police Surveillance Van 3\").  Eventually I tried a WIRED connection to the device and was able to get to the router's control page.In the process I noticed that one of the webpages had the name \"Belkin\" in the title.  I thought this was interesting and after googling \"Belkin Linksys\" learned that Belkin has purchased the Linksys brand from Cisco.This router is unusually large for a home application - I had previously seen little monsters like this attached to the walls of physicians' waiting rooms - now I know what they are.The router creates an additional network called \"Police Surveillance Van 3 - guest\" - a nice feature.  I have yet to successfully log onto the \"guest\" network (I thought I knew the password) - I may just open it up (remove the password).Although the router is an impressive piece of iron, I don't think it is worth the extra money.  My unscientific tests do indicate that I can see \"Police Surveillance Van 3\" a bit further away from my house than \"Van 2\" or \"GrossNet\".  Oddly enough the \"guest\" network appears to have the strongest signal of all.","rating":3},{"comment":"Based on the stellar reviews of the WRT1900AC, I purchased this router directly from Linksys pretty much because they refused to give me any support on my old, former top of the line router, the Cisco E3000, without paying them for the support and considering that I have 29 wireless devices in my home, I figured that it was time to upgrade and I have a &#34;go big or go home&#34; theory when it comes to my routers.  I've gone through two of these, now, and I would advise AGAINST purchasing a WRT1900AC.After 19 hours on the phone (yes, 19 hours) with Linksys Tech Support including the tech specialists specifically for this model and Linksys sending me a replacement unit, the only conclusion that I could arrive at was that despite the &#34;stellar reviews&#34; by both industry critics and consumers was that this was a hastily released and unreliable product and the comments in the Linksys forums from average consumers and industry professionals tend to agree with this assessment.  Apparently there are also issues with random reboots and sudden loss in signal all together...  I wouldn't know as the unit couldn't even handle the most basic operations that I needed it to perform in order for me to have it running for any length of time for me to observe this behavior.My broadband service consistently provides a range of 150 - 190 Mbps DL regardless of the time of day (my plan is for 150 Mbps) hardlined direct from the modem.  Hardlining from the router will guarantee a reduction of at least 50% and connecting via WiFi (regardless of band\/channel\/channel width\/MTU, etc.) will guarantee a reduction of at least 75% and that's within 10 feet of the router with no obstructions using an AC rated wireless adapter.As for use with an Xbox 360 Slim... forget it.  The Linksys apologists will blame the built-in N-wireless adapter on the Slims claiming that it causes problems with many routers but I have never had a single issue with my Cisco E3000 or my Netgear wireless routers so you would imagine (and, no, port-forwarding and changing DMZ settings, etc., had no effect) that the top-of-the-line router by Linksys should be able to handle such a common task as connecting to a game console.  Worse, I don't even use my 360s' (I have two 360 Slims) wireless capabilities for online gaming. I use them primarily for DLNA streaming from my PC, again a task that's no problem for my other wireless routers but with the WRT1900AC it doesn't even get out of the starting gate because it times-out the connection.So, why then is it getting all of these rave reviews?  I suspect that it has to do with the fact that both consumers and professionals are only testing it and reviewing it using PCs and with a data plan of 50 Mbps or less.  I say this because I tested it on the service in my office and had no issues with a loss in signal other than what is the normally acceptable loss (10% - 15%) in signal over WiFi to begin with.  So, that being said, it would seem to me that the only people who haven't had issues with the WRT1900AC are the people who didn't need it to begin with or the industry hacks who were testing it under the weakest and most basic conditions possible.What I've discovered through this process is that the wireless router industry is similar to the gaming console industry in that ultimately the consumer is the final Beta tester and more often than not with routers, these manufacturers release a broken product.  But the difference is that the router consumer isn't limited to a new version of their device once every seven years like the gaming console consumer is.  A consumer can confidently purchase a current gen or even a last gen wireless router and expect reliable results as all of the bugs have been worked out for the most part already.So, it's not really an issue of it not being worth paying twice as much for the next gen device, because if it's as advertised, it's well worth it.  If the WRT1900AC actually lived up to what it promised I would have been glad to pay Linksys the $250 for it... but it didn't and traditionally they don't on initial release.","rating":1},{"comment":"Back in the old days, you would plug your router in, navigate to 192.168.0.1 (or similar), enter in a default username and password, and then configure all the settings.  The problem is that, while that works great for advanced users, and even moderate users, the beginners kept leaving their routers totally unsecured and that led to problems.  In response, router companies started providing software with their routers that would walk you through a wizard-like interface to help all the noobs remember all the steps. However, you could still go to 192.168.0.1.That's sort of the case here, but we seem to have taken one more step in that direction.  This router won't let you just navigate to 192.168.0.1 without first accepting all their terms and conditions, privacy policy, etc. and then setting up an account with them.  What?  Yeah, that's what I thought.So here's how it goes.  When you first power up your router and navigate to 192.168.0.1, you have to accept the license terms on the very first page in order just to use the router.  There is an option to skip the setup and configure manually, but even if you do this, you cannot proceed to the next step with accepting their terms.After you do that, you must create a Linksys account.  That requires more terms and conditions and you have to accept their privacy policy, as well.  Note that the privacy policy states that they use information they collect about you to (among other things) &#34;measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others who visit Belkin websites and to deliver relevant personalized advertising to you and others.&#34;  So if I understand this correctly, if you use their router, they will require you to set up an account so they can deliver better ads to you on their web sites.  Cute.  (Note that if you do the standard setup, you are encouraged to set up a linksys account, but not required and therefore you do not need to accept the privacy policy.  Why?  You got me.)  Note also that you must confirm your email account if you setup a Linksys account (so make sure it's real).  You may consider using a throw-away address for this purpose--that's what I usually do...I have set up many a router in my day and have never had to do such a thing.  Personally, I feel that there is WAY too much licensing in the world these days and we don't need Linksys to add to the fray.  I'm deducting a whopping 2 stars for this nonsense!Now, on to the router itself...This thing has a rather large footprint, esp. with all 4 antennas attached and extended.  It is also rather heavy for a router.  Is this bad?  Not necessarily, but something worth noting.  Something else worth noting is that there is a fan built into the unit and vents on the top.  There is also a warning that says not to put anything on top of the unit or it will overheat.  So--large footprint, nothing on top.  Got it?  Good.  Note that I think you can hang it on the wall and that would eliminate any space issues this could introduce.  You know--assuming you have the wall space for that.I personally felt the web interface was a bit overly simplistic, but all the features that I usually use were there, so I guess I can't complain too much...I cannot find anything that says if the WAN port is 100 Mbps or 1 Gbps.  The documentation implies that it is NOT gigabit because all it says on the matter is that the router has 4 gigabit LAN ports with no mention of the WAN port.  I would think that if it was a gigabit router, they would say so right there.  On the other hand, when I plug it into a gigabit switch, the switch shows a gigabit connection.  My interpretation is that the WAN port is gigabit, but they aren't going to guarantee gigabit throughput and so they just don't mention it.  I could be wrong, and if anyone knows for sure one way or the other, I'd be happy to know...  Having said that, I have a 100 Mbps connection in my house and a bandwidth speed test through the router shows 93.66 down and 94.74 up (2ms ping) which shows that it can handle at least that speed.Now let's talk about the power.  The power adapter large provides 12V at (brace yourself) 4 amps. If this were a power saw or a hair dryer, that would be nothing, but for a router that's on 24\/7, that's a lot of juice.  As a comparison, most of my other (older) routers' power supplies only provide up to 1 amp.  One other router that doubles as a NAS (it has a hard drive built in) only requires up to 3 amps.  I'm starting to understand why they are worried about the thing overheating...  Now, to be fair, it doesn't actually draw 4 amps of power under normal circumstances.  In fact, when I plugged it in and measured its actual usage, it idled just under 0.2 amps.  I suspect if I were to load it up with a bunch of traffic, add filtering rules and what-not, that it would show much higher usage, but I wasn't able to measure it in that state.As far as range goes, I was able to set this up in my basement and then go outside and I still got 2-3 bars of signal in a spot that all my previous routers were unable to reach.  Out of curiosity, I decided to walk further away and I got all the way to the corner of my yard with 1 bar remaining (granted, it's a small yard).  The range on this is MUCH better than ANY of my older routers.  I don't know if that's a result of the beam-forming, the fact that it has 4 antennas, a stronger signal, or what, but this thing's got range.Bottom line:  Great performance router with the annoyance of having to accept terms, conditions and a privacy policy to set up a (mostly) mandatory account with Linksys (Belkin).  If you are lucky enough to have a gigabit Internet connection to your house, you'll need to double check with Linksys to see if this can handle those kinds of speeds over the WAN port, but for the rest of this, you should be good to go.  If you aren't technically savvy, then the simple set up interface should make you smile.","rating":3},{"comment":"This router was easy to set up right out of the box and I haven't had any problems with signal going out.  Our house is 2600 sq. ft. with a basement and two upper stories.  We didn't get good WiFi coverage upstairs with our old router, even though it was just on the first floor, and we were having problems with the WiFi going out sometimes.  Now we're getting a better range and we can use 3-4 devices at the same time with no problems.  We haven't used more than that simultaneously so I don't know what the upper limit is for us.

Using the supplied HDMI cable to a Windows 7 based laptop, I get a maximum resolution of 1920 by 1080.  After using a commonly-used calibration tool, the resulting picture is bright, sharp, well-saturated and natural looking with really nice face tones.  Pictures printed from Photoshop Elements look nearly identical to those being displayed on the monitor.  The sound from the built-in speakers is slightly better than the sound from my year-old HP laptop.  The video from the 2.0 MP HD webcam has provided some of the best Skype sessions that I have ever seen.  This unit tilts back and forth on its pedestal, and the side viewing is as advertised.  It is &#34;ultrawide.&#34;","rating":5},{"comment":"I've been staring at a Dell 27 inch monitor for about 4 years. I'm a graphic designer so the bigger the screen the better. My other monitor is aDell UltraSharp U2711 27-inch Widescreen Flat Panel Monitor - Max Resolution 2560 x 1440 (WQHD)and it is stunning. But it also came at a price tag of just under $1,000 when I first got it. So I expect more from it. Which is why I can say that this Dell (UZ2715H) is a pretty darn good monitor for the price.SIZE: 27 inches is huge so make sure you have space for it. It sits on a nice pedestal that allows for easy tilting and positioning and it seems well balanced for such a large monitor. I've had no trouble viewing it from the side, no glare and clear images.RESOLUTION: It is surprising that for a monitor this big, it only has a maximum resolution of 1920x 1080. Again, with the understanding of double the price, my original Dell goes to 2650x1440. I was surprised that the resolution was not listed under features so I thought it was important to mention.COMPARISON: I plugged it in as a second monitor to my system. It was really easy then to see them side-by-side. I've been working with them that way now for a week. And yes, I have a large desk to accommodate two 27\" monitors. What I noticed appearance wise is that the Dell UZ2715 is a pretty warm toned monitor. It is not as crisp but it looks great given the max resolution available.I ran it through a color calibration with aSpyder 3 Eliteto see how close I could get the colors between monitors. It stayed a pretty warm tone with a hint of too much red. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of controls available. Brightness\/contrast, kelvin, and RGB as individual controls. So with some more fine tuning, I could get it where I wanted it.It also has good energy saving settings and multiple methods to plug it in. I ended up using the HDMI cable although you can also use a USB, DisplayPort or VGA. It took me a bit to realize once I plugged it in that it didn't recognize the input immediately. I had to go to the input section on the menu to select HDMI as the setting.There are also USB ports available in the back but you will probably need to connect the monitor to your computer as a USB device or add the USB cable even though you are sending the picture through HDMI or DisplayPort. In other words, you need to connect the USB ports on the monitor to the USB bus on your computer to have them work properly.The benefit of a built-in webcam and microphone\/headphone jack just adds to the great value packed into this monitor.If you are looking for big and beautiful, this is a great place to start.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a fairly affordable, high value, full-featured external monitor. It delivers a very high quality HD picture. The resolution just goes to 1920 x 1080, so it isn't quite the resolution of my retina screen, but it does look great for watching movies, and the colors are quite vivid. It has a built in HD webcam, that delivers a much nicer-looking image than the webcam built into my Macbook Pro. There's also a microphone built in, which is useful if you plan to use this for Skype. It also has built-in speakers, that sound pretty much like you'd expect the speakers on a 27\" HD television to sound: which is a lot better and louder than the sound you get on my Macbook Pro. So this is great for watching movies. (That's a good thing, too, since I teach film classes, and often need to preview things in my office. I'd much rather preview them on this than on my smaller laptop screen.)You can connect it in a number of ways. The most common would be via HDMI or mini display port. It comes with everything you need, including all of the cables. There's an HDMI cable, a DVI to mini display port cable, and a USB cable. With my Mac I can use this as an external monitor using either the HDMI or the mini display port cables. If I want to use either the webcam or the speakers on the monitor, I have to also plug it in via USB.Usually, though, I just need this for its display. I edit a lot of video in Premiere Pro, and it's useful to have an external monitor that matches the resolution of the video I'm editing -- which is always 1080p -- and this works great for that purpose. I actually have two external Dell monitors -- the other one is Dell's S2740L 27\" monitor. I can connect them both to my Mac and use one for a program monitor and one for my color correction tools. The image looks better with this monitor than with the S2740L. In part that is because the S2740L's screen is glossy, and catches a lot of reflection from around the room. Beyond that, the image from this one just looks more crisp. There is no blur, the lines are crisp, and I can't see any pixelation.One thing that I like better about the older monitor, though, is that it automatically recognizes the inputs you plug in to it. With this one, you have to go in and manually select the input before the monitor will recognize that it has been plugged in. That usually wouldn't be a big deal, but since I do have two monitors and both can be plugged in different ways, and I don't keep them plugged in since I'm using a laptop rather than a desktop, it would be nice if I didn't have to go in and change the settings every time I plug it in. What that does mean is that I have to take a couple minutes getting everything set up every time I want to use this monitor. Not a big deal, but the plug and play ease of the other monitor would be preferable. (In either case, I need to go into my Mac's display settings, because by default they set external monitors to mirror the display on my Mac, rather than to extend the display into two additional desktops.)The control buttons are touch sensitive, and laid out on the bottom right hand side of the screen. It confused me at first because the menu appears on the actual screen above the buttons, and I wanted to select options by touching the screen. Rather, the screen shows you which buttons to press on the panel below the screen in order to navigate the menu. Once you get the hang of it, it is all very intuitive and easy.To sum up: I'm very happy with this monitor. It works great for my video editing workflow, delivering good sound and a high quality full HD image. On the rare occasion -- it does happen but not often -- that I need to make a webcam conference call via Skype or Google, the bigger screen and the better camera will make that easy.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a 27&#8221; 1080P monitor.In the box you will find:Monitor with standPower adapter and cableHDMI cableDisplayPort cableUSB 3.0 upstream cable (enables the USB port on the monitor)Drivers and documentation mediaQuick setup guideProduct and safety information guideUnlike most regular monitors it has the following built-in devices:Full HD Webcam (2.0 mega-pixel)Dual digital microphone (Omni-directional)Speakers (2 x 5.0W)USB3.0 Hi-Speed Hub (with 1 USB upstream port and 2 USB downstream ports)The monitor provides the following connectivity:1 VGA connector2 HDMI(MHL) connector1 DisplayPort (version 1.2a)2 USB 3.0 ports - Downstream1 USB 3.0 port - Upstream1 Headphone out\/ Microphone-in combo jackRight away I noticed that the stand only lets the monitor tilt, there is no height or swivel adjustment. You do get standard VESA mounting points so you can change the stand if you'd like but it should have been included. The webcam is a fixed-focus camera but I'd have preferred an auto-focus one. My Logitech webcam from many years ago auto-focuses. The speakers are not bad, not great but not bad. The controls are touch based and not difficult to use. No complaints there and there are a lot of adjustments available.Once I got the monitor up and running I turned the brightness way down and went to work adjusting the color. I messed around with it for quite a while but generally found the picture to look too blue for my tastes. I ended up resetting the settings and getting out my Spyder 3 and calibrating the screen with that. It helped and I am generally satisfied with the color but not wowed or anything.Overall I think this would be a pretty good office monitor or a monitor for mom and pop types. It is a monitor that I'd get for my parents who primarily emails and web browses. The built in devices work well enough and when you consider the package as a whole it isn't a bad monitor.","rating":4},{"comment":"This monitor is excellent. The display is beautiful and it includes lots of features, such as a built in webcam and multiple connection options. It was easy to set up and operate.  There are no dead pixels, the resolution is HD and crisp, and the viewing angles are very wide.We replaced our 24\" Dell ST2420L with this screen. The resolution is the same on both, so we didn't gain any real estate by moving the 27 inch screen, but it certainly looks nicer and has a lot more features, connection options, and a built in web camera.","rating":5},{"comment":"This adapter plugs into a wall outlet to charge my phones and tablets. It has two USB ports, one marked Apple and one marked Android. I also use this to charge my laptop. This charges things fast. Both ports can be used at the same time.

It is not always convenient and sometimes not possible to connect these to a computer for charging.

So the USB wall outlet charger is a very handy device and not having cords is a real plus.The dual port allows you to charge two devices at the same time.  The 2.4 output means you get a fast charge. There is a blue LED light that indicates that the device is charging properly.This is also an extremely handy device for traveling &#8211; easy to pack and again no cords to get tangled up.It price is a real bargain.

I have dubbed it the tablet charger to keep things straight and organized. I use it for both my tablet and my daughters, however it's good for the random charge of cell phones, camera etc... For being able to charge two devices at once you might think that it's a bulky item on your wall, pulling on the outlet, but that's not the case. This is very lightweight and compact so it doesn't bother the other outlet plugin if you want to use it.

I didn't want it to happen again, so I ordered a three pack of the silicon rings. I installed one ring on my Vivofit, and it seems very snug and secure, so I am pleased with the purchase. On top of that, included with my order was an additional four pack of brightly colored rings labeled as a gift. It is great when a company exceeds your expectations.I would also like to mention that Garmin replaced my Vivofit for $69, as a one time forgiveness offer.","rating":5},{"comment":"When deciding whether to purchase a Vivofit, I read reviews both on Amazon and elsewhere, and a common complaint is that the strap does not stay closed.  A common -- and cheap -- solution is to purchase &#34;O&#34; rings (#9) from the plumbing supply section of a home improvement store.  When my Vivofit arrived, the strap did not seem particularly secure, so I picked up some &#34;O&#34; rings.  They keep the band secure but were a bit uncomfortable and not at all attractive.  So, I ordered these fasteners.  They work well and look better, and I had no problem putting on the Vivofit and fastening two of them over the strap, although they fit very snugly.  I'm giving the product only 4 stars because they cost far more than they should.

However, it is very overpriced for what it is.  Hence the 4 star review.  To use correctly, slide the fastener ring on the side of the band with the slots, clasp your band, then slide the ring over the black fastener portion of the band.  It will now keep the clasp from catching on something and releasing.These bands are way overpriced.  They are just a tiny piece of stretchy silicone stuff.  Shouldn't cost more that $5.","rating":4},{"comment":"I bought my Vivofit and had it pop loose twice within a week.  After hearing stories of others losing their device completely, I bought this set of 7 fasteners.These are exactly what I wanted!  They are made of silicone, so they are a little pliable.  They also fit snugly, which is what you need to secure the Vivofit clasp.  Others seem to have problems using the fastener but I find no problem at all securing it once I have fastened the Vivofit on my wrist.  If you are having problems, here is what i do:- with the Vivofit off your wrist and the ends unclasped, feed one silicone fastener onto the end of the wrist strap with the clasp holes.- push the silicone fastener down about 2 holes past the holes where you will clasp the Vivofit on your wrist.- attach the Vivofit to your wrist as normal, snapping the clasp in place.  The silicone fastener ring should now be on the strap between the Vivofit device display and the clasp point.- gently work the silicone fastener down toward the clasp, working it over the clasp point.  Do this my pushing one side of the silicone ring, then the other, along the wrist strap.- I leave my fastener directly on the clasp point.  If you have enough overlap between the two ends the wrist strap, then you can work the fastener down to wherever it is most comfortable, your preference.  Remember that the silicone fastener must be located where both wrist straps overlap each other.","rating":5},{"comment":"Great seller and works great.  So it's just a small rubber band type clasp.

The TaoTronics TT-CD04 gives you the same capability.  This is a really compact dash cam that is easily hidden on the corner of the windshield or behind the mirror.  The dash cam is about 2 inches wide by 4 inches long and has a 2in screen. There is an included suction cup that you use to attach it to your windshield.  The hardest thing for installation would be routing the power cable for the device to the cigarette lighter or USB charger unless you want to have it dangaling.The dash cam comes with an 8 GB micro SD card and it is ugradeable to 32 GB.  Though, 8 GB is more than enough as the dash cam will loop to write over old video.  If by chance you are in a crash then that video will be locked so it isn't overwritten.  The dashcam also has a 260mAH battery.The dash cam starts and stops automatically.  When you start your car the dash cam is powered on.  When you shut your car off the dash cam is turned off.  Day time recording and night time recording are both clear and crisp.  The night time recording on this dash cam is better then others that I have seen.  It comes with a multitude of customizable features as well such as real time clock, video time stamps, snapshots, manual locking of videos, x4 zoom, record sound off or on, etc.More Noteable Features:3m pixel color CMOS cameraFull HD 1080p@30fps recording120 degree viewing angle2 infa-red LEDS for night visionBuiltin MIC and SpeakerH.264 Video CompressorBuilt-in motion detectorBuilt-in Shock SensorThere are also a couple of ways to view the recorded snapshots or video on the device, putting the micro SD into your computer or connecting the dash cam to your computer via USB.  The folder layout is per day with the MOVs or JPGs in these folders.Overall, this is a great dash cam that isn't bulky and is easily concealed.  It comes with an array of customizable features and would be a good investment.I was supplied a sample product for review purposes.","rating":5},{"comment":"I give it 5 stars based on about a week's worth of use.  I chose this cam mostly because of its design.  It was similar in look and size to one I had before from another company.  I prefer this design to many others I see out there.And performance-wise it has not disappointed.  I especially like the ease of menu, built in battery (just in case), and ability to turn off microphone.  And it produces an excellent video as well.  I haven't experimented much with the different exposure settings,  but +1.3 gives enough light for most nighttime driving situations.I am a truck driver, so this is a very important tool for me.  I definitely want to have my rear covered in the event of some unlikely accident.","rating":5},{"comment":"TheTaoTronics TT-CD04 Full HD 2' TFT LCD Mini Car DashCamis a tiny but ultra-functional dash cam to have in the car for both protection, and a variety of uses.Perfect for capturing most of the things you will see while driving, this unit is designed to attach to your window, in an area that won't block your view.  The small size of this unit means it takes up very little room and after install is almost easy to forget you even installed.The camera features a built-in battery, however for most driving instances you will need to have the unit powered via the included cable.  The TaoTronics cam comes with a cigarette lighter charger and a good long length on the cable, however I have found that the unit can charge via USB and I use my unit with a USB car charger to preserve my cigarette sockets for my other gear (Satellite radio, Radar Detector, etc.).In my tests on the road, the video is both clear and easy to see, really really good quality.  Another reviewer has captured some of their adventures driving with the unit so I am focusing this review on what comes with the unit and the general quality.  With regards to the video quality, I am quite impressed with the unit.Installation is simple, slide the unit onto the suction cup mount, then attach the mount to your window.  Goes without saying, you should always get the area you plan to attach it to as clean as possible before install.  The unit is easy to remove in the event of extreme weather (subfreezing temperatures, etc.) while leaving the mount attached where you want it.The unit ships with an 8GB micro-SD card, not a common inclusion, and can be attached to your computer with the included mini-USB cable for transfer and review.  The 2\" built-in screen is just enough to ensure you get the right view for setup, but not too much to make the unit bulky or over-sized.The unit can be customized to your needs making it really accommodating.  The cam even auto powers on when I turn the car on, no muss no fuss, smart. The unit does have a mic for recording audio, but you can disable that if you do not need it.  Built-in night vision lights allow for good views during night driving.  I found the included user's manual to be a great resource for finding all these features and more, however I figured out most of it before even opening the manual.Overall, I really like theTaoTronics TT-CD04 Full HD 2' TFT LCD Mini Car DashCam.  The unit performs exceptionally well, and has lots of great features.  The compact size is great and the suction cup mount makes putting this cam in different cars when needed a breeze.  I have tested and own several other types of dash cams and I really like this one the most because when installed, it practically becomes an invisible part of your car.[Review Sample Provided For Evaluation And Review]","rating":5},{"comment":"","rating":5},{"comment":"I got this unit because I drive over 150 miles a day.  I spend 3+ hours a day on the road.  The likelihood of an accident is greatly increased and I thought this might be helpful if I'm in an accident and I'm not at fault.  While it works great for that purpose, I found that it help me in a way I didn't expect.I was on my way to work recently and as usual, I was speeding.  A highway patrol was hidden from view and got me with a radar.  I saw him as soon as I passed but it was too late.  As soon as I saw him pull into the road behind me, I reached up and pulled the camera down.  I saved the video and stashed my camera.  I had to save it right away as I had it set to loop every 5 minutes.  Thinking back I could have used the shock sensor and just smacked the camera and it would have locked the video.  Anyway, when I finally went to court, I presented the video as evidence and the ticket was dismissed.The TT-CD04 is a top notch device for a great price.  The possible uses are endless.  In addition to locking the video if it senses a crash you can also disconnect it from power and talk a walk around your car to record any damage.  No worrying about having to take pictures of everything.  Just shoot some high resolution video...and...bonus...it records sound as well so you can provide narration of the events, witness statements, and even a statement from the other driver.I won't drive without it.

Shared the sample video with a friend and he was astonished at the clarity.  It's easy to use, and has a zoom lens feature on video.  Exceptionally small device so it does not obstruct your field of view while driving.  Only drawback is that the monitor times out (goes blank) while you're driving (to save power), and I got the impression that it was not recording.  Well it is still recording while blanked out - this is the screen saver feature and it is user settable in the menu functions.  I recommend the camera to anyone who wants to do scenic filming or make a case if involved in an accident.","rating":5},{"comment":"I bought a pair of these on woot.  I received them dead; they would not take a charge (in fact the charging LED would not even light up).  I tried using my own USB cable as well as a wall charger to no avail.Most frustrating, I emailed Pyle support via email (woot was sold out so could no replace), and they did not respond at all.  Obviously, this brand cannot be trusted.  Everybody knows from time to time a defective product gets past you, but there is never an excuse for no support.UPDATE:So after I posted this review, Pyle technical support left a comment on it.  As requested, I sent an email.  I told them I already returned the item to woot because, as I stated in my review, it was inoperable and Pyle never got back to me.  I didn't expect them to really do anything. But I figured I'd hear them out and perhaps change my review based on their response.The good news, they decided to actually email me back this time.  The bad news....they didn't bother to read my email.  I stated clear as day that \"Because I received no reply and the headphones were inoperable, I returned the unit to Woot.\"  Yet, the entire reply was a boiler plate email on receiving warranty service and stating that I may send the item to them and \"if the item is still under warranty, you will also need to include a $5 money order to cover the return shipping.\"Yeah, no thanks.  So, rather than saying no service, I'll have to revise to totally incompetent and utterly useless service.UPDATE 2:After posting the previous update, Pyle sent me a functioning unit.  It should be noted that because the previous unit had already been returned, I essentially received this item for free in response to the above review.Had I received this pair initially, aside from all support issues, I would have rated it four stars.  As I had nothing to lose, I treated it vigorously.  I had it at the bottom of a 6.5 foot pool and it still works fine.  It charges quickly and, while I have not attempted to gauge battery life, I have had no issues in this regard.The sound quality is fairly mediocre, but I am more picky than most in this regard, and did not buy it for regular music listening.  There aren't a whole lot of waterproof Bluetooth headphones, so I have nothing to compare this to in this regard.  It is certainly not up to par with high-end headphones, but it's not the worst I've heard either.The only reason I would not have given it 5 stars is the look and comfort.  I both looks and feels like cheap plastic, including when it is in the ear.  While it includes several silicone tips, the plastic it slips over is wider than most in-ear headphones.  It does seem to hold in well though, and is probably suitable for joggers.  My biggest complaint is, oddly enough, with the blue blinking light.  The blinking is very conspicuous, especially in darker areas.  It cannot be seen by the person wearing it (unless in  a dark room where the reflection can be seen), so I fail to see why anyone would want a bright constantly blinking light on the side of their ear.As with all Bluetooth devices, it does not work under water.  As soon as the right earpiece drops under water, it loses the signal.  As this is inherent in Bluetooth technology, I would not consider this a fault, but it should be made clear.Nevertheless, due to the extremely poor support, I cannot give it a high rating.  I hope Pyle improves in this regard.","rating":3},{"comment":"These are really nice waterproof earbuds. They can be used in the pool and hold up well. They have a waterproof rating of IP46 or maybe 1P46? I have no idea what that means. But they worked with my head submerged in the bathtub listening to audiobooks. They are lightweight and fit around my ears comfortably. The first put-in you need to get them in firmly to get the best possible sound. The sound is good and the bass is perfect, but only if inserted fully. I couldn't hear any distortion at top volume, so there's that. I'm not an audiophile, so these are great for me.I charged them initially for about 1.5 hours. They have lasted around 4.5 hours with constant listening. The range seems to be about 25-30 feet and then starts to break up.Sample provided without obligation.","rating":5},{"comment":"Over-the-ear headphones with earbuds aren't my favorite style of headphones, but I often see folks wearing them, so I know they're popular. I don't know if I'm just clumsy or it's the shape of my ears or what, but they just don't work well for me. But the Pyle PWBH18 headphones are one of the better products of this type that I've seen and actually used.First of all, there's the IP64 rating. International Protection Marking codes, also known as IP codes, classify and rate the degree of protection provided against the intrusion of dust and water by mechanical casings and electrical enclosures. IP64 indicates that a device is dustproof and is protected against splashing water. The headphones are not intended to be submerged or subjected to spraying water. They're water-resistant, not waterproof, although the instruction manual incorrectly refers to them as waterproof.I paired the headphones with an Android tablet. It paired quickly as device &#34;PWBH18.&#34; I streamed some iHeartRadio stations and played some of my MP3s, and the audio quality was pretty good for earphones. The Bluetooth signal was stable for distances up to around 25 feet, but if interior walls came between the source and the headphones, the range was less.It only took a few minutes to charge up the headphones' built-in 80mAh battery. The charging port is on the left earphone. On the right earphone are the power on\/off button, plus two small raised buttons that control volume and tracks. To increase or decrease the volume, hold the buttons until the volume is set. Brief presses on the volume buttons advance the track or return to the beginning of the current track. Pressing the &#34;+&#34; button twice is supposed to return to the previous track, but that didn't work for me. Running the headphones continuously while playing music, the battery lasted for a few minutes more than six hours, which exceeds the stated play time in the instruction manual.As a hands-free phone device, the headphones worked well when paired with my Moto-X phone. The function button (the large button on the side of the right earpiece) works to answer a call or to hang up. Voice quality was good.If you like this style of headphones for listening to music or radio, and if you also want a hands-free phone device, the Pyle PWBH18 is definitely worth a look, especially if you use it in a damp environment.A product sample was provided for review purposes.","rating":4},{"comment":"My only disappointment with these is the slightly distorted sound, especially at higher volume.  I did not try to fully immerse them because instructions say &#34;it is designed to ensure normal operation in water at a specified conditions [sic]. It cannot be immersed in water.

This is poor merchandising and I can see why several other users went right under the water and killed them fast.  On the plus side, they are comfortable and easy to use, and no problems with range. Price was also modest.  Got them because there is not much else available in this kind of product.  So they are waterproof except when you get them wet!","rating":3},{"comment":"First thing first, these headphones are waterproof but are not designed not for swimming.  The IP46 rating pertains to be water jet resistant but not submersible.  You can use it without any worries on your jogs even if you get caught on the rain.The sound quality is splendid.  There are a lot of earphones with teeny weeny bass but not the PWBH18.  Good highs with a good balance along the spectrum.  Specs say 20Hz-20KHz.  It can receive phone calls with a push of the Function button.Pairing is a breeze, it automatically appeared on my device when I turned it on. Includes a microUSB charging cable and 2 pairs of extra buds to fit your size.  You just have to get used to how to properly fit it in your ears.  The ear hook is pliable enough to conform with my lobes.Quick specs:- 80 mAh built-in Li-Poly battery- Bluetooth V 4.0- Rated IP46- Separate buttons for volume controlCons:-  The wire is adjustable but it can be a little short for some people.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.","rating":4},{"comment":"My friend travels all over the world and this took the place of many chargers.

With its compact 7&#34; size, ample screen brightness, and super quick Intel quad core processor, it is the tops for an entry level tablet.  With the KitKat operating system, you get the latest that Android has to offer, but with a couple of caveats to go along with it.  To get optimal battery life, you have to play with the settings more in KitKat as compared to Jellybean.  Also, in KitKat Android\/Google has finally clamped down on how third party programs write to and access the micro SD card storage, so programs you may have been using such as navigation programs may not work now unless you install the maps to the main memory, which is sometimes not what you want to do.  Hopefully, these apps will be refined and updated to make them be able to use the external SD card so you don't have to use your main system memory, but that is goint to be in the hands of the app developers themselves to get inline with how Google wants it done. Also since this is an entry level tablet and to keep costs down, it only has a 2.4 Ghz wireless radio so dual band reception is not in the picture.  The radio installed is good and on par with other 2.4Ghz units, but to some this may be a reason to stay away from purchasing this tablet.Overall, I am very pleased with the tablet.  It is thinnner and lighter than the MeMo Pad HD7 I just got my daughter for Christmas 2013, and much faster. It is faster than the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0 that I just bought for myself. I decided to relegate the Galaxy Tab for work use, and I'll use the Asus MeMo Pad at home.  You can't go wrong with this tablet as the value and quality is there and much improved over last years model, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone wanting a good little tablet or eReader.","rating":5},{"comment":"We've owned several ASUS laptops and notebooks over the past several years, and we've always been very impressed with their performance.  This latest addition to our household electronics collection is no exception, a well-priced and strong-performing Android tablet.The device is clean looking and boots quickly.  The screen isn't HD, but it's still very nice with vibrant colors.  The 1 GB of RAM should be sufficient for most users, and all of the streaming video options I tried worked well.

Just be sure you really like the tablet experience, if you haven't already made that determination. I was warned that Android systems aren't as intuitive or easy to learn as Apple and Windows, but this isn't all that challenging.My connectivity devices were limited to my desktop PC and my iTouch, and I'm probably the only North American over the age of 10 who doesn't have a smartphone. I got the iTouch to replace my old Classic iPod. But instead of just listening to music on the iTouch, I found myself also using it on my home wireless network to check emails, Facebook, surf the Net, etc.So I thought a tablet might be better for that purpose, since it's bigger, but not as limiting as sitting in front of my desktop PC. In some ways, I was right. The ASUS MeMO Pad 7 screen looks great, and the popup keyboard is easier to handle. Net surfing is more pleasant.But the size isn't ergonomic, for lack of a better word. It doesn't fit into one hand as easily as the iTouch, but seems too small for 2-hand use. It doesn't fit into a shirt pocket, and I don't carry a purse.I've been waiting for years for the wizards to come up with an all-in-one that makes sense: computer, phone, Net access, music player, camera, camcorder -- all in one neat, easy-to-handle package. The ASUS MeMO pad 7 isn't it. Neither is the iPhone. Maybe it's an impossible dream. Hand-helds are too small for power computing (and writing), PCs and Macs aren't mobile, and tablets, which seemed so promising, are caught in between, not strong enough to replace your PC, not small enough to replace your smartphone. And the ASUS MeMO Pad 7, to be clear, is not a phone and does not offer 3G or 4G connectivity, just WiFi.","rating":4},{"comment":"I purchased the Acer Iconia A1-830 previous to this purchase and also have a Nexus 1st Gen tablet and here is what my experience is thus far.This is for the red Asus MeMO yet they all are the same!Size: The tablet is a smaller 7 inch, its smaller than the Nexus 7 and probably CAN fit in your pocket! Fits VERY COMFORTABLE in your hand! Even if you have smaller hands you will probably feel very comfortable holding this as you do your phone (to a certain extent)Build: It feels well built! The red finish on the back the feel of the tablet in your hand is ideal! The screen feels more sturdy and built of a better quality glass than the Acer Iconia A1 830.Speed : This is the FASTEST tablet I own! This thing is faster than my Nexus 1st Gen (and should be its more current)Response : It also excels in this area as it is the MOST touch responsive tablet I own! As with the Nexus (not with the Acer Iconia A1 830) your drop down (notification) screen is ALWAYS available with what ever app is running (with the Acer you have to minimize the screen on some apps to see notifications and battery level which isnt that convenient)Sound : &#34;Stereo&#34; speakers (dual speakers on each side of the bottom BACK of the tablet) and out of the other 2 (Android) tablets I own this tablets sound is the best (not by much over the Acer Iconia but sounds MUCH better than Nexus 1st Gen) and is louder than both.I do own a Windows RT tablet which I feels speakers are better but thats another story as that being a Windows 10inch tablet and were talking Androids here!Screen Resolution : This is a very good for this budget tablet! Definitely better picture quality than the Nexus and Acer A1 830. Deeper blacks and more vibrate pop of colors!Battery : This tablet has run on a video application which has been continually looped for over a week! I have not shut the tablet down yet it has run out of battery ONCE and has NOT given my ANY problems charging up again!THE BATTERY IS ONE OF THE LONGEST RUNNING BATTERIES ON A TABLET I OWN! This bad boy runs over 9 hours PLUS on the LOWEST brightness setting on continuous with no screen time out (adjusted this in settings) of continuous video for OVER 9 HOURS!INCREDIBLE!Charges up from 0 to 100 in under 2:20 mins  with it ON running an app (video app)Verdict: This tablet is the fastest has the best screen resolution is the most responsive and offers the specs a Nexus does but probably better for cheaper, its smaller  and more &#34;stylish&#34; the only thing is... THIS TABLET COMES PRE-INSTALLED WITH BLOATWARE you CAN NOT UNINSTALL!!!

In some ways it would be unfair to do so because the Nexus 7 is a Google device that was built according to their specs however this tablet was entirely designed by ASUS from the ground up and I will detail those designs one by one. In doing so, I will compare to Nexus 7 when necessary.DESIGN------Very, very small. By that I mean it literally fits in your pocket. The portability of this is amazing. If you have a 10 inch or even an 8.5 in it becomes a nightmare to shelp around with you especially during the summer when you have nothing on you. Being able to conceal this out in public makes it even more special because to me portability is important.Sure it would be nice to have a bigger screen but bigger doesn't always mean better.DISPLAY------I haven't officially tested this completely yet in various types of light (sunlight, nighttime) but so far so good. You can adjust the display so that's good. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't have an auto brightness mode (Unless it's hiding somewhere) but this shouldn't really be a deal breaker as I'll explain shortly. Although everyone has their preferences, you can adjust to your liking. I'm not sure I am happy with the settings as of yet but so far everything is crystal clear and sharp.PERFORMANCE-----------AS I said above, there is no auto brightness feature but ASUS seems to do something no one else does and that's an \"ASUS OPTIMIZATION\" feature which allows you to conserve battery. Not sure how this works except that one feature is that it turns off the WiFi when in sleep mode. Again, when it comes to this it's a preference so what works for me may not work for others.The MeMo Pad does perform fast though thanks to:HARDWARE-------For the price point (this is meant as a budget tablet) you get VERY good specs. ASUS was pretty generous.Android 4.4 KitKatCPU Intel Atom BayTrail Z3745 Quad-Core 1.33GHzGPU Intel HD GraphicsRAM 1GBMemory 16GBAnd for those who don't know, 16 GB isn't really 16  because half of that is ASUS's software (which is a lot) so out of the box it's about 12.5 give or take but that's okay because there's a micro SD slot expansion that's good up to 64GB (If you are like me, you will be using this to put downloaded movies)Camera Rear : 2MP; Front : 0.3MPNot much but seriously does it matter? You'd be surprised how many people won't buy a tablet if it lacks flash or higher mega pixels. I mean the front would technically only be used for chats and maybe selfies. And at 2MP, this isn't really bad. How many people will actually take pics with a tablet anyway? Besides that, in a budget tablet, some sacrifices have to be made so be glad it was with the camera.SOFTWARE-------I mentioned before how ASUS has some preinstalled software on this thing and they are:ZINIO - The World's Largest Newsstand 6 free Mini-Subscriptions to your favorite magazines and a $10 voucher at registration. 6 free Mini-Subscriptions to your favorite magazines and a $10 voucher at registration. 6 free Mini-Subscriptions to your favorite magazines and a $10 voucher at registration. (I don't use this but it could come in handy for others. I'm not even sure what the minis are as there's no voucher or coupon out of the box)eMusic - A discovery-and-download destination for people who love music. Play, discover, and download music wherever your day takes you Enjoy 75 complimentary music downloads from ASUS. (If you are a music fanatic then this is a really generous offer)Obviously ASUS put their own stuff on here some useful and some not. The problem with pre installed stuff is that they are nearly impossible to delete.ASUS WEB STORAGE: 500GB free of charge. I believe this is more then whatDropboxoffers.AUDIO WIZARD: I failed to mention that the MeMo Pad has stereo speakers and as such has the audio wizard which is pretty nifty. What this does is basically allows you to be your own DJ. For example: If you are watching a movie (either your own or throughNetflix) just press the MOVIE button and you will get theater quality sound. MUSIC will give you studio quality. So on and so on.... You get the idea. And if you toggle the sounds you will notice the difference. To my knowledge, this feature only works if headphones aren't plugged in.Also, some Google apps come already installed.I'm with the tablet for less then 24 hrs so this review is based on my usage so far and I am sure there's still more I am discovering however so far it's not bad at all and I'll end this review with a summary:1)Price point is excellent.2)Specs are very generous3)Design is excellent (looks like Nexus 7 only smaller)4)Software: It is what it is. What can you do?5)Hardware is goodLacks an HDMI port but it's purposely admitted because of Miracast which is supposed to \"beam\" to your TV. Honestly, I have no idea how this works as I haven't tried it let alone finding it in the menu. I don't even know if your TV has to be Miracast compatible. Ah well.

While so many people have considered the Apple Ipad as the best value for the money, there are other companies that have also shown to make great tablets that have not been noticed. Asus, which had made the Google Nexus 7, has made some really good tablets other that have worked so well. But they are also trying to deliver the next generation of great tablets are doing it again with their newer Memo Pad 7, which has a very fast processor, that works very well and can store as much memory as you can on a Ipad, and a little more by storing all your data in the tablet, or a external Micro SD Card, whether it is your music or ebooks, or personal business files. This tablet handles very well. I also like that it has a strong and simple interface that can work flawlessly, and easy to install all your apps from Google's Play store or the Amazon appstore.

They're simple, robust tablets for those of us who want a convenient streaming device with maybe a couple other app options.  I think this is the right tablet for those applications.We got the ME172V for my old dad to use when Skype-ing.  7&#34; is maybe a LITTLE small for someone his age, but otherwise it gets the job done.  The ME176CX has less storage, but is better overall with a faster processor, bluetooth, and front AND back cameras.

I am finding that the battery totally drains in less than two days with practically no programs running. I even downloaded Android Assistant to monitor battery usage, have WiFi turned off unless I need it, etc, but still get fewer than two days on a full charge. I will keep trying to improve battery life but I am removing a star from my initial review because of battery life.Original ReviewI have been using the ASUS MeMo Pad 7 ME176CX-A1-BK 7-Inch Tablet for a little less than one week now, and so far I am pretty impressed by its performance.  This tablet is super thin and very light, measuring just 7.50 x 4.50 x 0.40 inches and weighing 11.2 ounces. This device is very ergonomic. I find that I am able to use it with one hand (I have average sized hands), which is very convenient while commuting.The latest Android operating system, KitKat 4.4 is installed on the ASUS MeMo Pad 7, and the tablet has the Intel Atom Quad-Core processor and 1 GB RAM, 16 GB on-board, and a slot for a micro-SD card (up to 64 GB). I tested the MeMo Pad 7 with a number of applications, including games, and did not detect any hesitation or stuttering. Video renders nicely, and of course basic web browsing and e-mail are a snap.To compare the display to a similar tablet, I put the ASUS MeMo Pad 7 side-by-side with my Kindle Fire HDX and the Fire's display is sharper and brighter. The ASUS has a 1280 x 800 display, a narrow bezel design and is fine for day-to day-use, especially while traveling.The weakest part of the ASUS MeMo Pad 7 is probably the camera, but this is not a huge deal for me, since I don't use tablets to take photos. I tried to take some photos and noticed the camera lags while trying to take photos indoors.Along with KitKat, the ASUS MeMo Pad 7 has the ASUS Zen UI, which adds additional features to the operating system, including a battery optimization feature that shuts off Wi-Fi when the tablet is not in use, and a \"What's Next\" personal assistant that helps you manage your calendar.There is a lot to like about the ASUS MeMO Pad 7. It is priced lower than most other tablets with similar specs, performs well, and is very thin and very light. The ZenUI adds some nice features, and I like the fact that memory on the tablet is expandable. I highly recommend this tablet, especially when compared to higher priced tablets from the competition.","rating":4},{"comment":"It's a great product.I'm using it right now!","rating":5},{"comment":"pros: it's very lightweight, the display is crisp, it's powerful, has back and front cameras.  Has many fun tricks.  There is a mirror view--you can see your face in the display.  Has a mini usb socket to store data.cons:  I think there is a power issue.  If you put it in sleep mode, the battery drains anyway.  I hardly used it and I have to power it up every other day.  If I turn it completely off, then the battery doesn't drain. There is no light on the tablet to tell you if it's finished charging, which I found is popular today.  However, it does make me wonder when the booklet says that I should remove the charger as soon as the tablet is charged or there may be a problem.  The booklet doesn't say what the problem is.Overall, it's a compromise.  Great price for a powerful tiny tablet.  But it does come with a few problems.  I bought it to replace my kindle fire which is aging, but the kindle is more user friendly because it's tied into Amazon.  And maybe I should have bought  newer kindle instead. I don't trust Google.  It knows more about me than I wish.  Has gps, etc.  And it suggests ads to me based on my searches.updated:  just found out how to download the Amazon appstore app on this device, so I'm pleased.

I want to add something on their customer service as well because I have had to call about three different tablet brands over time and the ASUS customer service was really helpful and nicer overall. I had an issue out of the box with regard to access and the representative sat on the phone for over an hour making certain that the issue was remedied and that I had no more questions. Kudos for that.This tablet is really light, which is something I like a lot, but it feels good while you hold it. Some of the models outside the ASUS line I have tried out in the past felt or looked cheap and that is annoying. I want a reasonable price, but I also want a tablet that looks and feels good and this fits the bill. It is also easy to use, with the newer menu changes making finding specific items a lot easier. This is something I try to keep in mind when picking up a tablet for family members who are trying to shake their Luddite status.As far as speed goes, I can definitely tell a difference with this model compared to previous ones. Loading items from the internet, running programs; it has made me a lot happier. My older tablets lagged or delayed but this one brings up items with a snap. The display looks nice, too, and can easily be seen in day use, and the speed kept up with 1080p streaming. I like reading on the go, especially comic books, and find that the newer tablets bring out a crispness that adds to that - although I will note that there is a lot of zooming if you use a 7' tablet. The specs are nice for the cost; 16 GB and a gig of Ram; add in the SD slot, a MUST in my book, for additional items or carrying specific files and that makes the tablet useful for all kinds of hobbies.A con for some is the camera, which is grainy anywhere you need a little light. I am not prone to take pictures with my tablet anyhow, and a 2 megapixel camera is something that does not tempt me to start anytime soon.All in all, a nice tablet.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is my 5th tablet in the 7&#34; segment and so far liking it - Previously I had tried the Kindle, Dell, Lenovo A1 and the Nexus.The unique thing which I like in this table which sets it apart are:(1) Excellent wifi connection - unlike laptops tablets have poor wifi connectivity and this one is different - not sure what they have done internally, but has a better range and does not disconnect frequently like others do(2) Performance:  I am no gamer, but I can easily tell that apps load faster, web pages render faster on this table compared to the others I have used.(3) Build Quality - does not look like a flimsy cheap tablet and for this price point - this does pack a lot of power and quality.Overall - I just love this tablet and would rate this higher than the kindle.

Yet another keyboard case of an iPad?  &lt;yawn>  Oh wait, this one lights up?  Ok, yeah, I'm interested.In my time of reviewing, I've seen dozens of different keyboard cases for more every popular tablet as well as generics.  The Zierra is the first of it's type in several ways, one of which is that light up keyboard.  The design also cleverly uses the iPad's own magnetic areas for turning the unit on and off, as well as holding the clamshell closed and holding the iPad to the keyboard surface when in the upright position.  Clever it may be in spots, but in others, the Zierra isn't so great.  Unlike a number of one piece keyboard cases, the to halves of the Zierra look to be held together by a strap that is glued on.  True, it held together just fine with I tug and twisted at it, but it looks...cheap\/tacky.  Another point of appearance disapproval, most every other clamshell has the nice pretty cover on the iPad side and the less attractive bottom cover (the part that will sit on the desk and no one will see) on the keyboard side.  Like a typical laptop.  The Zierra does this backwards, which for me is very weird.  In the Zierra's defense though, I showed this off to an Apple nut I know, and she disagreed with me 100%.  Ok, so maybe I'm the one that is goofy on this point.Anyhow, over the last month of use, the Zierra has held up just fine.  The backlight on the keyboard is a bummer.  It looks really cool, I'll give it that.  But the keys are solid, unlike other backlit keyboards where the letters on the keys are semi-translucent.  Because of this, the backlight is totally useless for typing in dim or zero light conditions - you can't see which key is which.  The magnetic hold keeping the iPad in the upright position works pretty well, but not anywhere near as well as one could want.  A little too much poke or bump in the right spot, and the whole thing will topple over backwards or the screen will come down on your fingers.  When the keyboard first turns on, it lights up for a few seconds, then the lights go out.  Myself, I think this is a dumb idea, because it looks like the keyboard turned off.  I'd much prefer that the lights stay on, and in the last configuration (brightness and color) that it was set to last.  For what it's worth, this is another one of those points my friend disagreed with entirely.  As for battery life, I did about 11 hours of work, backlight on, with it before loaning it to that friend of mine, who has refused to return it, so I have no clear idea just how much battery life it gets.  I do know it took her three days to ask me for the charger.  Though 11 isn't nearly as good at the 50+ hours other keyboards offer, I'm happy with it.So, fifty bucks (current price) for this?  Uhm, no.  If this were about half that price, it would be much more attractive to me.  With some improvements, yeah, I could see it, but not now.","rating":3},{"comment":"I have been using theBlurex Zierra Backlit Keyboard Case For iPad Airfor the last week and really like it.  This is a really nice addition if you have the iPad Air adding both function, style, and security to your expensive tablet.  The best part about this product is it's ultra slim and ultra-light so it doesn't add a lot of bulk to your iPad Air.First things first, the case fits the iPad Air perfectly.  All ports accessible and the iPad can be popped out of the case pretty easily if needed.  The case features the magnet auto sleep\/wake function and it works like it's supposed to.What makes this case so special is that it features something you often have to look to MacBook's for; a back-lit keyboard.  The light level is adjustable in three different brightness settings and you can even add color for those who don't like the basic white, something even Mac's can't do.  The case comes with a USB cable for easy charging at home and on the go.  When in use, your iPad will be at a slight angle but in most settings this is okay and how I would prefer to have it.Generally, I have found theZierra Backlit Keyboard Case For iPad Air by Blurexto be a good investment for iPad Air owners.  Function, style and a keyboard designed for use during that dark flight, what more could you want?[Sample Provided For Review]","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a nice keyboard case for the iPad Air. It is slim at under 5\/8 in. and weighs about 13.5 oz. (353g). One cover is a matte-finish aluminum and the other is black polycarbonate with a good quality protein leather easel hinge&#8212;it even has that &#8220;new car&#8221; leather smell.The iPad easily pops in and out of the case. The magnet holds the cover firmly closed and it turns on automatically when opened and easily establishes a Bluetooth connection.The keyboard is, of course, miniaturized to fit the iPad, but it is close enough to full size that it only takes a few seconds to get used to it. The keys have a nice matte finish and all the special function keys expected.The keyboard also has a very unexpected feature, however: LED backlighting with three brightness levels and a rainbow of colors to choose from: blue, green, red, aqua, pink, yellow, and white! This makes it lots of fun to use.Instructions are printed inside the case if needed on the go and it also comes an intelligible instruction booklet. The LED indicator flashes red when the power is low and green when fully recharged; charging takes just a few hours with the included USB cable.The easel puts the tablet at about a thirty degree angle and it is not really adjustable and that would be my only wish: that it could tilt back just a bit more.Overall, an ideal case to take with the iPad when travelling and a laptop isn&#8217;t needed but a keyboard would be handy for keeping up with emails.A sample was provided for testing and unbiased review.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Blurex Zierra Backlit Keyboard Case provides a great solution to the never ending issue of efficicent text input into a tablet device.  Road warriors needing to create or edit length documents will be particularly grateful.The Keyboard Case arrived packaged very well and was not damaged in any way.  It comes with the charger and a screen celaning cloth.  Upon opening the package, there was a distinct smell.  Not bad, but distinct.  This went away after ten minutes.  Instructions were clear in how to use the product and even printed on inside of case.  The build quality of the case and keyboard is very good and will definitely withstand frequent travel.  The cover is slim at approximately 5\/8 of an inch and at 14 ounces.  The cover is a flat aluminum with a leather (faux) easel hinge.  The magnet holds the cover firmly in place and automatically turns on and establishes a connection when opened.  No additional steps needed once you make that initial connection in setup.  There is also a battery level indicator light indicating when its time to recharge.The keyboard is not a full keyboard layout (of course).  The keys are much smaller, but definitely usable by any measure.  I found myself used to it after a week or so- but definitely not as big as some other brands, most notably the Belkin line.  The keys are backlit, which to me makes all the difference.  I found I type more efficiently when keys are backlit.  There are three levels of brightness and a choice of seven colors.Is this as good as brands costing thirty to seventy percent more?  Definitely not.  However, I found it a viable solution.A sample of this product was provided for consideration (no guarantee) of an impartial review.","rating":4},{"comment":"I have as a comparison the Logitech keyboard which sells for + or - $10 the basic same price range.Things I like better about the Blurex:1. It has a case for the iPad to snap into protecting the back and sides of my iPad. (Logitech has no case for the iPad)2. It has a nice faux leather connecting piece to set the iPad up in the keyboard. (Logitech does not)3. The magnetic base of the iPad mount allows you to place the iPad any angle you want.4. Upon contact with that magnetic base the iPad is then connected.5. It has bluetooth6. Those little touches- it comes with a screen cleaning cloth and charger7. It has a battery indicator (Logitech does not) I really like the battery indicator to know when to recharge.What I don't like as much:1. The key pad. It is not as sleek feeling- the edges of the keys are square versus a rounded easier feel of the Logitech.

This speakers is the smallest bluetooth speaker that I ever have but it's as loud as other speakers.+Pros:-It's small so I can put it in my pocket and bring it with me wherever I go.-The music is clear with high quality-The design is very simple with all in one button that you can change volume up and down by slide and hold left or right, slide left for previous song, slide right for next song. Press down the button for pause\/play, answer\/hang up phone calls.-AX310 speaker also include a microphone that you can answer phone call while listening to music without touching your phone.-It also has an 3.5mm aux input that you can connect this speaker with other device that doesn't have bluetooth.-This speaker has different tones when you turn on\/off, connect\/disconnect, low battery that makes it different from the *beep* sound like other bluetooth devices.+Cons:-I don't know how everyone thinks but I always like speaker with long life battery (10hours or longer), but this speaker can only use up to 5-6 hours continuously with maximum volume, and 6-7 hours with medium volume.-The handfree features of this speaker is great to answer phone call without using your phone, however the quality of its microphone is low, people on the other line always say that they can't hear me. Sometimes I have to repeat many times or I need to switch it to my phone.In conclusion, this is a small but great bluetooth speaker, but it would be better if its battery and microphone improve better.&#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#9733; &#10025;","rating":4},{"comment":"Don't be fooled by the low price point or the small size.  This mini arrives in quality, transparent packaging that let's you know exactly what you're going to get insofar as the looks are concerned, but doesn't require the jaws-of-life to get the packing open like some of electronics I've purchased in the past.  The size is very convenient for storage and usage next to my computer without taking up too much space or having a tall or odd shape that makes it impossible to place under my monitor for easy access.  As far as looks go, it's nice enough to keep in full view on my desk without clashing with the color or quality of my iMac or looking like a cheap piece of junk.Enough about the looks, the selling point of this mini speaker is the sound quality.  Despite the demure size, the AX310 produces a rich, clear sound that doesn't deteriorate as soon as the volume is increased slightly.  I've put the speaker through a good variety of tests in different rooms while I worked on my never-ending DIY list, and the speaker sounded great in all circumstances with a good access distance for the Bluetooth signal and convenience of the access controls on the speaker itself.I haven't used the microphone feature yet, so I can't comment on that feature, but it's nice to have if I ever have a need for it.  Pairing the speaker with my iPhone and iPad was quick and simple, so I'd have to round out my entire experience with this mini speaker as a definitive 5 of 5 stars without a doubt.","rating":5},{"comment":"Connection wise, I've had no issues connecting to a variety of devices over bluetooth or with the included auxiliary cable.I can' really comment on battery life as i haven't used it for more than 2 hours at a time.Volume is pretty good.

It was less than half the price of my Logitech UE.  While the sound lacks the bass of the UE it makes it up in volume and and clarity.  It paired easily with my iPhone and iPad.  If you're looking for a very nice, sturdily build, loud and clear bluetooth speaker that (at the time of this writing) is $36 on Amazon, you can't go wrong here!","rating":5},{"comment":"Good quality for the price.  We were surprised by the sound coming out of such a small speaker.  It obviously doesn't have as rich a sound as a larger, more expensive bluetooth speaker, but has decent quality and volume for it's size.  The bluetooth pairing works well and we haven't had any problems with static or break-ups in the bluetooth signal.  We took the speaker to the beach and kept our iPod in the backpack where it could stay safe and clean, and placed the speaker on our cooler.  It provided plenty of volume and it was nice that we could move the speaker around as needed, without interrupting the music.The speaker comes with a rechargeable battery and a USB cable, and my only complaint about the speaker is that there is no charge indicator light - nothing lights ups when it is plugged in, so you know it is charging.  Nor is there anything to indicate that the speaker is done charging.  If they could fix that one thing, this would be a perfect little bluetooth speaker.  Even without that, for the price I can't complain much.I haven't used the built-in microphone yet for phone-calls, but will update after I've used that feature -- next weekend I'm traveling and have a rental car, so I hope to use this as a speaker-phone for the car.","rating":4},{"comment":"I'm reviewing the educational MODEL: ASUS CHROMEBOOK C200MA-EDU 4GB MEMORY 32GB DISKI come from a 2012 Samsung Arm Chromebook. The Asus is a major upgrade from that. Better build quality, much better screen, better touchpad, as good as or better keyboard. The 4gb memory allows me to run a lot of extensions. 26 to be exact, including Adblock Plus.I use this machine for browsing, spreadsheets, writing, Netflix, Music, Youtube etc. It operates quickly and quietly and smoothly. If you plan on running Linux you might want a little faster cpu. I wouldn't worry about games too much since you probably won't run them on a Chromebook. Don't fall into the trap of specking for them at the cost of good everyday performance and expense. For browsing and general network interaction the Asus Chromebook is as good as my Asus I7 gaming computer. Better actually because of better battery life (11+ hours) and much less weight and the essentially instant on. Also no noise and runs much cooler. All big advantages. Also no viruses, malware, and windows maintenance which is a pain you know where.So I highly recommend the Asus for the reasons stated.Similar Products I Own::Samsung Arm Chromebook (2012)Sansung 550 Chromebook","rating":5},{"comment":"The fact that it states something in specs which few enough read in purchasing, let alone know of is bad salesmanship.

If I may, I would like to contribute my review of the very closely-related 11.6-Inch ASUS C200MA-EDU-4GB Chromebook, which is the model of this Chromebook that is designed for the education market. During my research on the new ASUS Chromebooks, I came upon a very informative article from 06-23-2014, which was written by the superb computer reviewer, Brad Linder of Liliputing, about the education version of this very popular 11.6-Inch ASUS C200MA Chromebook, that is apparently equipped with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of flash storage. Other than having twice the memory and storage of the 11.6-Inch ASUS C200MA-DS01 model that is currently offered by Amazon, the 11.6-Inch C200MA-EDU-4GB Chromebook is an identical device. Because I really value the additional memory and storage with which this device is equipped, I ordered this Chromebook from a third-party seller on 07-04-2014, because it was not offered by Amazon at that time. Now, after having used the 11.6-Inch ASUS C200MA-EDU-4GB Chromebook as my sole computer for several consecutive days, I have come to the conclusion that it is a fabulous portable computer, which represents a tremendous value at its price point of $329.00.Before commencing with my actual review, I would like to briefly summarize the Google Chromebook concept for those customers who are not entirely familiar with Chromebooks and the Chrome operating system. The Google Chrome operating system is a web-centric operating system based upon the Linux kernel, which essentially augments the Google Chrome browser with actual computing functionality and capability. It is a streamlined and minimalist operating system, whose only native applications are the Chrome web browser, a file manager, and an integrated media player. All other programs and applications do not actually reside within the computer, as with traditional operating systems, but, rather, are derived from the web, hence the term &#34;thin client&#34; computer. Chromebooks are heavily reliant on the cloud, which is a vast array of interconnected servers, accessible via the internet, which houses the computing resources of both individual computer users, and large entities, such as corporations, school systems, and government agencies. My personal predilection for the Chromebook as my primary computer is due to its speed, simplicity, and security. By speed, I am not referring to the processor speed, but, rather, the speed with which I am able to set up the computer and get to work. With this new 11.6-Inch ASUS C200MA-EDU-4GB Chromebook, I was literally able to turn it on, connect it to the internet, sign in to my Google account, and begin working in less than two minutes. The streamlined and minimalist structure of the Chrome operating system confers simplicity to the Chromebook, compared to computers that are run by much more complicated and convoluted operating systems. Superior security is derived from the fact that there is no mechanism for viruses and malware to be installed into a Chromebook in any way similar to the manner in which they are able to infect a traditional computer. In addition, the sandboxing technology that is integral to the Chrome operating system, maintains separation between the actual operating system and the applications, protecting against virus and malware cross-infection. I imagine that individuals who have been well-served for many years by computers running on the Windows operating system, or by the elegant MacBook line of computers, would be unlikely to adopt a Chromebook as their primary computer. Similarly, those computer users who have experienced longstanding service from, and satisfaction with, the Microsoft Office suite of business productivity applications, might also be unlikely to switch to a Chromebook. True power users, such as software developers, graphic designers, professional photo and\/or video editors, and avid gamers, would be better served by a more powerful type of computer, that is equipped with at least 8GB of RAM and an Intel quad-core i7 processor with dedicated graphics. However, the majority of the computing public use their computers for more routine activities such as E-mail, internet search, social networking, typing school and\/or work documents, preparing slides for presentations, and organizing and analyzing data on a spreadsheet. The issue of the absolute necessity for an internet connection in order to be able to use a Chromebook is no longer relevant, as Google has developed excellent offline capability and functionality for its most important applications, such as Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive.  Also, in mid-2014, most business travelers now have cellular phones that can function as mobile hotspots, or own mobile WiFi (MiFi) devices, or purchase in-flight internet access from their airline in advance of their flight. Therefore, for the average computer user, the Chromebook represents an excellent choice for a primary computer, or for a secondary computer, or even a travel computer.My analysis of the specific characteristics and components of the 11.6-Inch ASUS C200MA-EDU-4GB Chromebook is as follows:DESIGN\/BUILD: The color of the top and bottom sections of this device is a shade or two lighter than black, almost a dark gunmetal color, with the Chrome logo in the upper left corner of the lid, and the silver ASUS letters in the middle. The texture of the outer surface of the top section is smooth, whereas the bottom of the device has a distinctly gritty texture, most likely to enhance grip and prevent slipping. The keyboard deck is silver, and the keys themselves are black, with silver letters, numbers, and symbols. The build quality is very solid, with no flex. It is thin, with a width of 0.8 inches (20mm), and it only weighs 2.5 pounds (1.15kg). This 11.6-Inch ASUS C200MA Chromebook is a very attractive little computer, with an elegant design and sturdy build quality, giving it a very premium look and feel.CONNECTIVITY: On the left side of the computer, there is the power\/charging port furthest back, then a full-size HDMI 1.4 output port, the USB 3.0 port, a full-size SD card slot, and the combination audio jack furthest forward. Furthest back on the right side, is the connection for the Kensington lock, with only the USB 2.0 port in front of it. There will soon be 802.11ac WiFi capability, which will be installed automatically, as part of a future update of the Chrome operating system. In addition, this Chromebook has Bluetooth 4.0, and an integrated 720p HD webcam. For such a thin and compact computer, its connectivity is excellent.DISPLAY: The display has a glossy 11.6-Inch LED backlit screen, with 1366x768p resolution, a 16:9 aspect ratio, and integrated Intel HD graphics. Actually, I have been pleasantly surprised by its extremely high quality, given the fact that it is a TN panel, and not the preferred IPS technology. In order to keep the cost of the device well below $400.00, this is one of the compromises that was necessary. As expected, the viewing angles in the vertical plane are not stellar, but the viewing angles in the horizontal plane are almost as good as you would observe with an IPS display. That being said, the overall quality of this display is terrific. It is very bright, text is crisp and clear, and color reproduction is vibrant and robust. Colorful websites such as Amazon, Best Buy, and The Verge, are rendered extremely well. In fact, this display actually has the sharp and distinctive appearance of a display with the higher 1600x900p resolution.KEYBOARD\/TRACKPAD: Both the keyboard and the trackpad are truly superb, and they make typing and navigating the internet with this computer a very pleasant experience. The keyboard has the standard Chromebook layout, and the keys are well-spaced, with good key travel. As a result, there is ample room for comfortable typing, with good tactile feedback during key depression. The trackpad is extremely spacious and responsive, and all of the commonly-used multi-touch gestures are smooth and fluid. As a matter of fact, several professional reviewers consider the keyboard and trackpad to actually be the best components of this computer.INTERNAL COMPONENTS: Although not absolutely necessary, having 4GB of RAM in this model of the 11.6-Inch ASUS Chromebook is quite helpful for smooth multitasking when working with multiple open tabs. Regarding its Intel Bay Trail-M N2830 processor with integrated Intel HD graphics, it is important to remember that the primary mission of this processor is to achieve low power consumption and low heat generation, resulting in extremely long battery life, and the elimination of the necessity for a fan system. As a result, this Chromebook has an incredibly long run time, and it remains cool and silent when it is running. Another benefit of this lack of a need for a fan system is the fact that this device is able to be so sleek and light. With regard to the adequacy of the processing performance of the Intel Bay Trail chip, I now have several days of experience using this Chromebook as my sole computer for work activities, and I have found it to be fast and responsive, with no evidence of lagging or stuttering during periods of multitasking with multiple open tabs. It loads web pages almost instantaneously, and always seems to demonstrate excellent performance. However, the most impressive aspect of the performance of this 11.6-Inch ASUS C200MA Chromebook is its truly epic battery life. When performing mainstream work functions such as E-mail, internet research, writing reports and consultations, and preparing slides and spreadsheets, the run time of this computer is in excess of twelve hours, which is absolutely incredible. Please allow me to reiterate the fact that the primary mission of the Intel Bay Trail-M N2830 processor is to provide all-day battery life, with concomitant low levels of heat generation, thus eliminating the necessity for a fan. The Bay Trail chip was not designed for high-level processing power, although, as I have stated above, I have found it to be plenty fast for performing mainstream work functions such as E-mail, internet research, typing documents, and creating slides and spreadsheets. This Chromebook is also equipped with 32GB of flash storage, which is quite useful for those computer users who value having a decent amount of internal storage, in addition to the 100GB of free cloud storage for two years that comes bundled with the Chromebook. Also, I would highly recommend that those individuals who desire even more internal storage, procure one of the SanDisk SD memory cards, either a 64GB SD card, or a 128GB SD card, depending on their anticipated need for supplemental storage. These SanDisk SD memory cards slide almost all the way into the SD card slot on the left side of the computer, they produce a reassuring click when they have engaged with the SD card reader, and they barely protrude at all. They are very thin and unobtrusive, and are an extremely useful modality for augmenting the internal storage of this Chromebook. The other component that is situated within the body of the Chromebook, is its set of speakers, which actually produce very good sound quality, as far as I could tell, when I was taking in the 1999 Lenny Kravitz and Eric Clapton rendition of &#34;All Along The Watchtower&#34; on YouTube.In conclusion, this 11.6-Inch ASUS C200MA-EDU-4GB Chromebook is an absolutely outstanding portable computer, which I believe is a tremendous value, and a great contribution to the computing public. Its standout features are its spectacular all-day battery life, its superb keyboard and trackpad, its excellent capability for performing mainstream computing functions, and its sleek and elegant form factor. I believe that many computer users would be extremely well-served by utilizing this wonderful ASUS Chromebook as their primary computer, or, alternatively, using it as a secondary computer, or even as a travel computer.Best regards, Ken Rodino, M.D.","rating":5},{"comment":"I think the Chromebook is a nice system.  If you are new to computers this system would be great to start with.  I am intermediate.  I need a challenge.  The system is very fast.  The battery life is great.  I have no complaints.","rating":5},{"comment":"I want to first say that everything I write is based on my experiences using this chromebook along with previous use of other chromebooks. Everyone's experiences are different. With that said, I think that at $250, this is probably the best bang for your buck chromebook you can get. I'm gonna break down each aspect of the chromebook down below for people who want more detail.Build & Design: The Asus C200 has an all plastic construction that feels durable. It hardly flexes and feels really solid when held in the hands. The chromebook is light, but it is not the lightest of its class. As of me writing this review, the lightest chromebook I have used is the HP Chromebook 11. The build of this chromebook is definitely top of its class (excluding chromebook pixel) and does not feel cheap at all. The keyboard feels extremely great to type on. The keys are nicely spread out and feel responsive with slight travel on each keypress. The trackpad is smooth and has the same coating as the palm rest. It is really responsive and it handle 2 and 3 finger gestures extremely well. If there is one thing I have to knock on the design is that the lid really attracts a lot of grease and some fingerprints even though it is not a glossy design. It is not a majopr flaw, but rather an annoyance that may bother some.Screen: The screen is 11.6 inches and has a resolution of 1366x768 like almost every other chromebook in this class. It is a TN panel and the colors on it are surprisingly good which is sometimes hit or miss with TN panels. The screen can get bright and you may need to turn it up if screen reflections bother you because this screen is also glossy. If there is one knock on the screen it has to be that it does not have the viewing angles or color reproduction of an IPS display such as the one found on the HP chromebook 11, which is probably the best screen I have seen in a chromebook (excluding chromebook pixel).Performance: This chromebook sports Intel's latest Bay Trail processor and 2GB of RAM. I want to say I was surprised by the performance but I was not surprised at all. Chromebooks are made for the casual person who likes to browse the web, check e-mail, watch Netflix and YouTube videos. This chromebook can almost handle the task without any problems. I say almost because there were a couple of times where I would start watching a live stream on Twitch and after about 10-15 minutes, it would start to stutter and lag slightly. I made sure it was not my internet speeds at home as well as made sure the streamer was not dropping frames while playing the game. It would happen no matter whose stream I went to. Other than the stuttering while watching Twitch streams, it can play a 1080p video with no problems on YouTube. I also wish it had a 4GB of RAM as I have multiple tabs open and those tend to hog RAM but that is a personal complaint that others may not have any problems with. The last thing I want to mention is the battery life which is really good. Asus states a 10 hour battery life which is false. It lasted about 8 hours through mixed usage (watching videos on YouTube, typing a paper for class, reading articles, and checking\/responding to e-mails) over a period of 2 days.Overall, If I could rate this chromebook 4.5 stars, I would give it that rating. The only thing holding it from being 5 stars is the screen having some poor viewing angles and color reproduction, some stuttering on Twitch, and the lid picking up grease, and fingerprints even though it has a plastic design that is not glossy. If you are looking at different chromebooks and had $250 to spend, this is probably the one I would recommend over all the other chromebooks.","rating":5},{"comment":"Just received this chromebook, and have been using it nonstop.Like any other chromebook it boots up and is ready to go in no time. Literally connect to your wifi and enter your google account and you are good to go.The chromebook itself is incredibly light. It is also silent while running. It doesn't have a fan due to the new Intel processor and you literally can not hear a thing when it is running. The screen is sharp and text looks good. It isnt a full HD display but for the money it is definitely decent. The keyboard is surprisingly huge for the size of this laptop. I don't feel that i need to adjust my fingers any differently than on a 15 inch laptop. Considering how small this chromebook is its great to see the size of the keyboard and the trackpad for that matter. The trackpad is a monster for this size and extremely responsive and works great with multi finger gestures.It is very quick as well. Only when having numerous tabs, 12 or more, and hangout chats open did I notice a stuttering with the computer. While i have been using i have consistently had about 5 tabs open with a couple of chats and some music playing and haven't had any problems.Having only spent a day with it i can't comment too much on battery life, but i have been using it pretty heavily for about 6 hours with brightness turned almost at max and the battery life is around 55% still which is pretty remarkable.I will update my review in time with more use of the machine, but right now if you are looking for a lightweight chromebook with a great battery life, keyboard and trackpad you definitely cant go wrong with this one.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a quality machine, beautifully built and loaded with features.

And this laptop has both.LOOK AND FEEL:The laptop has an elegant brushed Silver finish that takes it up one notch.  Turn it on to instantly enjoy the  back lit keyboard.The back lit key board is cool,even when the lights are turned on (And no more have to turn on the lights to do my work.)  There is a touchscreen Keyboard as well, that I hate to use but my seven year old kid falls in love with it.. Anyone who has an ipad, will vouch the touch screen is useful for watching videos.SAFETY:A nice feature of the laptop is when you are walking around with your laptop (or moving ) , it detects vibration and moves the Hard Disk Drive head to safety position . In the course of the life of your laptop, there will be some damage and hopefully this feature protects it.AUDIO : Audio quality is impressive. Very impressive so my wife screams from the living room to reduce the sound. Watch Avatar to enjoy the difference. for 9 out of 10 Users, you do not need any external audio systems. It is not a Bose system nor a home theater, but for a computer , this is very goodRESOLUTION : You have to see it to believe it.

You are going to see an unbelievable resolution that I have never seen before in any Laptops  ( sorry I have never tried a Mac Retina display but going by numbers these laptop crushes Mac book's retina display  2880 x 1800 resolution as in Apple web site). The IPS technology is a fancy word for being able to watch the screen from near semi circle. ( Again popularized by Apple )NICE FEATURES: One TB of hard Drive. It was certainly a deal breaker few years back,but these days it is useless to store that much data on your computer. The USB ports can be used as chargers while the computer is charging, not a deal breaker but a nice to have feature. They have thrown in several freebies like Abode Lighthouse etc, but that again are not biggies.WINDOWS: A Preloaded Windows 8 is the brain of the system, so do expect ease of use and crashes as in a windows System.  As in any windows system, a reboot takes forever.PROCESSOR AND.. AND..: Powerful, powerful top notch products have gone into the computer, an I7 processor ensures you that the computer can be used for many years.  The quality Audio system , AMD Radeon discrete Graphics etc means business. So do you have plenty of USB ports. You are buying a Top notch product.CONS:I am not at all happy with the battery life. This is a biggie for me. Constantly being conscious of the battery life is something I dont want to see after paying lot of money.The Blue Ray Rewritable Drive is messing me up. It is only few days, I put a CD,it played fine but now not ejecting. When I tried right clicking, it keeps saying \"insert a CD\"...... So tried to update Driver software, went to Device manager, right click and say \"update driver software, the screen is a moving green bar that cannot be closed.... sigh!. Finally rebooted and then could open the CD Drive.WHEN TO BUY : If you can afford to wait, wait until Black Friday to save over $200 on this or something similar to this laptop.  If you happen to see this computer in store, there is a good chance you will fall in love with it's pleasing look. But be open for alternative options from Costco or Best Buy who also have very good laptops ( of course I7 processors ) which are lot cheaper.SUMMARY :This laptop is not for everyone.It is not going to make you more intelligent or is not going to improve your stock picking skills. Nor your Monday morning is going to be more pleasant. It is just one good laptop, A commodity. Your experience will be more pleasant and faster if you do watch \/ edit videos or you are a web designer  or play intensive games ( Wherever you need processing power). Unfortunately  most of us will end up using it to check our emails or verify a recipe or find whether that rash on your skin is a skin cancer.","rating":5},{"comment":"Before I lucked out on this through the Vine program, I primarily used a MacBook Pro (base model from June 2012). This is my first experience with Windows 8.1, 4K, and laptop touch-screens, so I was very eager to put it through the paces. After about a week of using this laptop, these are my first impressions.The 4K screen is absolutely gorgeous. Colors are bright and vivid and the screen is incredibly sharp. Unfortunately, this fidelity comes with several costs. First, of course, is the ridiculously short battery life. The second issue is more subtle and may or may not affect you: MANY third-party apps are not 4K-ready. For example, if they were displayed without any adjustments, they'd appear incredibly tiny. Windows solves this by scaling them up to twice their size, but the results are less than desirable. Apps are slightly blurred to prevent them from looking rough and jagged when they're scaled up, but this muddies the colors and generally has an ugly-looking effect. Worse, it seems that it's impossible to turn the blur effect off, and it's even present if you lower the laptop's display resolution to 1080p. Some popular applications that are affected by this include Chrome, Steam, and GIMP. You DO have the ability to turn the scaling off on an app-by-app basis, but doing so almost always leaves you with an application that's 4x smaller than normal. (On a side note, Firefox does support 4K, so I use that instead of Internet Explorer).This laptop clearly isn't designed to be gaming powerhouse, but it fares surprisingly well. Again, though, the 4K screen brings a few issues. While the laptop has a pretty decent graphics card, it still can't run games at a full 4K resolution at an acceptable framerate. The obvious solution is to lower the game's resolution down to something more reasonable (like 1080p), but for some reason a lot of games won't scale up to fit the screen -- this leaves you with HUGE black borders surrounding a very tiny game. I've done some research and it looks like this might be a problem with Intel's graphics drivers, so there should eventually be a fix for it. For now, though, it remains a frustrating issue. Games I've tested that are affected by this include Civilization V and Tomb Raider 2013. StarCraft II and Hearthstone run perfectly on it at 1080p, however, and older games that use DX9 (such as Battlefront 2) don't seem to have any issues. Also, games running at 1080p can typically run smoothly at medium-high settings. (Quick note about Civ V: this one will scale up as it should if you run it under DX 9, but DX 9 forces the graphics to low settings.)The keyboard is great. It feels very similar to my MacBook Pro's, which is awesome. The trackpad is adequate, but it's nowhere near as sensitive or smooth as a MacBook Pro. If you decide you want to use a mouse instead, be warned that the computer's fan vent is on the right side of the computer. This means that your hand will be blasted with hot air whenever the computer's doing any serious processing.Blu-rays look great, though the disc drive seems to be a little bit louder than past laptops I've used. It can be a little distracting, but it's not a huge issue.One other quick note: With the default settings, the sound quality is TERRIBLE through the headphone jacks. Fortunately, this is fixable. (Open the DTS Sound app, click the big power button, log off\/on, and it should be fixed).So is this worth the asking price? Specs-wise, it's a bit stronger than what Apple is currently offering for the same price tag. Compared to the midrange $1499 retina MacBook Pro, this has a slightly higher-fidelity screen, 4 GB more RAM, a more powerful processor, a dedicated GPU, and a very nice capacitive touch screen. That said, I just don't think that 4K is widely supported enough to justify the pricetag on this yet. However, if for some reason you really need the 4K screen and you know that the apps you'll use will support it, then this laptop should do the job more than adequately.Four stars.","rating":4},{"comment":"My experience with the Toshiba Satellite 15 Inch has so far been excellent.The speed of the machine and the screen quality are mind blowing compared to everything that I have used.The laptop came preinstall with windows 8.1. To my pleasure there was not too many apps installed that usually tend to clutter the system.- The system is very quiet (no fan noise even when doing cpu intensive task like video conferencing).- The keyboard touch is pretty nice.- Trackpad is ok, I always prefer to use a mouse so I am not the best judge- 4k screen is great. I have not much room for comparison but sure beats all my previous experience with non 4k display- I have used this system very casually so far but haven't used any application that could have needed more horse power- 3x USB3 ports should satisfied most casual usersTwo wishes- A little lighter (I guess this is what you get for a large screen)- SSD would be welcome instead of standard hard drive","rating":4},{"comment":"Hello there,I'm a mac user but know Microsoft Windows since the \"MS-DOS Executive\" and do know Macs since the first ones with bluish displays and that wonderful thing (at that time) called mouse. Know about CP\/M, Unix System V and good old clicks from a metal made IBM PC\/XT keyboard and the CGA color display flickering, I also remember the very first touch screen I've ever touched... The HP 150 (circa 1983).And there's more, I remember when my dad gave me my very first computer: Sinclair ZX-81. I couldn't believe it!!! I was dreaming about writing a software that could take me inside the computer like the Tron movie did while wondering if 1k of memory should be enough!!!. That was a dreaming 8 years old little boy who has always loved technology. That was (and is) me!The reason I bring all the above memories to this review is... Technology now is lacking passion... and now you can have toys that you can use, you can enjoy but you won't love. Yes, you can find a very small bunch of tech giants that sparkles with innovation, experience or design but... for the rest... they just don't listen!!!I do like the Windows 8.1 experience. It is pretty fast, pretty stable and looks modern...the Toshiba P55T-B5262 which is named after a fax machine is good. It is a pretty good laptop with impressive capabilities but an even more impressive list of possibilities. This laptop falls short on design. It is not that it has been badly made... not by any means but it could be a lot better with a little bit more imagination.I reckon it is very hard to fight in the computer business today with the commoditization of the PC but who's fault is that? How much money does the best industrial designer could cost?... Is that much for a corporation? That very question brings me to what I don't like from this laptop:While Toshiba made a good effort in the materials choice for a good priced high end laptop, they felt short in ergonomics, for some reason I can't really point my finger to, I feel a little bit uncomfortable while writing this review (I'm using my brand new Toshi here) and it is not a keyboard fault because I have to say, the keyboard is pretty good, it is like if the track pad was in the wrong position or has the wrong size. I beg you pardon for my imprecision but there's something wrong here and it is not the keyboard. Another minor critic is the fonts used on the keyboard, I think those fonts makes the keyboard to look unfairly cheap,that's the problem when you get too used to a Mac obsessive attention to the details.On the other hand, there's the screen. Impressive I really have to say the screen is. I have to congratulate Toshiba on this one. It looks so good I can only tell a little bit more brightness could be great but... I can't disqualify this display. If you're in a not so bright room, it beats the retina display I have on my Mac Book hands down.The audio... hoooray... Those Harman guys sure know how to make things sound pretty good and maybe the size of the laptop, gives room for a little bit more audio than thinner ones but, the fact is... this thing really sounds good. I do like the sound experience and while it could use a little bit more volume, I also have to say that might be just me because I'm a little bit deaf myself. Too much Walkman\/Diskman\/Minidisk rock in the 90's and iPod in the 2000's I guess :)The trackpad... just rubbish...beggars belief... I seem to find this kind of rubbish quality track pads everywhere. I had an Acer S7 Ultrabook and that one was even worst. Do they think just because they give you touch screen it can have very bad pads? Toshiba please, I think it has the wrong size or is in the wrong place but that could be only me... but really... get some firmware upgrade from your Synaptics supplier... Or at least ask for more control on the track pad panel... I'd love to be able to disable it.. it is that bad.Now what I like the most apart from the lovely, mesmerizingly good screen and the surfaces touch feeling and the sound is the ability to have not two but four 3.0 USBs (or at least I hope they are 3.0 because they are blue :)), and Ethernet port and an HDMI port on board.As mentioned before, I still prefer my Retina MacBook Pro because of the way it makes you feel but by that said, I'm being a little bit unfair because I've paid twice as much (plus $300 for applecare) for my Retina so it is easier to have better everything (except the display) at twice the price... don't you think?My verdict, this is a rather impressive little fella (well not THAT little anyway) featuring on the positive side:- Impressive display. I mean it... it is very good. The best I've seen since the Retina display and even more impressive for it to be touch.- Good performance and playing with photos is a breeze.- Keyboard besides the look, is very good.- I like the idea of having that numerical keypad.- 4 USBs, 2 on each side.- Blu-Ray Reader, DVD Writer. Which is very good indeed but, having those 2 USBs on each side is very convenient to connect mySamsung SE-506BB\/TSBD 6X USB2.0 External Slim Blu-ray Writer Drive (Black)when I have to write a Blu-Ray disk.- Good surface feeling. We are talking about some aluminum surfaces here, not only cheap looking plastics and that feels good at the touch and makes the laptop to look better.- The 12 GB of RAM and the 1TB Hard drive.- Did I mentioned the screen?? ohhh... lovely and it's touch!!!- Another thing I'm noticing while typing this review, the screen seems to repel finger prints pretty cool. I have to try it a little bit more but.. somehow I've been playing with the touch and it does not looks like painted with grease crayons... cool right?- I do have to congratulate Toshiba on including almost no bloatware at all... Good for you Tosh... you deserve a High Five!!!The bad:- The Track Pad... ooohhh boy is bad... not the worst I've ever encountered... that title goes by far to the Acer S7 I had last year.- I find it falls a little bit short on ergonomics and I don't know why but... I think is the size and\/or position of the useless track pad. don't know for sure.I like this laptop very much, it is a wonderful value for money and you won't be disappointed if you look at it as a tool... but I wanted to love it, I wanted it to bring back the boy in me... and it didn't. That is why it has only 4 stars and not 5.Hope this helps!JP","rating":4},{"comment":"Just looking at the stats before I recieved the Satellite P55T, it looked pretty impressive. Good enough to handle most games, definitely enough to use for work.So, when I got it and openened it up and started to fiddle with it my estimation was right. I ran some games on it and it runs Tribes, WoW, Titanfall, Wolfenstein, Skyrim and a few others on it and it worked great. I think if you like gaming you could make this machine work for you, if you also needed it for general use and work.I work from home and my job requires me to have several apps open at the same time and it is able to handle it very easily. Also the screen is so clear and crisp I can read the data I'm working on a lot easier. Batter time is less than advertised though, I get about 2.5 hours tops and gaming you have to be plugged in or it will drain faster.The has a sort of stainless steel look to it as well which is appealing and it has a full keyboard with 10-key pad which is great for work. The Windows 8 with a touch screen seems to work great on this machine, though I don't find myself using the touch screen that much. Still, the touch screen works well and maybe after I get more used to it, it will be something I use more. It just seem awkward to me to use a touch screen on a laptop vs a tablet.The only downside I see in this machine is that it gets hot fast when using more resource intensive things like games. I have not had problems with it bogging down when it gets warm or having it shutdown on me or anything like that but something I will keep an eye on.All in all with the i7 processor, 12gigs of RAM, a solid grahics package and excellent screen make this a very nice all-purpose laptop.Update 07\/02: I'm finding a couple of less desirable issues with this laptop now with more use. First, the fan is pretty loud on this particularly when playing games. Second issue is that battery life is clearly not close to what is advertised. I have been using it for work which involves running a few apps at a time and I typically listen to the streaming music at the same time. So far I have been getting less than 2 hours on battery power alone from a full charge. However, performance is great otherwise!","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a beautiful computer with one pitfall.  The touchscreen is virtually useless. I am still trying to figure out why it is so difficult to get it to respond.  At first I thought a proprietary stylus might be needed and I was overlooking it. After much research I have figured out no way to get the touchscreen to respond appropriately.  It is hit or miss and when it does respond a hard jam is needed to get it to work.  Now on to the plusses.  The screen resolution is fantastic and the sound is crystal clear.  The keyboard is outstanding, it lights up when in use, the feel is great and it is comfortable for different sized hands (I had 4 people try it).  A two finger  touch is the same as a right click  on the touch pad and you can  swipe the screen using the touch pad also.  Battery life is as advertised and the machine held the battery charge for four days when I did not use the computer. I am happy with the computer but the touchscreen problem is one that needs attention or consumers will be returning this machine. I have read the manual and it is helpful.","rating":4},{"comment":"I am very pleasantly surprised at how much I love this laptop. About three months ago, I bought a different Toshiba (the Satellite S55-A5359) and although it was ok, I was not as impressed as I am with this one. I won't get into it, because I wrote a review on that one already. But I will cover a couple of comparisons.First of all, let me say that setting up this laptop was a million times quicker than the other one I just bought. Of course this one is Windows 8, and the other was Windows 7, so maybe that was a factor. I want my rating to reflect the laptop though, not the operating system, because Windows 8 is Windows 8. Nonetheless, I still love the ease and speed that came with setting this up. You basically turn it on and the instructions couldn't have been more user friendly! I hope that is helpful for those of you new to Windows 8.Now I'll get to some of the actual characteristics of this laptop. First and foremost, the display is a-MAZ-ing! I do a ton of work in photoshop, but I never thought I'd be this excited about a display, I thought the one on my other Toshiba was great. But when I turned this on, I knew even before putting them side by side, that this display was top notch. I took a photo of my flower garden, and loaded the exact same picture on both laptops to make sure I was comparing apples to apples. Not only is this one better when looking straight on, but it still looks great no matter what tilt the screen is at. You know how most screens have to be tilted just right in order to not be washed out, or too dark? Well this display doesn't degrade at all, no matter what angle you're looking at it from. It's so nice when my husband is looking over my shoulder at something on the screen...he doesn't have to tilt it so he can see! Basically, you can tilt your screen till the cows come home and you'll still be looking at sharp, clear, vibrant graphics.Ok, a few other great things I love...the speakers sound pretty awesome for a laptop. Not like my high end stereo, but very, very good! Another thing I love is the touchpad. I have had issues finding the sweet spot on my other Toshiba. But this one is very responsive, no matter if you are right clicking, left clicking, or moving the cursor arrow, it is a breeze. That's pretty important to me, because my touchpad on the other laptop is very fussy.The touch screen works well too, but I don't use it much. I honestly prefer the keyboard and touchpad. Which brings me to another subject....I have an external mouse that I sometimes use when at my desk. I decided to plug in the usb portion of the mouse to use it with this laptop, and I swear that mouse was working within two seconds! It didn't even go through the 'found new hardware' thing. I plugged in the usb, then reached for the mouse, and it was already working!As for my internet connection...that was of course a breeze too. The laptop found it right away, I clicked to enable it, and that's all it took. Also, startup times are lightening fast. When I start it up from a complete shut down, I get the password screen within 5-10 seconds. I enter the password, then my desktop is up and running within another 5-10 seconds, including internet access. I only mention that, because I had major issues with my other laptop....but again, there is a separate review on that one.Bottom line, I really, REALLY love this laptop. I did receive this computer in exchange for my honest review....so I guess the million dollar question is this: Is it worth the advertized price, (which is almost twice what I paid for my other laptop)? For me, the answer is.... if you can at all afford it, yes it is definitely worth it! Especially if photo or video editing is important to you! And if any of you are like me, and not sure about trying Windows 8, let me say that this is my first go at it. Although there is a small learning curve, I'm finding that I really like it. If you are at all used to smart phones, kindles, or other devices that use icons rather than menus, you should have no problem with this.I will end with one final comment; this comes with Adobe Lightroom, but I prefer Photoshop. I have use lightroom off and on before, and never could see how it excels in any way. Photoshop can do so much more in my experience. I even like Photoshops simpler version, 'Photoshop Elements\" better than Lightroom. But that is just my humble opinion. I would suggest trying the included 'Lightroom' and judge for yourself.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have been buying Toshiba's since the early 90's and have always loved their laptops.  This year I was looking for a laptop with a larger screen for streaming entertainment and I wanted some extra oomph in the chip.  I also really wanted some nice sounds.  I am not a computer whiz and so this review comes from the point of view of someone who is a frequent if not very well educated user.This laptop has an attractive brushed chrome exterior which feels nice to the touch and does not show fingerprints like my old laptop.  The screen is huge!  Great for viewing films and YouTube.  The keyboard feels great--not sure how to describe it but it feels like effortless typing.  I like that it is lighted too.  The duration of the keyboard light, after nonuse, can be adjusted in computer settings.  The touchpad has very positive feel.  I don't like the touchpad situated to the left as opposed to the middle.  Makes it unbalanced in my lap when I use it. However, this is a common feature in current laptop design so I am will not make it lose points for this.It's taking me a while to get used to Windows 8, which I wanted to hate, but I'm trying to give it a chance.  The touchscreen is a mixed blessing, for one I do not like fingerprints on my display!  Windows 8 has changed things around and makes it harder for me to find things--for no good reason that I can see.  A lot of things I have had to get used to.  I really did not want to resort to a tutorial to learn how to perform functions that I already know how to do on the older operating system.The performance of the Core i7 chip is lightning fast.  The graphics are beautiful and the picture is crystal clear.I LOVE the sound system on this laptop.  Very high fidelity, despite the small speakers.  I can actually hear bass, although not as much as with larger outboard speakers.  It's a pleasure to watch YouTube on this computer.  It also has a dvd\/cd slot which a lot of computers seem to dispense with these days.I'm not impressed with the battery duration--but I usually end up buying a more powerful battery for my laptops because I like at least 4 hours.  I think it lasted around 2 hours which is okay.  So far, it hasn't gotten hot on my lap yet.All in all I think it is a really nice computer.  I like it a lot but I am not in love.

Installed neatly in my Dell inspiron 13z-5323, perfect height at 7mm.I did not clock boot times or perform any other speed test, however the increase in boot goes beyond noticeable. From power on to the login screen went from 30 seconds to doggone warp speed; the boot options F2 and F12 only show up for a blip the process is so fast!The longest part of my boot was after logon taking upwards of 2-3 minutes and take mere seconds anymore.That said I did spend a considerable amount of time to setup since I wanted the original DataSafe restore partition intact.First, i tried the utility from western digital to clone the disk; it is actually an acronis true image software and did not clone correctly leaving a slightly larger recovery partition. This in turn made it not able to boot since the MBR table is specific to the partition size.Then I found easeus partition manager that is free for personal use. With this program I was able to select each of the three partitions and clone one at a time using sector by sector copy and optimize for SSD. while taking considerably longer at 4 hours it was well worth the time as I still have the factory restore installed and is recognizable by Windows.I have much more to test such as installing office, but google sketch works without lag as does multitasking with other programs while the hard drive is busy.","rating":5},{"comment":"My MBP 17&#34; was purchased in fall 2010 and I removed the DVD and added second drive, so I was running 750gb and 500gb , my 750 (Segate) died on me so I replaced it with a 500gb SSD, what a difference in speed!

I previously had a 240 GB Monster Digital Daytona SSD in my MacBook Pro. I never had any problems with it, but was always a bit skeptical about it. The whole line of Daytona drives was discontinued after a bad run of 120 GB drives that ruined the brand. I have emailed Monster Digital&#8217;s support several times after a firmware upgrader they provided did not work on my system, and never got any response back from them. Needless to say I never was able to update the drive&#8217;s firmware, and that worried me. Monster Digital&#8217;s support stinks, I would never get their products again.Crucial&#8217;s support on the other hand is pretty good. I chatted with one of their representatives from their website after I installed the MX100 and he was helpful, knowledgeable, and quick with my answer. It&#8217;s good to know that Crucial&#8217;s got my back!Before installing the Crucial MX100 SSD, I cloned my MacBook Pro, placing the drive in my StarTech dock and using Carbon Copy Cloner to copy OS X, and Winclone Pro to clone the Boot Camp Windows partition. I didn&#8217;t use the downloadable Acronis software that Crucial provided, but I use Acronis to backup my Windows partition and have never had any issues restoring from it.  The cloning took a few hours, but I just went off and did other things. I tested the drive, booting from the hard drive dock, and everything was fine, so I went ahead with the install.Installing the Crucial MX100 SSD is quite simple on my late 2008 MacBook Pro. This model has a removable battery, and the hard drive sits right next to it. Before beginning, I would recommend that the battery be removed and AC power is unplugged from the computer. Touching a metal component inside the case will discharge any static electricity. All that needs to be done is to pop off the battery cover, unscrew the hard drive bracket, and unplug the existing hard drive. Using a Torx screwdriver (which can be bought here on Amazon or at a local DIY store), the 4 screws on each corner of the old drive need to be removed and screwed into the 4 corners of the new drive. These hold the drive into place on the chassis. Then, plug the cable into the new drive, seat the new drive in place, screw down the hard drive bracket, and replace the battery cover. That&#8217;s it, then turn the computer on.I didn&#8217;t notice that much of an improvement in boot up speed over my old drive, but keep in mind that was ALSO an SSD. Going from a standard mechanical hard drive to a SSD is a night and day improvement. It is much, much faster. I do see some speed improvement when searching the web. Pages definitely load a little quicker, and I would say overall performance on my MacBook Pro is a little bit faster. I also noticed a considerably faster shutdown speed as well.The Crucial MX100 SSD is a great drive. I highly recommend it. Now, I feel a bit more secure about the drive that is in my laptop. Just remember, no matter what, always back up your data.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is my step-by-step guide on how to upgrade your MacBook or MacBook Pro (you cannot easily replace the hard drives on MacBook Airs). First be sure to check through the different sizes on the hard drives because sometimes there is not a big price difference for larger hard drives. For example at the time of writing this the 256GB version is only $30 more than the 128GB version. Doubling your space for only $30 more should always be done.The 128GB hard drive really might be too small for a lot of us now that everything is digital.  But the 128GB is an option if you don't plan on having a large music collection and whatnot.  I generally recommend to my clients\/friends\/family start at 256GB. If you're working with video or have a semi-decent digital video collection and you will need the 512GB hard drive for sure. I'm sure glad the SSD hard drives and finally dropped in price so that there semi-reasonable in price.If you're somebody want to upgrade your MacBook or MacBook Pro I'll walk you through the steps necessary to get that done. (Apple MacBook Air are not user replaceable sorry)This is the EASIEST way to get your computer up and running all the while protecting your data. (This method requires a USB external enclosure but they can be had from anywhere between $8 and $15 on Amazon and are well worth the purchase).Sabrent USB 3.0 To 2.5-Inch Sata Aluminum Hard Drive Enclosure1. Install your new SSD hard drive into the external enclosure2. plug-in your external drive into your Mac USB port.3. Hold down the command key and press the R button on the keyboard once you boot up your Mac. This will load the recovery partition (most Macs have this invisible partition, now if you're running an older version of OS X that doesn't leave a comment to this review and I'll try and help)4. Go through the installation process for new install of your operating system but install the new OS on the external drive. **You should see two drives to choose from** (This will take a few hours and may require Internet connection so be ready and you may need to log in iTunes to verify your account)5. once the install is complete walk through the initial set up and you get to a window asking if you want to transfer your old files from a previous OS X install.  Say yes and what it asks for what hard drive tell it to use the data from your old internal hard drive.  this process could take up to an hour or more depending on how much data you have i.e. movies and music etc.  Finish up the installation until you see your computer up and running.Note: Basically what you have now is your old hard drive data & files cloned onto your new SSD hard drive inside the external case.  so both hard drives are now mirror images of each other and your data is safe.5. after install is complete removed the newly formatted external drive and install it in your MacBook or MacBook Pro. Installing new hard drives into MacBooks is not difficult But be sure to Google it before beginning this endeavor to make sure you feel confident you can complete the job.

Once you've installed your new hard drive in your MacBook put it all back together (alternately you can just plug in the power just to verify that you're all set which if you're new to doing this I recommend it) and turn it on. * Unplugged the external USB hard drive for now*7. The MacBook should boot up to the new internal hard drive and all your data should be preserved.If you run into any problems you're all set because you have an exact duplicate on the hard drive you just extracted from your MacBook.Now I'd recommend at this point verifying all your data and settings are correct; which in most cases I am 99% sure if you follow these instructions you'll be all set. Install your old hard drive into the external hard drive and plug it in. At this point you want to start Time Machine and do a full install to your external hard drive.I hope this helps this is the method I use all the time for installing new hard drives in my friends\/family\/customers computers.

In terms of value, the MX100 leapfrogs every other SSD and takes a comfortable lead out of starting blocks.  In terms of quality, Micron has been a major player in the SSD market for a number of years and have always received high marks for reliability.  I have no doubt this drive will carry on that tradition.  Put all of those qualities together, and you have an all-around winner of a SSD that will propel Crucial to win back some market share in a market that has recently been dominated (for good reason) by Samsung.","rating":5},{"comment":"I've always had good luck with Crucial memory and their SSD drives are solid performer.

Downloaded the included software and got the password to activate the software, formatted the SSD, then cloned my 500g hdd onto the SSD while I watched a movie.  Came back from the movie, removed the HDD, and the SSD booted into W7 in perhaps 10 seconds.  The cloning also copied two other partitions that were on the HDD.As noted by others, the performance improvement is impressive.  According to the Windows 7 performance index, the disk read\/write speed is now rated at 7.6, instead of it's previously paltry 5.8 with the HDD.  The weak link is now the laptop graphics (6.1), but that's more than enough to run any games I run with decent speed.I haven't had a chance to check for laptop battery life just yet -- I'm expecting some improvement there too.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have M4's and M500's and never had an issue.

No kidding, VMs boot up about 8-10x faster.  People who edit crazy large video files may want to spring for something more expensive and higher performance, but for 99% of people this drive is the perfect mix.Even if you have a brand new machine, replacing your spinning HDD with this drive is a huge upgrade well worth the cost - my little Mac mini now runs almost step-for-step with my top of the line MacBook at work.","rating":5},{"comment":"Replaced a 1TB SSHD with this 256GB , the Acronis cloning software is worthless on Win 8.1 which cost it a perfect rating.

The majority of our current hard drives are standard Western Digital and range in size from 250GB to 1TB. Recently we switched to and began using Seagate drives (Seagate Backup Plus 2 TB USB 3.0 Desktop External Hard Drive STCA2000100) and have been quite pleased.  However, standard drives while large in storage a slow in speed compared to SSD's.  Therefore we're always excited to add a solid state drive to our main gaming desktops.  Here are my thoughts on the Crucial MX100 256GB SATA 2.5&#34; 7mm (with 9.5mm adapter) Internal Solid State Drive CT256MX100SSD1;Pros+ Blazing fast data transfer.+ Extremely compact size.+ Usable in both laptops and desktop computers (mounting kit may be necessary if you move your desktop).+ Full computer boot up in mere seconds.+ Affordable ($110 at the time of writing this review).Cons- As with most Solid State Drives you have to sacrifice storage for performance.- I experienced some performance\/crash issues when the device was becoming too full with my movie\/music media.  Once I transfered it off this device I never had the issue again.The &#34;Crucial MX100 256GB SATA 2.5&#34; 7mm (with 9.5mm adapter) Internal Solid State Drive CT256MX100SSD1&#34; is the third Solid State drive we've owned.  Our first SSD's were theOCZ Technology 60 GB Vertex Plus Optimized Edition SATA II 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive OCZSSD2-1VTXPL60Gwhich we sadly had to replace multiple times with the manufacturer due to repeated data corruption.  I'm happy to report that I've had no such issues with this Crucial SSD.  My computer boots up lightning fast and every game I've run on the drive so far has played without any hitching, stutter or lag (poorly coded games not included).  I have this drive in a desktop that I never move so the drive is actually hanging loose but you can purchase a mounting kit for around $5+ on various computer tech websites.  This is the first device I've owned from this manufacturer and overall I'm very happy with the &#34;Crucial MX100 256GB SATA 2.5&#34; 7mm (with 9.5mm adapter) Internal Solid State Drive CT256MX100SSD1.&#34;  I would easily recommend it as an operating system drive.  If you don't mind sacrificing storage in order to gain system performance then this drive would be a good investment.","rating":5},{"comment":"For those on older Macbook and Macbook pros, I just installed the SSD on a late 2008 unibody Macbook and it was a quick and easy install. I can confirm this was compatible and installed at SATA II at 3GBps link speed. Works incredibly quicker for loading up applications (less bounces) and quieter.I was considering buying a new Macbook Air but Apple charges a premium of $500 for additional space for going from 128GB to 512GB which is a ripoff.I also installed the old 500GB hard drive into a Superdrive drive caddy and works as a nice internal storage area for photos, music and movies.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have been using Crucial&#8217;s m550 model for a while and very satisfied with it. It has not been over a year yet, but I am not noticing decreased speed or lagging.This one, according to my quick research, is the world first 16nm SSD with MLC (256 GB version) and still offers low per GB price for the majority of consumers. These days I am seeing fast decreasing in SSD prices (especially 240+ GB ones), and I found this one go around or under $100 when offered with a mail in rebate. Having said that, I think, this is good time to try on the SSDs if you haven&#8217;t. The short booting time, incredible reading and writing speed, makes the whole personal computing experience very different from the spindle drives. I already swapped my main drive to Crucial&#8217;s m550 in my Macbook Pro, so I put this one as a second SSD (replaced ODD using cheap data doubler). During the process, I had no issues, and the drive is now working hard very quietly. Now my MBP is cooler and quieter than ever, and I love the fact that I have enough storage space in my laptop with the fastest speed and low power consumption (less heat).The box comes with a 7mm to 9.5mm spacer and a key code for Acronis True Image HD 2014 application. Also, this drive includes 3 year warranty which is good enough for the life of the SSD. FYI, the endurance of this drive is rated at 72TB TBW(total bytes written), and that&#8217;s equal to 40 GB \/day for five years.Overall, this is still very good SSD, only the writing speed lags little bit compared to the some others. However, this SSD offers efficiency and affordability for the mainstream personal computing consumers. Around $100 for 256GB SSD is really good buy and worth try now. Probably in three years, these might get dirt cheap, but for now, this is the affordable and reliable SSD solution.","rating":4},{"comment":"I works and was a good deal.

He swears by it. When the smaller version became available, I grabbed it and had him install this for me on my computer.He is right, it is faster booting up than my traditional drive. It is super quiet because it has no moving parts and that also makes it faster. I don't worry about bumping my computer, or my cats bumping my computer and causing me problems. It even feels a little cooler without the traditional drive. That's very nice in the summer, trust me.Now 256GB is a bit small, but for my needs it works.Only time will tell if the drive is as dependable as my old traditional hard drive, but Crucial has a long history with these drives and everything I and my husband have read indicate they are sturdy, dependable, and a good value.My husband and I are not into running diagnostic tests to see how fast, or how durable something is. There are enough people who do this testing that repeating does not make sense. About the only hassle one could expect is to maybe update the firmware if needed and even there Crucial has made this simple from their support site. The only other hassel was needing to wait a bit of time under OS X for it to see and fully recognize the drive. Once OS X did recognize the drive and allowed it to be partitioned, the drive worked and worked very well. Sorry, that is past tense. This drive WORKS very well and I look forward to it working very well for a long time.Bottom line, I would recommend this to my friends and family who may need to replace their hard drive or want something that is faster and quieter.Rebecca Kyle, June 2014","rating":5},{"comment":"I love the product and Micron.

I gave up some space for performance, but it wasn't being used and (anyway) I have a 2TB external USB3 drive if I get back into large video files.

Silly me to think I could have gotten by with only 60GB for a boot drive on a Microsoft system.  When I bought this, I had less than 2 GB of space left and performance was significantly affected.  I was worried that I'd have to reinstall everything, but pulled the trigger anyway.I did not know that this product comes with a free version of Acronis, which was amazingly helpful with creating a full bootable backup of my old SSD, which I then restored to the new SSD.  In all, the whole process of migrating to the new SSD, including downloading and installing Acronis, creating the system backup, installing the new SSD, restoring the backup to the new SSD, and removing the old SSD took less than 2 hours.The only hang-up I experienced were in the step-by-step instructions from Acronis on completing the backup and restore.  Apparently their help files are a bit outdated (i.e. screen shots and menus reference a previous version of the product, not their current version which has slightly different screens and menu options).  Once I figured this out, I was flying through the process.All in all, this was an easy, smooth process, with zero issues.  When I did the final re-boot to the new SSD, I was holding my breath, concerned that I would still have to end up reinstalling everything...very relieved to see Windows load successfully.  I've had zero problems with the drive since installing it and performance has returned to what I'd expect of an SSD.  Of course, now having 422GB free space on my boot drive means room for lots more Windows Updates, and a few programs loaded on the boot drive, if I'd like.","rating":5},{"comment":"So far no issues.

My machine is an early 2011 MacBook Pro 13\" and it is super fast now.One thing I would mention is that I originally cloned my old drive to the new Crucial SSD.  The performance was VERY disappointing, so I did a fresh install of software on the SSD and whammo, it is so very fast.  Yes, I am having to reinstall a lot of software, but who cares?

It&#8217;s corded, which I prefer since cordless mice are usually troublesome with regard to maintaining a connection and having to recharge the battery. This is a traditional USB corded design that works very well.The cord is braided, which is a great feature since it helps ensure the cord doesn't get hung up or pinched in use. Very well done.The mouse itself is comfortable, with well-sculpted sides for comfort. The two buttons on the right are easy to find with your thumb, have a nice click to them, and have raised dots to help keep your finger from slipping off. The scroll wheel is similarly well-made, with a smooth feel and slight indents when used for fine-tuned movements. The DPI selection switch is right behind the scroll wheel for easy access.  DPI selection is 800\/1200\/1600\/2400.Note that this is for right-handed use only (sorry lefties!).Zero problems with installation (plug and play) on a Win 7 machine.Misses are mainly on two issues: build quality and the casing. The build quality is pretty lightweight. While it&#8217;s working fine at the moment, the build quality doesn't give me the feeling that this would survive much punishment, such as being dropped on the ground. It has a more cheap feel than my Logitech mouse.The casing is a plus and a minus. A plus in that it is a rubberized-type coating that offers good non-slip benefits. But it&#8217;s a dust and dirt magnet, and the rubberized coating makes it hard to clean. I would have rather seen a smooth surface with isolated grip points that are rubberized, rather than the full mouse.The misses knock it down to 4.5 stars, but I&#8217;ll round up given the overall attractive look and excellent performance. Well worth considering if you&#8217;re looking for a corded mouse.[Sample provided for review]","rating":5},{"comment":"Tested this high quality AZIO Gaming Mouse on my HP Desktop and found it to be very smooth and responsive.And I am very impressed with the high quality!First I will say that I am NO GAMER and am currently using this mouse as a high precision everyday mouse and it is great for this.I also brought this to a friend&#8217;s home who is a GAMER and we tested it together RESULTS:+ DPI is plenty fast enough for moving the screen across the screen without having to move your who wrist\/hand.+ This mouse is both smooth and fast and not jerky.+ Makes a combo game mouse and everyday mouse.+ Testing this &#8211; My friend and I both tried this as a regular mouse and it worked well even superior to a regular low DPI MOUSE.

Super easy to set up and figure out how to mount a camera, the tilting head means I can get shots up or down or follow my dog. The tripod is light but sturdy, great for carrying around but safe enough to trust with my camera.The rubber feet and spikes make this useable on concrete or at the beach. The carrying case is nice and has a handle for easy handling.sample provided, opinion my own","rating":5},{"comment":"This tripod is pretty tall and with full sized tripods, tall is a good thing.  It is 50\" with the center column all the way down (where everything is the most stable) to a maximum length of 70\" with the center column all the way up.  It actually goes up a bit further and I'll discuss that in the \"Monopod Section.\" Even fully extended this tripod provides a stable surface thanks to it's rock-solid materials and design.  By contrast, myManfrotto 190XBis only 46\" tall with the column down and 60\" with it up all the way.You get two level gauges.  There is a bull's-eye bubble level at the top of the tripod to help set the legs properly.  There is a tubular level on the tripod head set the camera tilt.  Between the two, it's easy to make sure everything is properly aligned.  That is very important if you are shooting videos to prevent people from \"getting shorter\" as you pan the camera.The tripod head works equally well with video and still cameras.  It has an extended panning handle to make camera movements more fluid.  The head tilts on a hinge as opposed to falling into a notch like many tripods designed primarily for still cameras.  Again, the goal is to help make camera motion more fluid.  Finally, the quick release plate has a stability pin designed to hold video cameras in alignment.A nifty feature is the built-in monopod.  Remember when I said the center column extends 20\"?  (OK, I didn't say that exactly but if you do the math that's how it works out.)  Well, if you keep lifting, the center column comes away from the tripod and that, it turns out, is your monopod.  It has extending sections, similar to the tripod legs, which allow it to expand to the advertised 58\".  This means you can move quickly from a fixed tripod position to a more mobile and still stabilized monopod in seconds without having to detach your camera.  Returning your camera back to the tripod is just as easy.At nine pounds, this tripod is a bit heavy for today's standards.  That is partly because it is made of metal and partly because of the extra metal needed to make up the imbedded monopod. However, that additional weight contributes to its overall stability and in my mind is a good tradeoff.  Also, with its attached carrying handle and ability to fold to a compact size and fit into the included carry bag (which has a shoulder strap), moving it around isn't a problem.I was sent this tripod so I could have an opportunity to use it and write a review.  After using it for a while I have to say that it is a lot of tripod for the price.","rating":5},{"comment":"Why pay a photographer each year for your holiday photos when you can set up something anywhere you want, anytime you want, and at your own comfort while your whole family feels more relaxed--put the camera on the tripod and set the remote.On special occasions be sure you entire family is in the photo, or simply make sure every photo is professional and steady.Get into your video fun or photography fun the right way and the professional way.This one is made so well and does so much--the tripod even turns into a monopod.  The height is higher than many and easily adjustable.You adjust with simple flips of the knobs so even on a hill, the back feet can be higher or lower than the front to make your shot steady and perfect.Tripod provided by Ritz.","rating":5},{"comment":"I am a filmmaker so I spend a lot of time cursing at tripods, but I'm falling in love with this one.  I am using it to replace one that cost three times more and has been annoying me endlessly.  Here's what I think is most important in a tripod - the checkmark means that this Ritz Tripod has it covered:&#8730;  Thumb-tabs, not twist release for the leg-locks- This makes set up\/break down so much fasterand allows more accurate fine setting of the legs.You'd be surprised how many expensive tripodsuse twist locks, which are fine if you set up yourtripod and leave it, but if you move your tripod todifferent locations often it's just an annoyance.&#8730;  Adjustable pan & tilt-  Many lower priced tripods have simple locks forpan and tilt... they are either locked or they're not.More expensive tripods allow you to adjust thedrag on both which lets you create very smoothpans or tilts at any speed you require (this is avideo thing and not really relevant to still photos,but since almost all cameras shoot video now,features like this are becoming more importantto still photographers.)&#8730;  Lightweight&#8730;  Sturdy&#8730;  Has a handle (yay!!!)The thing that strikes me the most about this tripod is that it is essentially a pro-level tripod that has been manufactured from plastic rather than metal.  So, it has all of the features that pros look for, but because it's plastic, it's waaayyy cheaper than a pro-level tripod.  Is the plastic construction an issue?  Only if it's taking a beating everyday.  I probably wouldn't use this on a commercial film or video shoot because the crew tend to be very hard on equipment, but when it's just me going out this is a great tripod to grab because it has the features I need without the weight.If you are looking for a good tripod that's a step up from the crappy, cheap ones, and that has a lot of professional features without the high price tag - this is a good one to consider.","rating":5},{"comment":"For me, I am really like photography, yet I am an amateur in photography. Before I tried out this tripod, I tried two (used ones) that were gifted to me and they worked OK yet were not that well made and just plain wore out! Here is what I like about this tripod:1) Stability - What I really like is the the tripod legs have spikes in them so I can safely anchor this tripod in a grassy area or even on the beach &#8211; this is an added plus for great stability!This Ritz Gear tripod I found stable, easy to setup, carry around and use.Personally, I believe it is great for the amateur photographer or even the more professional one.2) Weight \/ Carrying Ability &#8211; This tripod weights 4.2 pounds and I found it easy to carry in my car and it was not too heavy or bulky to setup.3) Durable! This is my third tripod and bar far the best that I have ever used and I give this tripod a full 5 stars![Provided to me for testing and review purposes]","rating":5},{"comment":"I've been a serious amateur photographer since 1970, and since then, I've worn out at least 3-4 tripods and monopods. When the Ritz Camera folks asked if I would review a new Ritz Gear tripod for them, I was very happy to oblige, and hopefully, I could retire the old tripod I've been using for the past fifteen years or so. After using the Ritz Gear tripod for a few days, I have to say that I like it very much, and my old tripod is now packed away in the garage.The Ritz Gear tripod has a lot going for it. For one thing, the 70&#34; maximum operating height is greater than most tripods in this price range. I measured the maximum operating height at 54&#34; with the center column down, and 70&#34; with the center column up. With the center column up, a photographer would have to be well over six feet tall to have to bend over, and with many older people, that's a real selling point. The tripod was remarkably stable even with the legs fully extended and the center column up.Speaking of the center column, it can be lifted out of the tripod and used as a monopod. Unlike most monopods, though, it has the Ritz Gear's tripod head and all of its features. The monopod's height measures 23&#34; with its leg retracted, 47&#34; with the leg fully opened and locked into place. The tripod's carrying handle can be popped off the center column and snapped onto the monopod if desired. Both the tripod and the monopod are finished in a matte-black color, which won't reflect enough light to draw attention to you while you're shooting.Let's take a look at the tripod head. The quick release mounting plate has a butterfly screw instead of the kind of screw that needs a screwdriver or coin to tighten (thank you for that). The locking lever fits against the tripod head where it would be very difficult to accidentally open. The three-way pan head is pretty conventional, so its operation will be intuitive to anyone who's ever used a tripod. The bubble level is an essential feature for keeping the horizon level, and it's especially helpful for shooting stitched panoramas. There's also a circular bubble level on top of the tripod base.The tripod legs have small spikes for setting up on soil, but the rubber feet can be rotated to cover the spikes for setting up on pavement or indoors. The uppermost 4&#34; of each leg is covered with a foam padding that gives a good gripping surface. When you're not using the tripod, retract the legs, fold them up, and slip the tripod in the weatherproof carrying case.At just over four pounds, the Ritz Gear tripod is about as lightweight as any 70&#34; tripod that I've looked at. I imagine that some of the carbon fiber tripods are a bit lighter, but not by too much, and they're a lot more expensive.Okay, the Ritz Gear tripod isn't a Giotto or one of those other very expensive big-name brands, but it will definitely get the job done for me, and I think most amateur photographers would be pleased with it, especially for the price. It has just about every feature that I need, it's sturdy enough to hold any camera and lens that I own, and it looks to be durable enough to last for many years.A product sample was provided for evaluation and review purposes.","rating":5},{"comment":"Samsung's Galaxy Tab S is a premium piece of hardware at a premium price. Let's get this out of the way quickly, is the screen quality better than what you will find on an iPad mini? Sure, they both have wonderful screens, but Samsung's screen is better (boasting a higher resolution). But when I looked at my iPad mini side to side with the Samsung, I couldn't detect a difference in terms of pixelation. But I do find the Samsung screen to be more colorful and bold. But I find this with Samsung's phones, as well. Again, you would be hard pressed to find a better screen. Couple the screen size with the form factor of this tablet, which is just right to fit in one hand comfortably, Samsung has a winner. I found myself going to this for reading, the screen giving text just enough pop and space that I didn't find myself needing to increase the text size out of necessity.The screen and its weight appear to be optimal; there is a lovely balance to what's inside this tablet. It feels level in your hand, and sturdy without sacrificing its lightness. Samsung, stealing from its own design on their line of phones, has given this tablet the same backing as the S5 (well, the dotting is spaced a little bit further apart. The backing doesn't make this a fingerprint magnet, lovely. It also gives it a nice tactile feel against the fingers and palm. The quality with this table is evident. The buttons, off\/on, volume, while not being recessed are built close enough to the frame that they are not a hinderance to the palm while holding the tablet or to the fingertips when they need to be utilized.How does the tablet perform? And what about content? On both fronts Samsung has decided to beef things up. The tablet has a great if not excellent processor. You can multitask till your fingers cramp and the processor won't even bog you down in the least. I don't know why I want more power behind this tablet when it goes pretty hard in that category. I detected no hiccups in performance when running videos, or streaming. Also, when I loaded up a bunch of files, and pictures, they were read quickly off the micro SD. I'm using a 64, but this tablet can hold up to 128. Samsung has also decided to provide its own bits of media. \"Bits\" might be the wrong word, there are some hearty chunks with Samsung's Papergarden. It's Samsung's way of offering low prices or free content to owners of the tablet. It is also Samsung's way of trying to get you to not even think about an iPad or Apple's ecosystem. Will that work? Depends on what you want to get out of your tablet experience. I find myself loving the openness of Android.Samsung has crafted an awesome tablet. The form factor is ideal, just feeling extremely natural for one handed use. At first, this tablet may seem underwhelming. But that may be due to how natural it feels, nearly an extension of the hand. I felt from opening the box that I was using something familiar but experiencing something new.","rating":5},{"comment":"I bought this tab on a whim.  I went to BB to trade in an old tablet in exchange for a $50 gift card.  At the same time they were offering another $50 coupon towards the galaxy tab s.  I figured that was a good deal.  What the heck.The tablet is feather light, and very thin.  I like the plastic back very much and am not paranoid about it getting scratched up the way I am with my iPad Air.  The plan for now is to use a screen protector on it without a case and see how that works out.  I'm really tired of putting my phones and tablets in cases that ruin their svelteness and design.  On the other hand there are some excellent cases out there for the tab s that allow you to set it upright so I might be inclined eventually.I mentioned that I had an iPad Air and I do love it but I also have always preferred Android phones to iPhones.  I think it is friggin ridiculous the number of hoops I have to jump through to get music, videos and other media onto my iPad.  I ADORE that with this Android tablet I can load up the sd card with almost any format of music or video and it works out of the box.  That rocks!But my enthusiasm for the tab s is tempered somewhat. While I dislike iTunes, I think iBooks is fantastic (as is garageband, but that's another story).  I have not been able to find any Android e-readers that come close to the smooth operation and beautiful design of iBooks.  It's really disappointing.  Even the kindle app isn't as sexy as the iOS one is.  Why don't these e-readers for Android perform animations like page turning well?  That might sound like a petty complaint but the animated page turn allows you to peek back at the previous page to remind you of what you just read, or to preview ahead.  In a ebook it's impossible to thumb backwards and forwards multiple pages the way you might with a real book, so this limited maneuverability is important for me.  I don't get why android e-readers don't do it.  UPDATE: I have tinkered more with Moon Reader  +, FB reader, and others, and have discovered more functions and customizations.  They might be adequate.  But they just plain do not look as good as iBooks or Kindle of for iOS.It seems to me a lot of apps for android still haven't been successfully modified to fit the tablet design. A lot of them look stretched out or only fill up half the screen.  You never see that half-baked crap on iPad apps.  Even going to google news defaults to a mobile setting that just lists the items on the screen without any design or thoughtful layout (yes I know you can go to the desktop version).I've had samsung phones in the past and got really tired of touch wiz.  All that bloat, all that lag.  I have an lg g2 phone now and its skin is so much less invasive than samsung's and frankly the features are more useful. (For example, when I copy text, I have several \"clipboards\" where text is stored and I can choose among them--why isn't that universal?)  Getting the tab s reminded me of just how imposing and \"thick\" touch wiz can be.  I like some of the features and customizations, but I wish others like \"S Voice\" would just go away.  I could similarly do without the \"Paper\" magazine reader.  How nice would it be to just have a google play edition of this tablet?One exception, I tried out the samsung Milk music app and it's great!  It is similar to iTunes radio or Pandora, in that you create a \"station\" based on an artist and they try to guess what you will like....that part seemed ok but what was really great was that it was commercial free!  For how long, though, one wonders....The sound quality from the tab s was decent.  I could listen to music on it for an extended time with no problem but headphones would better. I used the Rocket music app to browse through my collection and it the sound was good and the display of the album art was fantastic.Also I have never used the multi-window function other than to play around with it but I think Samsung has got that pretty much down.  It looks promising for say, watching espn watch on half the screen and chatting with a friend on the other half.Other observations, I think the fingerprint sensor works GREAT, maybe because I was expecting it not to.  I didn't think that was going to be a feature I cared about but it really is a convenient way to unlock the device.  Not sure I'll use it all the time but I'll be traveling internationally next week and will certainly have it on the whole time.  Only caveat about the fingerprint sensor:  the tab s begs to be used in landscape mode but you have to hold it vertically to effectuate the fingerprint swipe.  No big deal though.The camera, meh. UPDATE: yes the camera is still meh, but there is a very cool function where you can voice-activate the camera or video recorder by saying \"capture\" or \"record video.\"  That is handy for sure for selfies or the videos I often make of myself performing music.A tip about lag: all samsung devices have a lag when you press the home button below the screen.  That's because it is waiting to see if you press it a second time to activate S-voice.  You can go into the settings of s-voice and get rid of that double-button activation and voil&agrave;, the lag is gone.It's certainly nice to have an sd card slot, but the file managing features leave a lot to be desired.  In only 24 hours I have grown extremely frustrated trying to use the \"my files\" app to navigate through the sd card.  Sometimes files are displayed according to location, other times they are displayed by date.  I cannot figure out how to change the settings.  I downloaded an app called ES file explorer that works much better.  The dropbox app is probably the easiest way to access media and documents but, alas, there are times when we don't or won't have wifi access.Someone complained about the screen being too vivid.  He was ridiculed for it but I agree completely.  I turned off the \"adaptive display\" which accentuates certain images and colors (I guess) in favor of a \"basic display\" and now it's more subdued and provides less eyestrain.Anyway, this tablet seems great and a lot of fun.  The display is second to none, the lag is minimal (more than the iPad though), the sd card is a great feature, and the whole unit is incredibly light and well-designed.  The experience of reading and annotating text, both PDFs and epubs, falls short of the iOS experience with tried and true apps like iBooks and Goodreader.  I'll stick with it though!","rating":4},{"comment":"Great tablet, I love this thing. Excellent replacement for my Nexus 7. I would write more but ther is already a wealth on info in the reviews.

Micro SD card support up to 128 GB.Cons-1. The tablet comes with a lot of bloatware.2. No S Pen support.3. Camera is mediocre.I have managed to get my hands into the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 for the last couple of weeks. I was very excited to give it a try when I saw the Samsung announcement. I have to say after a trying it out for some time I can honestly say I am impressed. Below I will give you my thoughts on the tablet.Pros-1. By far the most compelling reason to buy this tablet is the display. It looks really amazing. It has top of the line resolution of 2560 x 1600 giving it 359 pixels per inch. But it is not the resolution that makes the display so unique but the Super AMOLED technology that creates bigger contrast in colors. Colors look saturated and slightly unrealistic but there is no denying they look great. At the end I think it is a matter of preference, if you like the display of the Samsung Galaxy S5 then you will certainly like the display of the tablet. You can tell Samsung made this particular tablet for content consumption. Everything from pictures, videos to magazines look very impressive.During sunlight exposure the display has to be cranked up almost all the way up for you to read comfortably. I noticed that videos look better in direct sunlight that previous Samsung tablets I have used. I put my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 (2012) model tablet side by side and it just pales in comparison.2. This tablet is one of the thinnest and lightest tablets in the market. It is even lighter than the IPad Retina Mini and that is certainly saying a lot. In terms of weight it easily rivals 7 inch tablets. It weight the same as the Nexus 7 (2013). Keep in mind the Nexus 7 screen is only 7 inches as opposed the Tab S 8.4 inch display. I can easily hold the tablet one handed for extended periods of time. In terms of weight it is as close to the Amazon Kindle E-reader as I experienced. As far as the outside of the tablet is concerned it is made of the exact material and texture of the Samsung Galaxy S5. It is plastic but it has a soft, very comfortable dimple back that does not collect fingerprint. Not as nice looking as the IPad but a great improvement from previous generations. Besides that plastic back is what allows the tablet to keep the weight down.3. The Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4 is considered a high end tablet and it has the specs to back it up. The Wifi model that I have been using has a Samsung made Exynos 5 Octa core processor. Four of the cores are running at 1.9 GHz and four cores running at 1.3 GHz. It also comes with 3 GB of RAM memory. What does this all mean? That it can handle just about everything you can throw at it and more. The processor in this tablet is designed for optimum performance. In my time using the tablet I have not discovered any slow down at all. Multitasking works incredible well. The only thing I did not like was the Samsung Keyboard. I personally do not use it because it tends to lag. Instead I installed the Google Keyboard. It performs much smoother. The rest of the interface however is fluid and smooth. Games open very fast and browser performance is better than ever. I have absolutely no complaints when it comes to performance.4. The battery in the tablet has a capacity of 4900 mah. Samsung claims that the battery life is for 10 hours of web use. On a typical day after using it to catch up on morning news, listening to some music, a couple hours of Netflix and YouTube I still go to bed with around 40-50% battery. That is with the brightness at a little less than half. One day I was reading outside and decided to crank up the brightness all the way up. I lost about 20% in an hour. Games also tend to use the battery faster but that is to be expected. For normal everyday use you should have no problem getting through your day with it.5. Android has a lot of different locking method for your devices. I feel that other than a long password the safest way to lock your device is by fingerprint. The fingerprint scanner in this tablet is the same model found on the Galaxy S5. You have to swipe your finger across it as opposed to the one in the IPhone 5S where you only have to place your finger and it unlocks itself. I found the fingerprint scanner to be more accurate than the one on the S5. You still have to be careful how you swipe the finger but it fails less often than on the Galaxy S5. You have the option of using several fingers to unlock the device that way more than one person has access to the tablet at all times.6. The tablet supports Micro SD cards up to 128 GB in capacity. This is great because the tablet itself only comes with 16 GB of storage built in which is lacking in today&#8217;s world. I myself use a 64 GB card with the tablet and there I have been able to store over 10 movies, over 1000 songs and a few hundred family pictures. The Micro SD cards now a day are cheaper than ever and they provide so much flexibility. It is a real convenience and I am glad Samsung has decided to support its use for so long.Cons-1. If you have ever used a Samsung Galaxy phone in the past you know they usually come with a lot of prepackaged apps. That is not the exception here. It comes with a TON of Samsung apps. The vast majority of them I have not even touched until this day.2. One of the things that bummed me out a little bit about this tablet is that it doesn&#8217;t support the S pen. The S Pen is useful to take notes and to make drawings and it has been a staple of Samsung tablets over the last couple of years. I have a feeling they did not included because the S Pen might not be compatible with the Super AMOLED screen.3. You can clearly tell that manufacturers just don&#8217;t place much emphasis on the camera for tablets. Even though the Galaxy Tab S is a premium tablet the camera looks more like one found in a mid-range phone. The camera on the back is 8 MP. That is above average for tablets but is not really anything that will impress you at this point. Photos in good sunlight came out fairly good. Indoors and at night the pictures looked grainy and you had to be really still for them not to get blurry. The same performance was seen during videos. The camera has no image stabilization therefore you have to have a very steady hand or else the video looks very shaky. I can&#8217;t really say I am going to be using it much. The front facing camera is 2.1 MP and it performs as well as you could hope for. It is all right for the occasional Skype call but nothing too spectacular. It is average.Overall, do I recommend this tablet? I whole heartedly do, especially if you are looking to use it for entertainment and media consumption. The display is fantastic for movies, pictures and reading. The design of the tablet itself is very thin, light and comfortable to use. In terms of overall size and weight the tablet is rivaling the 7 inch models from last year. The exclusion of the S Pen makes this tablet not the best in terms of productivity. If you are looking for productivity on a tablet maybe the Samsung Note series might be a better option for you.I hope this review was useful and I will be looking to update it in the coming weeks.If you are still unsure whether to purchase this tablet go to a local retail store and see for yourself. Compare it side by side with other tablets once you take a look at the display and the overall aesthetic I promise you will be impressed.","rating":5},{"comment":"Having a Note II i always wanted a tablet with the same screen and this is it. Nothing technical i can say that hasn't been said by more knowledgeable tech people. The only downside i found (for me) is the bloatware you can,t remove  and the lack of an Amazon Prime app for android.  For that i must keep the ipad mini.  With that screen it would be fantastic.But if you want to transfer old pictures from pre digital era, they show very badly, or an old video from tape. Forget it. It didnt use to happen with other tablets. Must be it doesn't &#34;translate&#34; well to amoled.Put a 128 gb card, downloaded tons of things for long flights. Being so thin and light is a joy to use and carry. Very happy with it.","rating":4},{"comment":"I had the Tab Pro 8.4, but Itched to get the new Tab S 8.4. I have to say I am very disappointed.Laggy, more bloat, no Knox app1. Screen - as with most, or all other super amoled displays, this unit's display is problematic in the sense that it is pinkish (based on my own personal experience, which some people also complained about in forums), just like my Note 2! S4! and Note 3! Yes I am an Upgradeholic, and I suffer from Upgradeitis... on my handsets that I mentioned, they all had pinkish displays, and they all had darker bottom half, specially the S4 which I had replaced  under warranty because it was so annoying especially at night when I am reading. The Tab Pro 8.4 does not have this problem.2. Memory (RAM) - I thought the 3gb was good on the Tab S, but the unit is preinstalled with more bloatwarez than the Tab pro, and what makes it worse is these bloatwarez cannot be stopped from running so they occupy a lot of the memory and running in the background unnecessarily. Waste of memory space and battery.3. Processor - Maybe this contributes to the lag on the Tab S, because the octacore is not yet properly implemented maybe, can't really comment on this, but I don't trust Exynos. They caused problems on the earlier Galaxy S3 and Note 2 where the phone has random reboots then eventually shuts down and won't turn back on within the first six months of use!...  google up S3 or Note 2 Sudden Death Syndrome  so you will know what I am talking about. This happened to my previous phones, and I consider myself the luckiest bastard in the gadget world.4. Knox - I have used knox on my Tab Pro 8.4 and I like the security because I use my tablet when travelling, but the Knox container is not included with the Tab S, but they somehiw replaced it with more bloatware.5. Build\/size - the Tab Pro 8.4 is a little bigger, but the fake faux leather finish is better than the plasticky band aid like back of the Tab S. They are both plastic but fantastic! Both very light but the Tab S is even lighter.6. ROOT - if you do not know about this, then just ignore it. This is for people who do habitually do it to their phones\/tablets to boost performance. I am not planning to root my Tab Pro 8.4 because it is not that bloated and runs smooth unlike the Tab S. I also don't want to loose Knox...Now, if you plan to root your device, then you can potentially make the Tab S run smoother by debloating it, tweak processor speed, etc, but be aware that exynos chip is not as widely supported as the chip on the Tab pro which means no or limited Ready cooked ROMs from developers.To those who have the Tab Pro 8.4, you are lucky to have it instead of the Tab S 8.4, you are really not missing out. To those who want to buy either unit, it's your decision to make, but you have been warned...Good luck!=========Edit:Here is how I check my devices' screen.1. Go to playstore and download Dead Pixel Detect and Fix by Chaming Studio2. Go to a dark room and open the app.3. On the bottom of the app, clock the \"colors\" tab and a new pop up window will open, choose each color and carefully check for dots\/pixels that are not the same color with the current displayed color. Black is a dead pixel which cannot be repaired, while other colored pixels like white, are stuck pixels and may be repaired.4. Now on the darker half screen that I mention, choose \"white\" or \"grey\" color and look for variances on your screen. Some have pinkish tint, while others have yellowish tint... goodluck!=======Edit: it looks like some people got butthurt because of my review, well let me say the Tab S 8.4 is a tad smaller and lighter which I like,and I like the new style keyboard on it (it looks like the keyboard of the LG Tablets.","rating":1},{"comment":"If Samsung wants to convince someone who never owned a tablet to buy one, or someone who has been using  iPad and wanted to upgrade, this tablet comes as close to the better choice as ever been.  While I think it is hard for a long-time iOS user to switch to Android, the Samsung Galxy Tab S could be the one to switch or additional tablet device you want to get.I will not attempt to evaluate Android 4.4 here, as there are more qualified people who can do that. If you are used to iOS operating system it is unlikely that you will switch platform because of the latest Android.  If you are used to Android in your phones or other Android tablets, congratulation! You now have a tablet device choice that is far superior in term of physical features and technology than any currently in the market.  The iPad Mini Retina (which I own) is in the same price range but doesn't even come close.This tablet is a joy to use.  Watching a high definition video on this tablet is a whole new amazing experience. Colors are richer and pictures are so sharp you could not believe it can get to that level. Playing the same video side by side with the iPad Mini retina or iPad 3 and you could tell the differences. The iPad 3 used to have the best screen in all tablets, but no longer. Next to Galaxy S, you would think it is almost dull and boring.  I have heard of AMOLED , now I am totally convinced this is the new standard for tablet devices. Playing a video is as easy as clicking on the video file to play it after setting the default player the first time.The Galaxy Tab S comes with only 16GB or 32 GB, but you can add an additional of 128GB of storage via a microSD slot on the side. There is not many 128GB microSD card available and still expensive, but with 64GB card, you could get to 80GB of total storage. Total cost: $440 versus $600 for a 64GB iPad mini retina and $699 for iPad Air. Adding a 128GB microSD card (around $120) is still cheaper than a 64GB version of either above iPads.My Nexus 7 is only $220 but hardly belong in the same league. Nexus 7 has no rear camera, no storage expansion option and drained the battery so fast I have to charge it twice a day! A Nexus on full charge, leave in idle, would be dead in about 2 days. So on battery consumption, the Galaxy Tab S has about the same performance as the iPad's .The camera app in the Galaxy Tab S is far superior to one on the iPad. There are several modes to chose from, most interesting is Dual Camera. You could imprint the image of the front camera to one taken by rear camera! How cool is that?? Image quality is about the same, but of course they look gorgeous on another level when viewing on the Galaxy Tab S.The Galaxy Tab S is thin and light. So thin that I constantly worry that I would drop it.  There is no cover\/case for it yet and I hope the future cases have cut-outs for the tablet's stereo speakers. They are located on the side of the tablet, I constantly cover them with my fingers!I am sure Apple will come up with something clever, hopefully in the same price range to stay competitive. Right now, this table is the reigning king of all tablets due to it price range, features and  most importantly, it gorgeous screen.7\/1\/14 update: WiFi performance on the Galaxy Tab S is superb; I streamed the same Nextflix movie to the Galaxy and iPad's side by side and the Galaxy really shined. While the iPads continued to buffer and finally gave up and displayed the movie in standard resolution, the Galaxy played the movie in HD with no hick-ups. I guess I could run a speedtest to have better data,but based on this I am not sure I need anymore proof. If you use this tablet mainly for surfing the web, watching streamed movies or playing videos, this tablet is the one to get!!","rating":5},{"comment":"Excellent tablet I would put the screen 5\/5 build quality 4\/5 software 5\/5 cpu 4\/5 battery life 3\/5 camera 4\/5 I was previously using a ipad mini retina that i bought brand new from apple back in november the best tablet I have had but their were things about it i didn't like the lack of a SD card slot and a closed os android is more like windows much easier to download video files from websites and download torrents what this tablet can do that I really love is it can install apps on the SD card you can even move apps from the hard drive to the SD card something I have never seen on a non windows tablet if you have a otg cable you can connect a usb flash drive not only that but you can move copy files to and from the flash drive and create folders on it without having to root the tablet or download a app those things I could only dream of doing on my ipad the only thing about this tablet I don't like is the battery life as long as you don't spend a lot of time playing games it will be OK that's were I really liked the iPad the battery life was always great build quality I think is nice but not great not on Parr with  ipad it's light has narrow bezels which I really like the cpu is good does a good job running games it does stutter sometimes but not to the point when it's gets annoying overall it runs pretty smooth","rating":5},{"comment":"I have been looking forward to this Tab S 8.4 since it was first announced that it was coming out and now that I've been using it for the last few days it is fantastic!  I am a huge fan of Samsung tablets.  I have the Galaxy 2, 3, tab pro and 4.  I must preface this review by saying that I'm an older, retired women.  I am not very tech savvy, but I have learned to use tablets by trial and error.  The Samsung tablets just keep getting better and better in my opinion.  The AMOLED screen is amazing!!  It is so clear and bright, the colors are very bright and vivid.  Reading text is wonderful.  The tablet itself is as light as a feather, I can hold it for long periods of time without any fatigue or cramping of my hand or arm.  It is very fast and smooth.  Set up took less than five minutes.  WiFi connected immediately and all my info synced in a matter of seconds.  I use it for email, Web surfing, games and watching movies and TV shows and it is fantastic.  The keyboard is very nice, very responsive and easy to use.  I can't say enough good things about it.  The battery is also very good.  I went through the apps and either Uninstalled or turned off the ones that I won't use and I turned on the battery saver.  There is also a battery super saver, but it turns the screen to black and white and I wasn't crazy about it so I'm using the regular saver.  I have been using the tablet for 2 days of heavy use and the battery is at 38%!  This is my new best friend....it is perfect!  With Prime it arrived in 2 days.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for either a new tablet or a replacement!!","rating":5},{"comment":"Overall, I like this tablet, but I have a few concerns. I have both android and apple products, and I'm not loyal to either.  I have an ipad 2, and I've been heavily researching tablets for the last month or two because I would like something smaller with a better quality screen. This tab s has a beautiful screen, expandable memory, split screen capabilities to run two apps at once, perfect screen size (portable but not too small like the 7\" tablets I looked at), and nice options to customize (something I miss on my ipad).  The fingerprint scanner works great. The gold bezel on the white model is really tacky. I was planning on getting the simple case from samsung, but now that I see how bad the gold looks in person, I'll be looking for a case that completely covers it. I've also had problems with lag and reloading in the email app. When I click on some emails, it will flash the picture twice, pause to reload, and pop me back to the top of the email when I've already scrolled down. It's extremely irritating and something I don't experience on my ipad or kindle hdx. I called samsung support to see if something might be wrong. The tech support person remotely accessed my tablet, had me remove my email accounts and re-add them, and also checked a few other things. Nothing helped. After doing all of this trouble shooting, she then told me it was my network. It's not. My other tablets are fine. Then she told me it was normal. Which is it-a problem or normal? And how should that happen on such a top of the line tablet? Then she later told me google is working on an update to android that should fix the problem. Story #3 as to what's wrong. I don't have the greatest faith in samsung tech support now. At any rate, I'm hoping it's just something defective with my unit, and I'm getting a replacement. I'll update my review if the replacement is better.UPDATE 7\/14\/14The replacement tablet is also having issues with the email app.  On top of the issues described above, it is also adding white lines through some of the e-mails (they don't appear on the ipad). So, I decided to have a Samsung rep from best buy look at it (they do free troubleshooting of minor problems there no matter where you bought your Samsung tablet). Shrinking the font size to the second smallest setting got rid of the white lines. They think the blinking\/reloading\/scrolling issues are with the email app and certain senders. They added the yahoo email app, and it doesn't have the issues when I view the messages there (the yahoo app is very, very fast-faster than the native email app). Long story short, I either have to deal with the issues to have a combined inbox in the email app or use two separate email apps (and the gmail app is very, very slow for me). I've downloaded a couple different email apps from the playstore to try to get a faster and smoother combined email inbox, but so far I haven't found one I love (if you have a suggestion, please tell me!). Personally, I didn't like the over saturated look of the adaptive display (makes skin tones, among other things, look very unnatural). So, I changed the display setting to basic, and I prefer that. I purchased an ipad mini with retina 32 gb for a bit cheaper than this tablet, but comparing them side by side, I think I'd rather deal with the issues of the Samsung tablet for the sake of the screen. The ipad looks really washed out next to the s tab. I also prefer the customization options with android. As a final note, in case it helps any of you who also have carpal tunnel, the email apps I've used on the s tab are easier on my arm (my carpal tunnel radiates to my elbow) because you can scroll from the bottom of the screen rather than having to lift your arm every time to touch the buttons at the top of the screen on the ipad. In the end, I'm keeping the s tab and returning the ipad mini.","rating":4},{"comment":"First Look: Hands on reviewRating 4.5 Stars (Excellent Tablet but not a perfect 5 star). Unfortunately there is no half rating with Amazon so I went with a 4There is no question that Samsung has flooded the market with tablets in the past year. From low range to upper range.  When the Tab Pro 8.4 came out a few months ago I knew that was the Android I have been waiting for. Of course had I known the Tab S was coming out I would have waited for this tablet.  That takes nothing away from the Pro because it is an excellent tablet and I assume there will be further discounting.  I broke up my review into sections so you can jump to a section faster.DesignThe Tablet S comes from same design as the S5. The corners and edges are rounded. The back cover has the same dimple pattern and is plastic. Samsung has been criticized for the plastic; however, I like the design and believe the tablet will stand the test of time.ScreenThe screen is stunning.  I love the screen on my Pro 8.4; however, with Samsung using the AMOLED screen with the same 2560x1600 resolution as the Tab Pro the colors just pop.  The blacks are deep.  Watching HD video on the Tablet S is a joy.  Everything you may have read on the Internet about how beautiful the screen is true. Of course there is the downside, there are not many applications finely tuned to take advantage of the whole display. My assumption is this will change in the coming year or two as the better resolution is the norm on Android hardware.  Looking forward to when you can watch Netflix in HD on this tablet, which should be coming soon according the launch Samsung did.CPU\/VideoThe Tab S Wifi comes with the 5420 octo-core Exynos 5 Octa chipset (quad-core 1.9 GHz Cortex A15 + quad-core 1.3 GHz Cortex A7 CPU).  The Tab Pro 8.4 has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800.  The Tab S or Tab Pro have not had any issues with any app or video I have thrown at them.Storage and MemoryWhile Samsung did announce that there will a 32GB version of the Tabs S, they have the 16GB at the writing of this review. While 16GB keeps the entry price of high end tablet lower it does leave you with a little over 10GB space, which is somewhat disappointing.  The bloatware is typical with most manufacturers. Yes you can add up to a 128GB microsd card but unfortunately many applications do not allow you transfer to SD.  The microSD is perfect for pictures, videos, and large documents.The Tab S gained 1GB of ram over the Tab Pro. 3GB vs 2GB.  The TAB S has no issue running the most demanding games or if you multitasking in split windows.Boot up and restart times.If you have any of the older Android tablet, you know how long it can take before you can start using the tablet.  These are times I recorded for the Tab S to get to the login screen.- Power on from a powered off state. 22 Seconds- Restart - 28 seconds- My Tab Pro recorded 24 seconds and 40 Seconds.  To be fair on the restart, my Tab Pro already has more apps installed on it which may have impacted the restart timeConnections:The Tab S is stocked for the future. The Wifi card supports Gigabit Wifi.  I do not have ac router so I cannot test the throughput. I will eventually upgrade my router once I do, I will test the throughput.The Bluetooth is 4.0.The Micro USB connector is only 2.0.  USB 3.0 would have been nice and would have added to the premium tablet. I do not believe I will using the USB connection other than some bigger transfer from time to time. Normally I do wifi transfers.GPS, The Tab S has GPS. if you plan to use the tablet as a navigation you will need to use an app that allows to have offline map capabilities. Of course if you have a mobile hotspot then you could get away with the need of offline mapsWifi Direct - Allows to connect to other wifi direct devices. I have not tried printing or sending a video to the TV but I connected to my computer to transfer filesColorThe bronze color of the tablet S is nice. I am not completely in love with the color but I know others will love the accent colors on the tabletThicknessThis tablet is thin. To give and idea on how thin the tablet is, I put the tablet on the table and stacked quarters next to the tablet.  The thickness is equal to four quarters.  There are two connectors on the back of the tablet that for the Samsung case to attach to.  They look out of place if you do not have case on the tablet.Size and WeightThe 8.4 S I believe is the perfect size for portability and usability.  I can easily hold the tablet S with one hand and because it less than 1 pound you can hold it for a great length and not have fatigue.CamerasDo not expect to replace your normal camera or even your phone camera with the camera on this tablet.  While the back camera is 8MP, it does not perform well unless you have a large amount light.  Yes you can use the built flash but it is too harsh and washes out the picture some.  When you have the light the pictures come out good enough.The front camera is 2.1MP.  I ran a Skype session between my Tab Pro and Tab S.  The video was smooth and clear with a good amount of light.  In lower light the video is grainier but still smooth. Of course the network you are on will impact on how smooth the video will be.Fingerprint readerThe fingerprint reader is new to the tablet line. The Tab Pro 8.4 does not have a finger print reader, I realize how much I would like the fingerprint reader.  I thought using a pattern was excellent for not having to type in a password \/ pin.  Setup was easy, with 8 swipes of my finger my print was registered.  You also need to setup a password for that just in case scenario.  A major plus for me is that finger print reader integrates with Lastpass. If you are Lastpass Premium user you will appreciate being able to use your fingerprint for accessing websites.  You still need to use your master password.Battery.The battery in the Tab S is slightly bigger that the one in the Tab Pro.  With the switch to the AMOLED screen Samsung was able to gain ~2 hours of battery life. My estimation is you will get ~8 hours of gaming time and ~10 hours of video time.  With the Tab Pro I would get about ~8 hours of video time. If you set the brightness yourself and have it set too high the battery life will decreaseThe auto-brightness is annoying at times because it dims for no reason.During the idle state the battery barely even moves.  The Tab S battery lost 1% after sitting in an idle state for 7 hours overnight. This will vary greatly based on how many applications were loaded into memory prior to the tablet going into the idle state.  I loaded multiple applications be putting it into the idle state after 5 hours it lost 8%.Other features SideSync \/ IR BlasterIf you already a Samsung Phone S4 \/ S5 etc then you can setup the Sidesync between the Tab S and your phone.  It is a nice feature if you want leave your phone in another room and answer calls on the tablet. It is little odd seeing a simulation of your phone on the tablet but the feature does work.  Not sure how much I will use it.I do use the IR for change channels on the set top box.  I can quickly go through the guide on the tablet and send the signal to change the channel.  It always nice to have the extra remote when other remote decides to go missing.Samsung ExtrasMost of the extras are worthless because they are no more than a 3 month trial of the premium services that are offered by the companies. For example, you get 1TB bitcasa for 3 months after that you are on the hook for $10 a month. Some require you to give your credit card to activate the trialWhen you install the Samsung Kindle app (not the regular kindle app) you get to choose a free book every month. The book selection is small (4 for June). The regular price of the books is 3 to 4 dollarsYou get an addition 48GB of storage space from Dropbox once you have completed a few steps. The extra storage is for two years so have to be aware on how much space you are using. You have the option to automatically back up your photos to drop box.Enterprise ready.I have already been using my Tab Pro to read email and do calendaring.  The tablet also comes with the option to install Samsung Knox so you have sandbox area for work related activities separate from your personal area.If the rumor is true about Microsoft bring MS Office to the Android tablet then the Tab S will be perfect with high resolution.Final thoughtsSamsung has a clear winner with the Tabs S.  I absolutely recommend this tablet anyore who waiting for a high end Android Tablet with expandable memory. The screen is worth premium priceWho this tablet may not be for.- If you are heavily invested in the Apple ecosystem.- Diehard Samsung Note users.  If you are in love with the S pen and the capabilities it brings then you may want to wait to see what Samsung has up it sleeves for the future of the Note line- Casual Internet surfer and video watcher. No need to spend the extra money when a lower price, lower end model will fill your needs.- Always connected user.  The LTE model will be out shortly after the release of the wifi models so wait little longer. The price will be higher and there is the data cost but that is exactly what you are looking for- Users who want the 32GB model.- Users who dislike bloatware. I would like to see Samsung bring out a Google Play edition of the Tab S.  I do not see that happening anytime soon.If you have any questions please ask in the comments I will try to answer them to the best of my ability.My tablet experienceThis has nothing to do directly with the Tab S other than my tablet history, so you can ignore this part if you have no interest but it may help if you have questions for comparison with what I own.My first tablet was the 1st generation iPad.  I have to give Apple credit for the innovation and to help drive industry to where it is today. I still own the iPad but it collects dust now. That is my only IOS product. (My wife did have the 1st gen iPhone) My first Android was an Acer A500, which I still own and use. I bought a Lenovo K1 for my daughter but it did not last. (I will never buy another Lenovo Tablet) Had a Samsung S2 phone which is now my oldest daughter's phone. My wife and I both have Galaxy S4 phones.  We bought our daughters Kindle Fire 8.9 HD tablets (Kindles are great for kids) I really wanted a higher end tablet but passed on the Nexus 7 2013 because I wanted the option to expand the memory and a bigger screen.  When the Tab Pro 8.4 was released I knew the Tab Pro was the tablet I was waiting for.  As I mentioned earlier it is a bit disappointing that Samsung has basically replaced the Tab Pro 8.4 model the Tab S after a few months. I will get plenty of usage out both the Tab Pro 8.4 and Tab S 8.4","rating":4},{"comment":"Between my wife and I there was a need for a secondary portable device as our iPad Air is used constantly between us. It's always charging in between uses, and we're usually fighting over it in the evening. I knew I wanted a smaller device, but concluded that the Nexus 7 is just too small for games and movies. I considered the iPad Mini but wasn't excited by yet another iOS device (we also have iPhones). Historically I've used the first Galaxy Tab, the HP Touchpad with WebOS and Android, the iPad 3 and the iPad Air.After spending a few days with the new Samsung Galaxy Tab S, i'm not really convinced Samsung has what it takes here to truly recommend over iPad offerings. But with that out of the way, it's a pretty compelling tablet in it's own right. Lets get some of the negatives out of the way:- It lacks tablet specific apps you can get on the iPad (this biggest negative I can really give here. This is really the decisive factor. If I didn't already have an iPad, this would have been a non-starter.- The need for Samsung to implement their own hardware buttons that are too easy to accidentally hit is annoying.- The need for Samsung to implement touchwiz, proprietary software bloat and other questionable features (fingerprint unlock is pretty bad)- Despite two Quad-Core Enyxos processors working off each other, the tablet isn't as snappy as the iPad Air. Animations often stutter, and slight hiccups in entering and exiting programs can be a little jarring for iOS users.Positives:+ The colorful and beautiful Super AMOLED display make this the premiere tablet for Android gaming, and on the go video watching. It's noticeable more crisp and colorful than the iPad Air and iPad Mini with Retina. Has Excellent viewing angles+ It's super light, super thin which makes it a luxury when traveling.+ It includes stereo speakers on each side of the tablet that are noticeably louder and more clear than the iPad Air, just try to avoid covering them with your hands.+ The freedom to fully change browsers, keyboards, run old emulators like Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, run different home screen apps which change the interface.+ Battery life is pretty excellent. Historically Android devices have a weird battery drain on standby, and will chew up battery with heavy use. This device sips battery which is impressive for an OS that's as open and complex as Android.+ The thought of knowing that Android L which looks beautiful is just around the corner for this device.--The simple conclusion is this: If you're an Android fan, you're probably looking at a Nexus 8 coming around the corner. If you're an Amazon user you're probably looking at a kindle. If you're neither of those things and want a premium tablet, you could do much worse than the Samsung Galaxy Tab S. In every way this is a premium tablet. However, iPad is still after all these years is more polished, with an edge in tablet app support. Keep that in mind when spending the asking price, which is the same price as the Apple equivalent tabs.","rating":4},{"comment":"I was really excited about getting this for my daughter.  She needed a smaller device than the typical iPad and this looked like a very nice tablet.  I also paired it with a nice, high speed 64gb memory card and expected to have a premium setup.I guess the real selling point of this tab is the Super Amoled screen, and it is awesome.  If you are getting the tablet as a movie watching device, then it is impressive. But I can't help but wonder, if you are using it to watch movies - why not get a 10.1 or wait for a 12.2 Tab S to come out?Oddly, I did not experience the battery life that some other reviewers reported.  I can WATCH the battery drain when I am using this tablet.  My kids like to use it for video recording and it just chews up battery when recording and playing back video - it gets very warm as well. I disabled bluetooth and anything not necessary to try and improve life and it just eats up the batteries.Overall, this is a very sharp looking device with an amazing screen. It has nice specs on paper, especially with the latest processors and 3G of RAM - but it never blew me away as being particularly snappy.Currently I own a Tab Note 10.1, the Tab S 8.4, a Note 3 Phone, and several iPads, including the latest iPad Air.90% of the time I carry my iPad Air.  I am writing this on a PC with Windows 8.1, I have never owned a Mac and don't like them. I am not an Apple fan boy.  But when it comes to tablets, Apple still leads the way right now.  I'll take a new iPad over any tablet I have right now.  I'd LOVE to see that change because Apple infuriates me with stupid things like not allowing us external memory storage.  And the reason I have a Note 3 is that Apple kept making tiny iPhones and I bailed on mine (I had a 3, 3Gs, and 4)  looking for a larger screen.  I may go back if\/when they release the iPhone 6 if the screen is big enough.  But to be honest, I'd prefer a phone the size of the Tab S!  So that may or may not happen. I include all of this to let you know that I do have a VARIETY of tablets, phones and devices, and I am not particularly an Apple loyalist.But I feel like Apple still leads the way in this category.","rating":3},{"comment":"Samsung has done it again AND again. They are releasing tablets at very periodic intervals. I have been using Galaxy Tab 2 and 3, and TabPro series and I am very much impressed with Galaxy line of devices. First, if you have not had any tablets before and can afford the 8\"+ TabPro or S series, Get THEM!  It is ideal for reading books and emails. I use 8\" Tablet to read epub books (Aldiko) and it was a very pleasant experience. I got both 8.4\" and 10.5\" S series and love them. Feature wise, they are very similar. I am a big Android tablet fan and you will not be disappointed with these.! Samsung has iterated a lot to reach here.Samsung has introduced 8.4\" S and 10.5\" S now. This year the space has become crowded as Samsung also has 8.4\", 10.1\" and 12.2\" Tab Pro Series.  Resolutions are great and I would get either S or TabPro versions.Let's start off with salient points of all of the Galaxy Tab S series. I have also listed brief specs of current leading tablets at the very end if you would like to really compare and shop. If you have Tab Pro, don't upgrade. No need to. Those devices worked well few months back and still are. The photos look just as beautiful on them as they did a few months ago!Look at three specs that really interest you and nail down the tablet you need.

Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 128 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. This tablet has both bluetooth 4.0\" and have USB Host capability. USB Host is one of the most under noticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.Finally, believe me; don't get mired in the spec game.

Remember the laptop wars, 10\", 12\" 13\", 15, 17 and even some 19\" if I remember right few years ago. We used to debate endlessly which laptop sizes are better, which has better speakers and so on. The time has come to fight it out for tablets!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera\/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you.

It is thin, light, has a gorgeous screen, and just the right size.  A little background about myself,  I use an Android Phone(Motorola Droid Maxx HD), a Windows phone for work(Nokia Lumia 920), an Apple iPad 2, and my wife has an iphone 5S.  So I consider myself a very diverse geek among the major mobile OS.There are plenty of technical reviews out there so I am only going to talk about my experience.  I was getting frustrated with my iPad 2 and bought a Samsung Tab Pro 8.4 right before the Tab S was announced.  The Tab Pro is a great tablet but the one I received has a battery issue where it will not charge to 100%.  I returned it back to Amazon and tried to buy the new Tab S but it was not in stock.  So I went to my local Best Buy and bought a titanium bronze Tab S 8.4 16GB the day after it was available.At first I thought the Tab Pro is really thin and light, the Tab S is even lighter and thinner.  It is so much easier to hold the tablet in bed watching Hulu Plus than the iPad 2 which weights over twice as much as the Tab S.  I also dislike the cold and slippery aluminum back of the iPad 2.  The plastic back on the Tab S is gripper and more comfortable to hold. The wide screen format makes sense and I don't miss the supposedly larger screen on the iPad 2.Everything you read about the screen is true, it is a gorgeous display.  Being AMOLED must have help extend the battery life too.I added a 64 GB SD card and loaded with photos, music, and videos.  The tablet supports ANT+, it should communicate wirelessly with my Garmin 800 cycling computer.  I haven't try it yet.There is one thing I don't like about the Tab S is the goldish trim. Some people might like it but it is a minor thing and I can live with that.So the bottom line is that if you want a thin, light tablet with incredible screen and battery life.  You have find the right tablet here.","rating":5},{"comment":"The last tablet that I purchased was a 2013 Nexus 7. When I bought this I had planned on buying an iPad mini. I've owned a 3rd gen iPad, it was a great device though it was too large for my taste. I've also owned the first nexus 7 and the first galaxy tab 10.1. To start off with, this tablets screen is not even comparable to any other tablet I have previously owned. It blows both the iPad mini's and Air's screen out of the water. The colors are amazing, bright, and not too &#34;poppy&#34; for my eyes. I put this next to my brothers iPad and his IPS LCD looks outdated.Having owned several nexus products, I have become accustomed to the &#34;vanilla&#34; android experience. I briefly owned a Galaxy S3 and absolutely hated the touchwiz interface which I felt to be far too clunky and complicated, compared to the ease of vanilla android. This tablet gets it just right in terms of what is included with touchwiz. It's obvious that they have dialed it back significantly.Watching YouTube, Netflix, etc...is a wonderful experience. Again, I placed an iPad mini next to this and the difference is very apparent. The AMOLED screen can turn off each individual pixel so the blacks are totally black. The iPads LCD by comparison remains backlit across the board and the darks are much brighter.Reading magazines on the kindle app is also a joy.My only beef with this tablet: When switching between apps, going to the home screen, or doing something else that requires a full screen refresh the tablet stutters. Often times when going to the home screen whatever widget I have running will disappear as the screen refreshes and then reappear. This is absolutely unacceptable in an eight core tablet with 3gb of ram. It shows that the software was not properly optimized before Samsung pushed it out the door. It has already received two updates, but the stutter problem remains. I am hopeful that Android 5.0 (which I am already running on the nexus 5 I am typing this review on) fixes these problems. Android 5.0 will require everything to run in Android run time or ART and dalvik will fall to the wayside (I believe).Other than that gripe this is a fantastic tablet. My only wish now is that third party case makers will jump on the bandwagon and get some rugged cases for this tablet out on the market.","rating":4},{"comment":"If you're thinking about picking one of these up, it might be a better idea to wait for the Galaxy Tab Pro S Elite Humpty Dumpty Extreme Edition. At the rate Samsung is putting out these tablets, that one will probably be out around October :PSigned,A disgruntled Galaxy Tab Pro owner.","rating":1},{"comment":"Now this is what a tablet should be. Unbelievable screen clarity, Very, very fast. Sidesnyc allows me to connect directly to my Galaxy Note 3 and even make phone calls from the tablet. I can see and use everything on my phone from the tablet. And did I say how incredibly fast it is? Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. You will not be disappointed if you buy this machine..","rating":5},{"comment":"Everyone knows all the pro's, so let's look at what they messed up:Not much.  Just the same pesky stuff they've been messing up for years (read engineers isolated in a vacuum lol).An inherent design issue with these slab-tabs is grip.  Samsung chose to ship this without a cover, and they make it extremely hard to get one in the first 30 days.  They also did this on all of their high end phones such as the Note series.  Without a cover, it's a slip\/drop accident in the making.  Yes, you'll drop it, and yes you'll have finger prints all over the screen trying to hold on.IMHO the 3rd party warranties that are being pushed are another accident in the making.  Never hear too many good outcomes about these guys, and plan to be without your Tab for a while.  I noticed in the reviews that most owners just get their old one back in the same condition, but now officially certified broken.Remember this thing has no cellular radios.  Not that I really want one.  If I need wifi while on the road etc, I just mobile hotspot my cell (free with ATT nowadays @ 20GB it's about time).  They also ignored texting with this device, but there's a few downloads I'm going to try.A lot of apps are not ready for this amount of hi-res screen real estate.  But they're getting there.  Some just look sloppy, and a few will core\/quit.The multi-window thing is not much more than work in progress.  It only works with a few apps, and then it seems silly.  I'd rather the tab itself speed up foreground application switching, through cache etc. than a failed attempt at true windowing.Buttons.  Menu isn't menu.  The home is now on the side when you use it up\/down.  And without a case or a grip, you'll always be hitting some button that will take you into some other part of the world.  Get used to using your left hand for back, home, and get used to using your fingernails to hang on.The fingerprint reader is not all that hot.  It doesn't work half the time, and will time you out for a full 30 secs after 3-4 failed tries.  I just turned it off.  That was one feature I really thought I'd like and could use, but in practice it's just not that useful.  A old-timey screen swipe is still king of the unlocks.Performance is ok, but it won't knock you off your chair.  But ok is good enough in this case.  Not sure if the 8 core processors that are being used for the non-US units perform any better, but I would imagine they would.  Main issue you'll experience is a small lag from one screen or app to another.  Sometimes it can be a second or so.  Not much really, but do it 30x and you'll find yourself waiting a surprising amount of time overall.Samsung\/Google STILL does not have resizable icons - even on Android 4.x.  The icons are circa-2008 and are huge.  The screen is so hi-res, you could shrink your icons down to 25% of their concreted-size and still be very visible and useful.  So if you want to really customize your UI, you'll have to go with another launcher.  I use Go-Launcher (have for years).  Now I've got 10 icons across, and about 15 rows down.  With text.  And the hot-icons at the bottom are also customizable.In fact while I'm at it, this whole stupid touchwiz thing has just got to go.  It's a static, pre-configured UI and not even worthy of a tab of this caliber.  Look guys, put your development efforts into making Android a full blown OS rather than re-arranging the icons every release for each device then calling it &#34;the new TouchWiz&#34;.  Team up with one of the launcher guys and make it useful.  Windows and IOS are kicking your butt here.Some of the *free* software like Dropbox is surprisingly useful.  But to get dropbox to work, you'll have to refer 5 friends, install it on 2 other computers and the like.  More fine print.  And read it carefully if you're making your purchasing decision based on free s\/w as they all have some little kink like that.Now charging and batteries.  First you MUST use the included charger and cable.  It will not charge with a 3rd party micro USB cable, or a longer one.  It will not charge with another USB port.  It will charge while connected to my iMac, but not a Thinkpad.  And it still takes forever to charge - like 4-5 hours at the shortest.  Now in all fairness since it's new I'm banging it pretty hard, and killing the battery in about 5-6 hours of use time.  The sleep mode keeps all the wifi\/BT stuff alive, not sure how to put them to sleep also but maybe you can.  Not sure it matters as that huge screen is the highest power drainer.And no, you can't swap out the batteries like you can on the Notes or S3-4-5.  And you've never been able to swap batteries on any Apple IOS product.  Heck, iPad\/iPhone still don't have a memory card slot after 10 years of incessant screaming from their customers.  Actually since Steve died they haven't had much of anything new have they - but that's another story.Ok, if you've read this far you know all the annoying stuff that's still not fixed or well conceived.  Believe me - none of this annoying stuff is a show stopper for this unit.Why?  Because the ONE thing that we use the most, and the one thing we've tossed the most rocks at Samsung about - the screen - is by far the best display of about any device out there.  And it's better than almost all computers sans the new 4k displays.  From our incessant screaming for years for 1) replaceable battery 2) stereo speakers 3) memory card slot 4) a super-hi res screen 5) fingerprint login and 6) a thin bezel, out of the 6 they fixed 3 or 4 pretty well.  Not bad.  LG, Sony and Apple take note and turn up your hearing aid.  (Oh - yes there are two speakers on this thing left and right that somehow did not make the specs list).Samsung always waits to see sales figures before they make cases and keyboards.  So you'll wait as nobody else has them either.So for the $$, I felt I really got what I paid for.  I reassure myself every time I turn it on and it jumps out at me.  And everyone around me hangs over my shoulders to see.  Yea, it's that good","rating":4},{"comment":"This is my fourth Samsung 10 inch tablet Ive tried in the last couple of years. Ive always wanted to replace my iPad with an android tablet especially one made by Samsung. Almost all my electronics that I own are made by Samsung, except for my iPad Air and Apple TV 2. This tablet is an improvement over the Tab pro which was released just 6 short months ago. I kind of wish Samsung had just waited longer and released this tablet instead of the tab pro.Whats new and improved:The tab s feels much better built over previous Samsung tablets Ive tried. The previous tablets had a much more plastic feel to them and make clicky sounds when holding them. This one feels nice in the hand with the nice grippy material and also looks more higher end.Touch wiz is more simplified and faster.This tablet has 3gb of ram, which is 1gb more than the tab pro.  Its much faster now and multitasking is smoother. More apps can run in the background and fewer refreshes in apps and on webpages.Improved screen quality since the screen is now an AMOLED, its brighter and has better battery life. The screen is also larger now at 10.5\" when compared to the tab pro which was 10.1\".This tablet has a built in finger print scanner. This is a very handy feature to have for added security without having to type in a PIN, password or pattern. Too bad this feature hardly works. I had to slide my finger a good two to three times for it to register and unlock the screen for me. No other tablet on the market has this feature currently including the iPad Air. I am glad samsung added this feature but it needs work.Ultra power saving mode can greatly increase battery life especially when it's very low. Although it turns the screen into black and white and only allows you to use a few selected apps. I really don't see how this is that handy on a tablet, but, is super handy to have on your smartphone like it is on the s5. Still nice for samsung to include this.Side Sync is an built app that allows you to access your Samung Galaxy Smartphone remotely while on the same wifi network. You can take calls, read\/reply to texts and transfer files from you tablet. This is very handy feature. I thought initially it only worked on the newer S5 but I was able to download the app on my S4. Sadly I couldnt get the feature to work with my s4.The tab s also has a new private mode which allows you to hide files, pictures and videos. The private mode is also incorporated with finger print scanner so that the hidden files only show when using your finger to unlock the screen.What still needs improvement:The placement of the menu and back capacitive buttons still comes in the way and gets accidentally pressed when using the tablet in portrait mode. I guess you could just use the tablet in landscape mode all the time.The tablet ecosystem in the google play for 10\" tablets is very limited. There are still many apps that just dont take advantage of this tablets larger, higher resolution screen or aspect ratio. This is not the case with iPads and one of the main reasons why I still prefer my iPad Air. Some of the apps cant even run in landscape mode which is what this tablet is meant to be used in. Here is just a small list of the tablet apps that are not optimized yet: Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Yelp, Dropbox, Dictionary, Instagram, Epocrates, Medscape, WebMD, Zedge, Tapatalk.I still found there to be some lag from time to time. At times the tablet was just really fast and other times it was lagging for no apparent reason. I installed nova launcher and disabled many samsung and google unneeded apps to make it slightly better.I also found there to be issues with the network connection. The tablet always seemed to be connected to my router but from time to time I experienced issues with it loading pages or refreshing apps. I had no issues like this on any other device on my network. So I suspect it was the tablet only that this issue.The screens responsiveness was not up to par with other touch screen devices I own and tried. At times I would have to press the screen muilitiple times before it would respond.The watch on tv remote seemed to give me very odd and weird information. It would show me content that had nothing to do with my cable provider or the channels I selected. I took a look at the same app on my Samsung S4 and the information was totally different. The information on th s4 app was correct. Maybe a future update to the wach on app on the tab s will improve the results for me.Although battery life is much improved in this tablet. Its still not as good as what Im getting with my iPad Air. With the tab s I was getting about 8-10 hours of screen time mostly from surfing web pages and a little youtube streaming. With the brightness at about 30% and some notifications enabled. With my iPad Air I can easily get 15 hours with the same type of usage and settings. If I really push its limits I can get about 18 hours of screen time on my iPad Air.Samsung Tab S vs iPad AirThe tab s clearly has better hardware and specs. The screen is so much better than the iPad Air. The tab s has higher resolution screen and more pixels per inch than the iPad Air.  The iPad Air's 9.7\" screen is smaller than the tab s which is 10.5\". The screen also get much brighter is great for outdoor use. The screen also gets much dimmer which is better for night reading.The placement of the speakers on the tab s is much better. When watching a video you get the nice stereo effect in landscape mode. With the iPad Air the speaker are not placed on either side of the screen, so you only get the stereo effect when using the tablet in portrait mode. I did find the speakers on the iPad Air to have more bass in them. Both tablets had just as loud speakers in my opinion.The Tab s had micro sd slot so expanding storage is cheap and easy. It accepts cards up to 128gb. But the use of card is limited quite a bit now since the kitkat update. Not at appps can run and be stored on the sd card. Also apps iSyncr for example which is an app that allows you to transfer your music wirelessly from your PC to your tablet\/phone, only works when connecting your devcie via usb to your pc. Or you have to root your device to gain full rights over your own sd card.The tab s has only about 10gb of available storage out of the box. There is no 32b version available right now and also no choice of getting more storage. With an iPad you can get up to 128gb storage, but storage is expensive at $100 each step up.The tab s has included gps. In order to get gps with an Ipad you have buy an LTE enabled model which is another $120.The tab s can run two apps side by side at the same time. Not all apps are support with this feature, but its very handy when multitasking. The IPad Air cant do this.The tab s has the watch on tv app and a built in IR blaster. Makes it easy to control your home entertainment system from your tablet. The iPAd AIr doesnt have this feature.Overall the tab s is nice improvement over the last version. My main reason in sticking with my Ipad Air is the app support. I also prefer the 4:3 ratio that the Ipad AIr has. It looks great in portrait mode for reading and browsing web pages. I dont like the tab s in portrait mode it just isnt functional that way. If you use your tablet mostly for watching videos and playing games, I would say the tab s is the better choice. Also if you use your tablet alot outdoors than the tab s is better since it gets brighter. But the Ipad does have better battery life, better support,higher resale value, Airplay, Multitasking Gestures and more accessories. Also the Ipad Air will updates much quicker. I have no idea how long the Tab s will take to get android L. Probably atleast a good 3-6 months once its publicly released. Where as the Ipad AIr will get iOS 8 the day it comes out. My only main gripe about my Ipad Air right now is the lack of ram, at 1gb it has to refresh apps and website frequently. The tab s is better for multitasking. You cant go wrong either way. They both are great tablets. But the tab s is more versatile and has better value.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is the best Android tablet I've ever owned. Thanks to beautiful AMOLED display, there's no horrific light bleed that I had with the Note 2014. Color is over-saturated but this can be evaded by changing display mode. However, out of the box performance was horrible. It came with tons of preinstalled bloatware which caused a major lag and waste of storage. For example, I don't use Netflix but it won't allow me to uninstall it without root. Fortunately, there's an option that allows me to disable most of the preinstalled apps and got rid of the lag issue. Well, lag and stutterness aren't completely gone but they were sure reduced by 99%. Although this won't free up more space, but if you want smooth, stutter-less experience, be sure disable the preinstall apps.","rating":5},{"comment":"I did a research for 2 months about tablets since I don't like to buy things by impulse... Since is a medium\/large investment I wanted to be sure that this is what I need it... Currently I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 as a phone and a Macbook as a laptop.. Previously I had an Iphone 4s and an Ipad Retina Display which undoubtedly you can guess I was an apple user... But when I bought the Galaxy S4 I did it because I needed a flexible device with more space and I can't afford paying extra $100 for 16gb more on i-devices when you have android devices with memory card Slots which you can purchase 64gb for $30... Same happened with the tablet... I wanted a device that can replace what I normally do on the computer:- facebook- youtube- email- browsing- downloading torrent- watching movies (all formats mkv, avi, mp4, etc)- watching or editing word docs- listen to music- playing casual games...On the Galaxy Tab S I'm doing all that with plenty space or power to do more things... let me give you my review of the main point of this tablet:Display: nothing more to add that hasn't been said... simply the best display on a tablet.... its look much better than my Ipad retina display (which I gift it to my GF), color on ipad look pale and wash out... people complaint that color on super amoled look over saturated... and even if they do... I don't get how people complaint about it when it just look better than any other devices..Design: This is something that I don't care that much... since I'm not looking all the time at the back of the device... I'm looking at the screen... but feel like a premium device... is super thin... and lightweight.. Yep.. the Ipad look more premium with the metal cases.. but the Galaxy tab S doesn't feel cheap like other samsung tablets like the galaxy tab 3...Power: The octa core processor work great.. I'm giving this device a very heavy use so far and I haven't felt any major hiccup or lag... yes sometimes It doesn't response right away like when you exit out of an app and want to open other app right away... but is just normal like any other premium android device... unfortunately this is how the OS works... don't get me wrong... is really fast and these so called hiccups or lag are barely noticeable and even if you noticed, its for about 2 secs then the tablet response is normally... It happened sometimes on my retina display Ipad as well... I guess this is normal for any device with... well.. ram... even computers have the same problem for over years...Interface \/ OS: This has been the main problem with androids.. the ecosystem is not a fancy and good looking as the IOS and samsung touchwiz is not well optimized and look dull... I have to say that by far this is the best touchwiz experience that I had.. I still prefer how IOS look and feel over android, but this is a major improvement comparing it with my Jelly Bean Galaxy S4... kitkat touchwiz is on the right direction... but they are not quite there yet... the black and blue tones are something borring and the menu, settings, contacts, profile, etc.. haven't change since... well.. ever.... just minor touches but still look the same... I'm hoping for a major overhaul with android L... I hope that they change the interface on touchwiz... that since galaxy S1 is very similar to latest version... The magazine interface is good, but is laking of widget and customization.. I'm hoping on future versions that they allow us to select free feeds to add to the widgets since they only have a couple &#34;categories&#34; that I don't care that much like culture, bussiness, living, photos, travel.. etc... I don't see gaming or movies like on flipboard... and they only have twitter as a feed, I don't see facebook or instagram...Apps: IOS has more tablet dedicated apps, but is not noticeable for my usage, email, youtube and browser are tablet friendly and that is what I use the most... facebook and all other work fine... even if they are phone versions... look and feel better than on my galaxy S4... android had the same problem with apps vs the app store a few years back and they catch up... they will do the same shortly with tablets.... Some apps doesn't work on my country like paper garden, milk music and most of the &#34;gift apps&#34; that come with the table... but is not a big deal for me...Camera: haven't use it... I don't care about it..FingerPrint scanner: This is a feature that I don't care that much but it Work 95% of the time... is a good ratio if you asked me... I heard some bad reviews that It never works... but is working fine for me...Multi-Users: this is great... you can have 2 users on the same tablet like on computers... I'm not sure if there is a feature like this on IOS but is perfect for me, since I can have 2 accounts... one for me and one for my GF....Multi tasking\/ multi windows: Work perfect... this is another thing that IOS is missing... I was considering buying an Ipad Air over this... but even on IOS 8 there is no multi tasking... I use this a lot since I translate some documents... I had the translator app on top and the word app at the bottom and do my work directly from my galaxy tab S without even open my computer...Battery: I head so many great things... but I had to say that battery is average.... I will say same or even a little less than the Ipad... don't get me wrong.. it last the whole day with normal usage... but it drain out the battery fast when I use my torrent app... or when I download anything...Usage: perfect laptop replacement... I download some movies on it.. and watch them on any format... I have some movies and videos on my computer and I don't have to use the stupid itunes and a program to convert my avi movies to mp4 in order to transfer the movies to the tablet... I just simply copy them to my SD card.. and that's it... since I have Tab S I haven't use my computer only to do this review since involve a lot of typing... I'm just waiting for that keyboard case for this tablet and I'll be done.Bottom line, is an excellent device if you plan to replace your laptop or use it less since is more confortable to do it from a tablet... I'm using my phone even less... since I prefer to browse facebook and twitter on the tablet than on the phone... the screen is amazing... better than any laptop\/tablet I've ever seen... and the multi tasking and sd card slot are the catch that put me away from other IOS device... more tablet dedicated apps are coming daily on the play store... so is not a deal breaker over the ipad... and the ecosystem is getting in the right direction.. even touchwiz is looking better these days than previous versions....","rating":5},{"comment":"Bought this tablet and upgraded from a Tab Pro 8.4.1. The tablet is so thin and light.2. Screen is best ever on a tablet. The resolution and Super Amoled display is just terrific. Magazines and movies are a treat to watch.3. Fast. With 3gb of RAM,  this thing flies.This tablet is the best android tablet ever created. Samsung gets it right with Multiwindpw and other customizations that make this Tab S really great. The size is perfect and with an optional keyboard case, this thing can be a laptop replacement. What a terrific tablet.","rating":5},{"comment":"This tablet with the actual Samsung OEM cover is fantastic.  Whatever praise has been heaped on the screen isn't nearly enough.  Bright, sharp, contrast, blacks, and whatever else can be said to be good about it certainly is.I love it all around so far and agree with all the positive comments.The very few niggles I have already have been expressed by others.  Namely, there can be an occasional lag.  I don't know why.  In addition, the screen can be a little overly distracting because of all the non-icon stuff on there.  I prefer a screen with icons.  That's it.  It's a personal thing, but it seems to me that a reduction in clutter would be a welcome thing by anyone.","rating":5},{"comment":"I ordered this from Samsung. I had a galaxy tab pro that I loved but the battery just couldn't hold a charge so I figured I try this and this is a awesome just awesome tablet but the battery life is a bit weak compared to my tab pro but other than that Samsung blew it out of the park but think about it before you buy it your walking straight into Touchwiz I rooted mine and installed Cyanogen it works so much better just a note and everything on this tablet is just wow I would buy it but if you don't plan on rooting it prepare for slow downs in the OS","rating":4},{"comment":"What can I say, best Tablet on the market, hands down. Beats Apple and cheaper. Amolded screen, 2560x1600 WQXGA, twice the resolution of HDTV. Which is absolutely beautiful and crystal clear. Best videos ever. Blacks are really true black. 16 GB memory and 3 GP of Ram. You can use two different apps, side by side same time, flawlessly and it doesn't slow you down. Very lightweight, sleek and stylish. Memory is expandable to 128 GB. I put in a 32 GB micro SD card, and it works perfect. Their are things on here I have not even used but available such as the fingerprint scanner. This tablet is simply very quick and the answer to your tablet immediate answers. The 10 inch screen, is perfect size, for any application or email. Simply put if you want a tablet that does it better, quicker and faster, you want this tablet. I have only owned it for a few weeks, my only regret, wish I had bought it sooner. Highly recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"For that and this is my toy that lets me do what I want.  I or my wife own I pads and Kindle HD and a galaxy tab pro and nothing beats the pleasure of watching movies on this (for a tablet-not that 60 inch curved tv at Magnolia). There is detail and depth and color. I use any content apps I want- Hulu, Netflix, Xfinity, it looks fantastic.  Amazon prime music app now let's you listen and download for offline listening if you have prime. I don't believe that prime video is supported on this device or any Android tablet. Not through a nonexistent app or the Chrome browser.The micro SD slot is important to me if I'm looking at photos I take with a separate camera and don't wish to use a computer to put them onto the cloud just to see them or jump through other hoops  or hurdles to look at my content.Speaking of pictures I worried that this display would over saturate the ones I took and give me a false representation or candy colors. I like to see how I'm doing on a larger screen and take a tablet along with me frequently and Samsung uses an adaptive display for your various content that tones things down depending on what your doing.  My photos look pretty  natural, but  very detailed.  I love this thing for a lot of reasons. There are plenty of things to customize and make your own. It will have been a good purchase.","rating":5},{"comment":"Let's review the specs.  For $500 you get a 10.5 inch screen, ultra thin body with high resolution screen, a stated 9 hour battery runtime, around 10 ounces in weight and 3GB RAM.The new iPad?  Nope, it's the new entry from Samsung, the Galaxy Tab S 10.5.But let's be realistic -- it's designed to compete with the iPad in an attempt to topple the latter from its throne so comparisons must be made in that respect.As compared to the iPad Air, this unit has a slightly larger screen and maybe weighs a bit more, but otherwise they are nearly identical in these areas.  Both also sport robust construction although a few I know that compared this to the iPad state the Apple version has the sleek aluminum structure; however, there is no faulting the Samsung.Unfortunately, both do share a similar trait -- forgo a case and you also forgo grip.  Both are so light and thin they are literally a drop accident waiting to happen.And while both tip the financial scales at identical pricing, the Samsung has a few upgrades.  First, you get 3GB RAM instead of the usual 1 for the iPad, then you'll notice the rear camera has a flash and an 8MP rating as opposed to the lower resolution iPad version (with no flash), and, finally, you get a micro-SD card slot (something Apple has been ignoring for years).However, it's the screen that will amaze.  AMOLED technology means colors are bright and blacks are, well, eerily black (almost new car, shiny black).  This is quite a contrast from the iPad's more sedate screen, although both are still amazing considering the technology from the earlier tablets, but the truth remains that side-by-side, the Samsung's screen really stands out.In fact, after a short while I had to tone down the brightness some as this unit will actually light up a room.  Nighttime discreet is not in the cards here.Performance-wise the Samsung gets the newer Android 4.4 OS which has a bevy of improvements over previous versions, too many to mention here.  Let it suffice to say that speed is not a problem here and I enjoy the interface over iOS versions which don't allow main screen widgets and much in the way of related animations.  In short, if you desire an OS that allows for streaming news and interactive widgets, this is the puppy for you.However, there are some quirks here.  Android allows for folders to be created on the screen to house multiple apps and this is done by either moving apps on top of each other (ala' Apple) which creates a new folder or by holding a finger on the screen to bring up a submenu to create a folder; however, Samsung tweaked this procedure and has made it so the only way to create desktop folders is by holding an icon until a menu appears on top of the screen and then scooting the icon to that area to create a folder.  Time consuming and somewhat unnecessary.Samsung added one perk to the mix, though -- a fingerprint scanner.  Swipe your fingerprint at the center bottom of the screen when prompted and it'll open the  OS as if you entered a password (word of caution -- remember the password in case your finger doesn't pass muster).  Although initially impressed, it some became apparent it had about a 40% success rate and is not for the impatient since it requires a slow, methodical swiping of the finger.Sound reproduction is an ongoing problem with any tablet unless you opt for the headphones but Samsung hit it here.  Sound reproduction is great.Performance, unfortunately, does come at a cost, though.  Although rated at 9 hours of battery life (down from an original estimate by some of closer to 11), those ignoring the battery saver functions built in will find themselves seeking an outlet at closer to 7, as in my case.  To be fair, I was running videos and jumping all over the internet so your mileage may vary.  For those that sometimes ignore the battery warnings, there is a power mode that turns the screen from color to B&W; and shuts down all but the essential apps.  Hopefully you don't have to use this mode much since you're getting down to the critical stage by that time but you can technically turn it on any time.On that power topic, I really couldn't find much that would cause this unit to lock up or slow down.  Even higher end, memory eating, games didn't seem to bother it much nor did forgetting to shut down the last 15 apps I opened while hammering away at another.  Guess that 3GB RAM does help a lot.So, are there any downsides here?  As with any tablet, including the vaunted iPad, there are faults:* Price is steep and encroaches on Apple territory.  Given the option of the Apple or Samsung at the same price, the vast majority chose the former.* Accessories?  What accessories? Few companies are producing cases and the like at this time and you can easily dump anywhere from $40 on up at Samsung's site to get cases which, oddly enough, seem to be lagging behind the release date of the tablet itself (although I may has misread that).  Because of the odd screen size (larger than the industry standard of 10.1\") you chance of making one of these fit into a generic tablet holder is about nil.* No 4G (or 3G for that matter) yet and capable models will not be out until later this year.  Oops, that's a biggie.* 16GB for main memory?  Really?  Yes, the Samsung does have a card slot that can accept up to 128GB, but not everything transfers to these cards (especially some apps) and transfer rates from these cards are still slower than the included drive.  Offer options here, folks.* Bloatware galore, and gimmicky stuff at that.  Fortunately, most of it just sits there and does nothing until you command differently; however, I was hoping those days were gone when tablets came out.  Problem is, some of that 16GB onboard is occupied with this stuff but I do have to commend Samsung for leaving what appears to be the majority on their website for download if desired.And, finally, there is the processor.  Instead of opting for the Intel Atom tablet series, Samsung opted to stay with the newest Enyxos quadcore version.  While wholly capable and probably just as appropriate as the Atom, the Intel name does carry cache over what was chosen.However, all things considered, Samsung could have a hit here, especially with those users not quite accustomed to Apple's version of \"take it or leave it\" iOS and lack of SD card support.  For the same price as a base Apple unit, Samsung buyers get more RAM, an SD card reader, the Android OS, and cameras with flash and better MP ratings.Update:  There have been a couple pesky little items that have cropped up that don't necessarily merit a drop in rating but should be kept in mind:*  The charger is just as bad as the old Apple iPad pre-Lightning version; however, it's even smaller and more fragile.  Mine is already starting to show signs of fatigue and there's no way of gingerly putting one in.  I can see this as an accident waiting to happen.*  Email notification is nothing short of lacking.  I have it on push yet this model is always behind my Apple  by at least a good couple minutes.  In addition, I'll delete an email only to have it suddenly reappear in my inbox.  Hmmm, something isn't right here.  Had to finally ignore the installed Samsung app and put in another.","rating":4},{"comment":"","rating":5},{"comment":"Android is a very capable operating system. With it, Google accomplished the unthinkable -- widespread Linux use by average home users. Linus Torvalds popularized his kernel with nerds and the enterprise, but the search giant made it accessible for all. Here's the thing though -- the fact that Android is powered by Linux doesn't matter. No, to the average consumer, all that matters is the experience. What lies beneath is inconsequential.Samsung recently released the Galaxy Tab S 10.5, its newest flagship tablet. The device's closest competitor is the iPad Air -- which is a tablet I love. Besides Apple's tablet, there is really no other product to consider at the $500 price point. So, if you are considering a $500 general-use tablet, the only question that must be asked is -- is it better than the iPad Air?Boy, what a tough question to answer -- tough, but not impossible. I've been using them both, side by side, for some time now and I have some definitive thoughts.Galaxy Tab S 10.5 SpecsNetwork -- Wi-Fi OnlyProcessor -- Exynos 5 Octa (1.9 GHz QuadCore &#65291; 1.3 GHz QuadCore)Display -- 10.5-inch WQXGA (2560x1600) Super AMOLED, 287ppiOS -- Android 4.4 (KitKat)Camera -- Rear: 8.0 Megapixel Auto Focus Camera with LED Flash, Front: 2.1 MegapixelConnectivity -- Dual-Band Wi-Fi 802.11 a\/b\/g\/n\/ac MIMO, BT v4.0, USB 2.0Memory 3GB RAM, 16GB Internal Memory, microSD (Up to 128GB)Battery -- Li-ion 7,900mAh (10.5)AnalysisThe first thing you notice upon taking the Tab S from the box is just how thin and light it is. Shockingly, at 6.6mm and 465 grams, it is even thinner and lighter than the iPad Air. This makes it very easy to hold and reduces arm-fatigue. Of course, at this point, we are splitting hairs -- both tablets are really thin and light.If you are in the market for a 10 inch tablet, the screen should be a huge factor in your decision. For a while, the iPad Air display was one of the best, if not the best. The retina display, while partly marketing-speak, produced beautiful and vivid images. While the display on Apple's tablet is still great, it can no longer be called the best.The Galaxy Tab S 10.5 offers a 2560 x 1600 resolution, but that is only part of the allure. The real news is the Super AMOLED technology, that recreates the most beautiful colors and imagery. Some may argue that this technology over-saturates the colors -- I must disagree. True, colors are more vivid, but not to the point of creating a mockery by any means. No, it instead treats the user to a more life-like experience.Where it really shines is in the sun (pun intended). In my backyard on a sunny day, the iPad Air is unusable. It is impossible to decipher what is on the screen, so I must head for shade. The display on the Galaxy Tab S, is a totally different story. Samsung's technologies allow the user to have a better experience under sunlight. This is achieved using sensors that adjust the display to your surroundings.Much like its smartphones, Samsung has implemented its TouchWiz improvements to the otherwise boring Android interface. When compared to the stock experience of something like a Nexus 10, TouchWiz makes the user experience much more colorful and lively. Things get taken to a new level with this tablet though, as it takes advantage of a tablet-optimized \"magazine\" mode, which I rather like. Don't like it? Install Nova Launcher. It's not a big deal, guys. Android gives you the option to choose.The iPad does not allow you to easily add additional memory. While you can jailbreak and access SD cards and flash drives, under normal usage that is not allowed outside of photo importing. Samsung's tablet offers a microSD slot, so you can add up to 128GB of additional storage on the cheap. While newer versions of Android are making it problematic for apps to use the card, it will work wonderfully for storing media, docs and any other file you want.The rear camera on the Galaxy Tab S 10.5 is actually not bad. Should it become your dedicated camera? No. Still, for a tablet, it is quite capable. There is very little noise and shutter is quick. However, the front-facing camera is pretty bad. Pictures come out very grainy, but it serves its purpose as a video-chat camera for services like Hangouts and Skype.Sound on the tablet is remarkable. While not front-facing like the class-leading Surface Pro 3, there are at least stereo speakers located on the sides, that lend to solid stereo separation. The user can actually make out right and left channels, something that can be lost when the speakers are positioned on the bottom or rear. Watching a movie on this tablet is a dream -- the combination of speakers and display make it the perfect Android-powered media tablet.Unfortunately, and strangely, the tablet uses USB 2.0 for connectivity. I understand that many people are moving towards the cloud and connecting to a PC is becoming a rarer occurrence. However, why implement USB 3.0 on the Galaxy S5 smartphone, but not on this flagship tablet? What is good for the goose, should be good for the gander, I say.The Tab S 10.5 uses a mixture of capacitive buttons and a hardware button on the long end of the rectangular bezel. Capacitive buttons are OK on a smartphone, but fail on a tablet. In other words, the hardware home button is fine -- the capacitive ones are the hindrance.When holding the Tab S vertically, my thumb is constantly hitting these touch-sensitive buttons. It ruins the experience when doing something like reading, as you want to be immersed in the story. Very often, when I relax and get comfortable, my thumb wanders to those buttons and ruins it all. Could this just be a learning curve? Sure, maybe I can train myself not to hit those buttons, but that should not be necessary. You can see what I am talking about in the above photo.For internet activity, it is a Wi-Fi only affair. This is fine, as I mostly use tablets in my home. If it does leave the house, I simply tether using my phone. The wireless chip in the Tab S is top-notch though, offering 802.11AC. When connecting to my Apple Airport Extreme, the 5GHz band was visible, it connected quickly and was super-fast. Nice!The iPad Air is a class-leader in battery life, but the Tab S is no slouch. While I did have to charge it more often than the iPad with equal usage, it still outperformed any other Android tablet I have used. On average, I would say it achieved about 10 hours of use between recharges, which for my usage, meant it would be charged about every three days. It would be in standby when not in use.My favorite aspect of the Samsung Galaxy S5 is the fingerprint reader. I am happy to say that it is equally accurate on the Tab S. However, I find it a bit awkward to use on a 10 inch tablet, when located on the middle of the bottom-horizontal bezel. I would prefer it to be located on the top right of the face, so I can easily slide my finger. This means the fingerprint reader and the button should be separated on tablets. Do I appreciate having it? Yes. Do I use it often? Yes. Is it ideally located? No.All in all, this tablet is incredible and should be bought although there are some things that holds it back from beating the iPadPlease rate if you found this helpful","rating":4},{"comment":"i'm an artist painter and photographer, and i write poetry and stuff... so, here goes:so far, so good -- the screen image is very tight, very nice and the size makes webpage reading easy. the camera is only so-so on low light, but i have cameras for low light and i'm not selfies-izing my life anyway. very quick, noticeably from my galaxy 4 7.only negative is that it's so large and i don't have a pocket for it and will have to carry a bag, i think. i'm looking today at the timbuk2 small classic messenger.I got this for an upcoming europe trip -- i should say that i don't and won't have a cell phone, so i'm strictly dependent on hot spots for connections when i'm not home. and, using this for reading a QR code at a bus stop in some town i might visit seems to me might be a little awkward; i guess i'm wondering how practical this really is. it's lighter and cheaper than a laptop, can do handwriting to font conversion in most text-input apps -- gmail for instance, and is big enough to watch movies on -- the resolution actually makes small-screen viewing sort of viable as movie --and, i suppose i'll get a bluetooth keyboard of some kind for writing essays and the stuff i do, when i'm travelling -- or, maybe even at home in bed... my expensive powerbook G4 mac broke at the electrical input so all i have is desktop pc these days... and, that would be a life-style changer: casual writing modes and how that would effect writing style. still, it's not like i'm going to be ( i hope ) burying my face in this machine every other moment, the way you see people doing now -- watching a screen while there's the most beautiful light out and the bus is driving past forests which look like they're out of disney.it's just the second day i've had this, though, and what do i know...? But, anyway, Amazon was great! I pre-ordered, and they said they'd send me an email when they could ship, and the next thing i know it's in my mailbox on the 27th -- just as i was wondering how long before they had it in stock. Amazon is always cool.","rating":4},{"comment":"The Good:+ Premium Design+ Magnificent Display+ Excellent Video Playback+ Very Good Music Experience+ Outstanding Performance+ Great for Games+ High Usability+ Plenty of AccessoriesThe Bad:- Some Controls (Sorting of App Tray) Are Hard to FindOverall:  The Samsung Galaxy Tab S is a premium Android tablet that is a video buffs dream come true.Background:  I have owned other Android tablets from Acer, ASUS, and Sony, but I wanted the Samsung Galaxy Tab S as a companion device to my Samsung Galaxy S5.Design:  The Tab S shares design elements with the S5.  While its body is plastic, it does not feel cheap or flimsy.  It is both thinner and lighter than my first Acer tablet, but that was a 7&#34; model.  Also like the S5, the Tab S has the dimpled back.  The controls are well laid out, and it feels familiar.  To me, it lives up to its paper and has the feel of a premium tablet.Setup:  Unlike other tablets, Samsung does not specify a specific amount of time for the first charge of the Tab S.  I simply put it on the charger and waited for the battery level to reach 100%.  It was at about 90% after a couple of hours when I went to bed - note it was at about 65% when I plugged it in.  I left it charging overnight, but I&#8217;m not sure how much longer it took to get to 100%.  There is a firmware update to install after initial setup, but I had no issues with it.  The tablet boots fairly quickly - 20 to 30 seconds.Display:  You may be wondering, &#8220;Does the 2560 x 1600 resolution make that much difference?&#8221;  In a word - yes!  Other than size, this is the biggest difference between the Tab S and the S5.  For a phone, the Galaxy S5 is no slouch by any means, but the Galaxy Tab S has eye-popping wow-factor.  I switched to the wallpaper to the one with the Ferris wheel, and it looks amazing.  Text is sharp and crisp, and web pages, Flipboard, email, and almost everything look great.Video:  So what&#8217;s the best way to take advantage of that magnificent display?  Moving watching is a sport.  And when it comes to movies, this is the tablet.  Netflix, YouTube, or your favorite app for watching your Ultraviolet collection are *the* way to showcase that screen.  You just might need to call in sick so that you can binge watch your favorite movies and shows.Music:  While the Galaxy Tab S is not a &#8220;boom box&#8221; or stereo, its speakers are more than serviceable for private listening.  Headphones improve sound if you&#8217;ve invested in a good set.  If you are looking at a premium tablet, you probably have premium headphones to go with it.  Amazon&#8217;s Prime Music is a great way to consume your music, but it is one of a multitude of options.  When you have the ability to add up to 128GB of storage through microSD cards, you can source your music just about any way that fits your budget.  The good news is that you are covered.Games:  The Galaxy Tab S also has great support for games.  It has plenty of processor and memory to handle intensive games like Riptide GP2, and once again, the display shows off - it really can&#8217;t help itself.  Are Plants vs. Zombies or Angry Birds more your speed?  These are here too with one exception.  There is an issue with Angry Birds Epic that seems to be unique to the Galaxy Tab S (and this is the only reason I still use my ASUS MeMO Pad FHD).  Other than that, it is game on!Usability:  As I mentioned in design, the controls of the Galaxy Tab S are well laid out and intuitive to use.  The user interface is almost identical to that of the Galaxy S5, and I know get why iPhone\/iPad people are so locked in.  This is the first time that I&#8217;ve had a phone and tablet that were so harmonious.  TouchWiz is a fine skin over stock Android.  It doesn&#8217;t make me do backflips, but I don&#8217;t hate it either.  Navigation and customization are smooth and straightforward.  The Galaxy Tab S is highly customizable, and it will delight power users looking to tweak everything to the nth degree.  The only thing I would have liked to be easier was switching the app sorting to alphabetical.  This was hard to find, and the default sorting drove me crazy.  That&#8217;s as close to a complaint as I can get.Accessories:  Samsung has distanced itself from the pack in the Android world, and there are benefits to going with the front-runner.  The first among them is the variety of accessories.  I bought a Samsung Book Cover designed for the tablet, but you have other options already.  Belkin I know has a case, but others will follow soon.  Accessory makers love the front-runner.  If you want a keyboard, Samsung makes a keyboard cover specifically for the Galaxy Tab S.  However, once again, there are other choices.  My generic Logitech keyboard for Honeycomb tablets works just fine, but even Logitech already has a keyboard case available.  I would even go so far as to say that the Galaxy S5 could be thought of as an accessory with the &#8220;SideSync&#8221; app.  It is a snap to mirror your Galaxy S5 on your Galaxy Tab S and have control over it.  If you are looking for other accessories, you should expect to find them for Samsung Tablets.Overall:  The Samsung Galaxy Tab S is a premium priced tablet that delivers a premium experience.  The classic question will be, &#8220;Is this an iPad killer?&#8221;  The think that is the wrong question.  My wife is an iPhone\/iPad user, and I played with both of these devices before upgrading my Android devices to the Samsung line.  While both the iPad and Galaxy Tab S are both premium tablets, they delight users in different ways.  The iPad is for people looking for an easy &#8220;it just works&#8221; experience who also don&#8217;t worry about high levels of customization.  Android tablets are about freedom and customization.  Both tablets have very similar core capabilities.  It really comes down to preference.  If you are sold on Android, don&#8217;t fear the investment in the Samsung Galaxy Tab S.  It is simply worth it.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is my first Android tablet and I am absolutely blown away by the screen resolution!

The video is so crisp and clear.

Look at the big picture, what you want from a tablet now, a year from now, what your family needs out of this and make a decision.8.4-inch Galaxy Tab S tablet: 2560x1600, 359 ppi, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, 8-core, 1900 MHz, ARM Cortex-A15 & ARM Cortex-A7, 3 GB RAM, 32GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD card slot (up to 128 GB), Camera: 8MP rear-facing, 2.1MP front-facing and weighs 10.51 oz (298 g) Android 4.4.210.5-inch Galaxy Tab S tablet: 2560x1600, 288 ppi, Exynos 5 Octa 5420, 8-core, 1900 MHz, ARM Cortex-A15 & ARM Cortex-A7, 3 GB RAM, 32GB built-in storage (ROM), a microSD card slot (up to 128 GB), Camera: 8MP rear-facing, 2.1MP front-facing and weighs 16.47 oz (467 g)Android 4.4.2Both have same specs, apart from weight, battery, ppi and size, of course.I am not going into other details like accelerometer etc. as they are all standard these days, Audio support - AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA\/ASF, 3GA\/M4A, FLAC, WAV; MP3\/MP4\/Music Tones; Music Player; Ringtones, Polyphonic. Video support: AVI\/DIVX, WMV\/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4\/3GP, WEBM; Video Player; Video Streaming. SD card capability is awesome! With prices plummeting for microSD GB cards, it is a great boon. Put all your music, books, photos on the SD card and you have a powerful computer in hand always! I personally use the 128 GB microSD card on my mobile devices. This tablet has both bluetooth 4.0&#34; and have USB Host capability. USB Host is one of the most under noticed features of Androids and is in my opinion one of the best features compared to iPad lines. What this means you get a USB Host cable also otherwise called OTG (On the Go) cables and plug in your USB thumb drive or other USB devices and the device recognizes it. I have used it with Alfa AWUS036H for a wireless project with Android PCAP Capture from reputable Kismet wireless. GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I personally use Navigon from Garmin and have downloaded several apps.Finally, believe me; don't get mired in the spec game. All devices perform most of common functions.7&#8221; Tab is smallest, portable8&#8221; Tab is bigger, readable8.4&#8221;\/8.5&#8221; S TAB PRO awesome crisp resolution - Best pixel density of all 6 Tab 4, Tab S, Ta and TAB Pro versions10.1&#8221; TAB gameplay10.1&#8221; TabPro \/  10.5&#8221; S games\/books\/sharper resolution12.2&#8221; Bring on the books and Glossy magazines!If you are reading books, browsing, listening to music, looking at photos, playing games 10.1&#34;is definitely great. Samsung is creating markets for all form factors and I would consider this as an exploratory stage. Just like Ford or Toyota has cars in different shapes, sizes and price range, so are the tablet vendors now. Remember the laptop wars, 10&#34;, 12&#34; 13&#34;, 15, 17 and even some 19&#34; if I remember right few years ago. We used to debate endlessly which laptop sizes are better, which has better speakers and so on. The time has come to fight it out for tablets!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome. A tablet is only as good as the apps you have and how productive it makes you. It's almost like the camera\/lens analogy in the DSLR space. What good it is to have a great DSLR body if you have no good lens? Same with Tablet body and apps you have.I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.

If you have doubts shoot me a comment, I can help! I hope the key specs I have consolidated here of all the tablets will help you narrow down and help in buying the right tablet for your needs.","rating":5},{"comment":"I spent a lot of time researching the right tablet for me, and finally decided to wait for this one. I'm incredibly satisfied,  this tablet is wonderful. The screen is jaw-dropping. Great features. I've basically hooked this up to everything in my house (tv, cable box, computer, printer) and it was all a breeze.","rating":5},{"comment":"Samsung's Tab S is a strong rival to the iPad Air, but for those who own other Apple products the iPad Air may remain the obvious choice.so check before you buy","rating":3},{"comment":"I question every review over 3 Stars on the Galaxy Tab S as either premature or paid reviews because my experience can no way be isolated. I had my Tab S for 9 days and in that time I experienced why this tablet was years away from even a slight comparison to the iPad. To be clear, I am NOT a fan of Apple products.First, the screen is beautiful. The colors on images and videos pop right out. It's an eye catching experience just looking at the technology of an Amoled screen. Size and weight are also perfect but that is where the positive attributes end.First, I travel quite a bit and this tablet was for movies on the plane, reading books and magazines and catching up on email. You cannot access or play your Amazon Prime library as Amazon only supports Amazon tablets for downloading and playing movies. At least on the iPad you can play your Prime movies. Not on the Tab S, you are just dead in the water. You can however access Flickster movies and save them to Dropbox, which works well.After viewing movies, I noticed images and videos were blurred from frame to frame and the darks were very distorted. I tried changing the display setting but nothing worked. When reading web pages or books and magazines on the first few pages would be in view and others were blurry. Nothing seemed to correct this either. I brought my Tab S into Best Buy they were aware of this issue and had seen it on a few returns. So in other words, nothing you can do to correct it.The camera is great and pics are crisp and clear. For me, a camera on a tablet is a bit useless but I was impressed with the clarity of images.Now to the big issue which caused me to return my Galaxy Tab S. Latency and Lag. If you are clicking on an app, using the back button or just navigating from task to task, you will find yourself waiting for the tablet to catch up to you. For has powerful as this thing is in terms of Specs, it is slow and locks up quite a bit. It is frustrating because it happens all the time and is not isolated from one area to another. This was the back breaker for me. Not to mention no access to Outlook for email when the Samsung email client will not sync Outlook sub-folders and is outdated. People told me to download 3rd party apps to make email work. That makes no sense. It works on the iPad, Surface, Google and Asus tablets without a 3rd party app so why is Samsung so far behind in technology?I almost forgot, Battery life is 6 to 7 hours in real time use. Where they are coming up with 9 to 10 is amazing.All and all, the Galaxy Tab S is a huge disappointment. Sure the screen is nice but over a short period of time you start to realize that everything else is below par. I would not recommend this tablet to anyone especially with the huge price point.","rating":1},{"comment":"Boot up time about 30 seconds. Quick and snappy. Incredible looking screen! I bought a keyboard and mouse to go along with it. This is big enough for me to replace a laptop and other much slower systems. I replaced touchwiz with Nova Launcher and can place all my icons on one home screen. Some difficulties in connecting an external hd.","rating":5},{"comment":"With the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 10.5, Samsung finally got their Android tablet right. Having used the previous variations of the Galaxy Tab back to the first 7 inch version, this is by far the best Android tablet out there. The tablet is light, though not quite on par with the Sony Xperia Z2 Tablet, and it is thin. The screen is gorgeous and the battery life is much improved.I am not completely sold on a fingerprint sensor for a tablet, though. Maybe for business use, but for personal use, not quite.ProsLightweight & thinGorgeous displayFast, even with TouchWizGreat battery life, roughly 9-11 hours with 8-9 hours of screen time using low brightnessSmaller bezels - finallyDual speakers!!!ConsTouchWiz still isn't the best UI. I installed Nova Launcher for a better experience.Bloatware - But this isn't a Nexus device so it was to be expectedSmaller bezels - where can I put my hands without interrupting the scrolling experience?Physical buttons - come on, Samsung, it's 2014. On screen buttons should be the standard.Speaker location - could be on the front. Hey, at least we got two!Conclusion: Overall, the tablet is a vast improvement over previous Samsung offerings and near the top of the list for Must-Have Android tablets.","rating":4},{"comment":"I find it funny how people complain about price when smartphones off contract can cost $699 or $799 and this is a full PC that runs apps and programs starting at $799 (with pen\/ without the keyboard). The 64g and 128g IPad costs $699 and $799 respectively with no stylus or covers (I know lots of people who buy these at this price and don't give it a second thought). People also complain about the extra cost for the type cover but IPad doesn't offer one included in the price either.Some people say compare it to the MacBook pro. To that I say they're both great but the mac doesn't offer a touch screen or stylus input. How much extra would it cost if it did?I like apple products. They are well made and work well. They certainly deserve the reputation they've created. That doesn't mean I have to bash another product that is also well made and works well. You can love one brand and it not be a betrayal of that love to acknowledge the good qualities of another brand\/product.Surface pro 3 is an awesome device and unlike some others I believe the cost is justified.I'm sure people will hate what I've had to say but I speak the truth. Apple is great and now apparently Microsoft has also created a great device. They deserve their props for that like them or not.","rating":5},{"comment":"What a beautiful piece of technology. I was skeptical about MS Pro products but when I saw this thing at the local MS Store, I immediately fell in love with it. Since I am going to school in less than two months, I was already thinking about getting something that is both portable and yet versatile enough to watch videos and play some games when I am not suffering in school.I never had a surface pro 2 but I took sometime comparing the two at the store and I have to say the third generation looks a lot better. The upgraded screen looks fantastic and much more detailed than the previous generation. Although you have to pay almost $130 more in addition to the pro 3 for the keyboard, it is almost a must-buy because the keyboard is really the reason why surface pro 3 is such a great product. A lot of reviewers online complained about how the keyboard still does not provide the best typing experience, however, I feel like it is more than adequate. The touchpad though, as many people pointed out, feels shallow but it is hard to complain when there is only that much space to work with. As I am typing this review right now on the new surface pro 3, I don't really think I am typing on a mobile keyboard. Surface pro 3 comes with a Micro SD extension slot so you can expand the storage as you wish. The USB slot is a life saver and something tablets like iPad air (which I own) desperately needs. A relatively fluent Windows 8 user, I find the OS much more intuitive running on a touch screen. Give it a run I am sure most fluent Windows 7 or even XP user would have little issue with it. The new pen is a very nice touch. Writing notes now is much easier. I spent fifteen minutes to set this little thing up and used it immediately in a meeting this afternoon and I had a pretty pleasant time with it.Overall, through a day of usage, this little thing has already made me very very happy. To those who are thinking about getting a ultra book or a tablet for school, give Surface Pro 3 a try. I really think it is a very nice companion for students and business people who want more functionality than tablets without the extra weights of laptops or even ultra books.P.S. Students and Teachers get 10% off. People at the store didn't even confirm me as a student so maybe you can get it also without actually being a student or teacher. GOOD LUCK!Update 1.........................................................................................................................................................................................I have been streaming World Cup on this little thing and can I just say it is getting crazy in Brazil!?While I was talking with my friends, I have noticed a lot of the geeky ones still think this is a VERY expensive investment for ANYONE. $1,200 is a lot of money to pay for anything for a college student. It is true but what you are getting in return is a FULL computer that can also be a tablet. You might be able to get similarly spec'ed PC somewhere else for $700 but you probably won't be able to get something that is this portable and versatile. If you are replacing a very old laptop, this, IMO, isn't a very expensive choice. But if you have surface pro 2 or anything that is similar, this is probably a pretty expensive upgrade. Make sure you evaluate you situation fully so you can make the most appropriate decision.P.S. I was so excited and just wanted to share my happiness with everyone. WANT TO RUN ANDROID OS ON YOUR SURFACE? Go to [...]. You will be able to take advantage of a massive number of android apps from Google Play Store. I thought this single emulator just made Surface that much more versatile. GOOD LUCK!","rating":5},{"comment":"I've had a lot of tablets, and a lot of laptops. I am a big fan of this kind of gadgets, and I love to try new things. This one is, until now, the best one I've had. It is a GREAT product and, in my opinion, it does replace your tablet and your laptop, all into a one single device. Recomended.","rating":5},{"comment":"The product was released yesterday in Canada and I went out to Future Shop and was that store's first buyer for the unit. They had to search for it from the back to sell me one from their first shipment. I have it now for 24 hours and am ready to report that the previews from professional reviewers have been accurate. It won't be your desktop replacement and it won't replace a true blue tablet, but for the traveler and those who need a full-scale Windows PC and an occasional tablet, it's close to perfect.Let me get the gripes out of the way: Windows 8.1. I've been using W8.0 and 8.1 since they came out but I still immediately downloaded ClassicShell and installed it. The new 8.1 UI just doesn't cut it for me. I need my Computer (My PC) icon often for the first few weeks of any PC as I personalize the various setting beyond what's available in the Control Panel. Secondly, the battery life is only so-so--seems like 6-8 hours. Not quite tablet territory but it's good enough for the business user for the day without carrying the charger brick around and that's sufficient.Now, what's good:1. It's only slightly heavier than my Samsung Note 2 10.1 and it's full-function Windows!2. Start up from scratch is within 15 seconds. Wake up from sleep is as fast as any tablet.3. The new keyboard is ingenious. The rigidity is good enough and the key placements are intuitive. I have been using a Lenovo Yoga 2 for a year now and I still hit the wrong keys all the time. Not with this keyboard that I'm using now. The slight fold to give it a tilt is amazingly simple and effective. It does make touching the bottom icons a bit awkward but, hey, there is a good touch pad! My only gripe is the two-key function keys but I got used to it fast and we do have to realize it's a compact design. Touch type is totally acceptable, better than any detachable keyboard I've ever used. Pricey and extra but great design.4. Smooth screen scrolling. The first Surface touch screen was not the best (never bothered with Surface 2) and this one is smooth and sensitive.5. The pen is easy to use. The first time you use the pen it gives you a 15-second tutorial on how to use the buttons. It uses a cloth holder with a glue tape that you attach to the cover. It seems to hold it well but the durability remains to be seen. Downside is that if you detach the keyboard then you have to make sure you put the pen in your pocket. It seems a bit silly because when you don't have the keyboard is when you need the pen the most. However, this is insufficient as a flaw to knock off a star.6. I save the best for the last: the display. I'm outside in the backyard typing this. It's sunny and I can see the screen with shades on. The display is fine and bright; 1440, I think. This beats most ultra books out there for sure. If you're like me who use multiple windows open side by side, the aspect ratio and the fine display make it feasible on such a small unit.I fly weekly to go to work. This baby will surely go with me. Since it's a tablet, and Canadian airlines now allow digital units (but not notebook computers) to be used at all time with airplane mode, I can use this uninterrupted throughout the flight without having to compromise full Windows functionality.Highly recommended for those who don't mind the slightly higher price and would appreciate a full-function and compact PC that can double as an occasional tablet.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Surface Pro 3 is the best Tablet PC ever made. It's not a gaming PC but if you are looking for a tablet where you can browse the web without restrictions of any type, create and edit any type of Office document, again, without any type of limitations, Save and organize your files and folders anywhere and in anyway you want, the Surface Pro 3 is your Tablet. You don't need to jailbreak it or anything like that. And you have the biggest library of Software available to you.","rating":5},{"comment":"I'm building a house and needed a device to use on site to view pdf's, websites, Sketchup files, and images. Android tablets were out because I need to run Sketchup and I wanted to easily transfer files within my existing Windows homegroup. I considered an inexpensive tablet like the Asus Transformer but I went with the Surface because of the built-in kickstand and good reviews about the build quality. So far, I haven't been disappointed.Using a tablet as a viewing device is far superior to a traditional laptop with keyboard because you don't have that keyboard getting in the way. It's much easier to walk around holding a tablet. When you want to show someone something, it's nice to hand them a tablet which is as simple as handing them a piece of paper. When you set the tablet down, you can lean it against a wall or use the kickstand to put it unobtrusively on a desk.Don't discount how valuable the built-in kickstand is. It allows you to prop it on a table for hands-free viewing. It takes up much less desk space propped up which is nice when you are just charging it. The kickstand is THE key feature differentiating the Surface from all the competitors at this time.This is my first foray into Windows 8 and there is definitely a learning curve coming from Windows 7. I would recommend actually reading the \"Surface Pro 3 User Guide\" available at the Microsoft website. Once you figure out what all the different swiping motions do, things get a lot easier.Networking a Windows 8 tablet with my existing Windows 7 homegroup was a snap. No issues there whatsoever.The Surface connects easily to my Verizon phone \"Mobile Hotspot\" giving me internet access on the road.Surfing the internet is fast and accurate just like a desktop. Signing in to Chrome allows me to have all my bookmarks and settings instantly up to date. It's much better in this regard than my Kindle Fire HDX which can't run Chrome and has a slow and clunky browser.Viewing Sketchup files works very well. It's easy to move, rotate, and pinch-to-zoom. To create content, you'll want a keyboard and mouse though.Minor negatives:-Proprietary charger.-The fan can get a bit whiny.-It is a little heavier than expected but not a big deal.-Windows 8 can be a pain to deal with until you get everything configured the way you want and even then.-Because the screen is so big, typing on the virtual keyboard takes a lot longer than on your smartphone. Typing in websites and short emails is no problem but you won't want to do anything more than that without the hard keyboard.Overall, this is a fantastic viewing device. It runs all your windows programs so anything you view on your desktop, you can view on the Surface. It is thin, well-built, and has a great screen. The built-in kickstand is extremely useful and I can't imagine being without it.","rating":5},{"comment":"I am a graphic designer and illustrator. I do the drawings, designs, and sending emails a lot everyday. Previously, I used Samsung Note 12.2 for drawing and note purpose. However, it was not as comfortable as the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 for the drawings.It is not accurate as Wacom tablet or Samsung Note 12.2 (recent version), however it is still beatable for all other tablets.","rating":5},{"comment":"The SP3 is one of the most impressive pieces of technology I've ever used. It can also be really confusing, because it's really multi-modal.1. It runs all normal Windows desktop applications.  It also runs all the tablet mode windows applications.  This can lead to some problems.  First off, the tablet mode is totally different than the desktop mode.  This is fine, but it can get confusing where the modes overlap.  Ex. there's a tablet internet browser and a desktop internet browser.  Which one should you use?  There's a settings page in tablet-land, and there's all the normal control panel settings.  Are they the same?  To switch applications, you can slide your finger from the left side of the screen (to Microsoft's credit, this is slick-as-hell).  But you can also alt-tab when you're in desktop land.  To run split screen apps, you can use a slide-in-from-the-side finger gesture.  But you can also be in the desktop and snap them to the sides of the screen (or resize the windows however you want).  These types of multi-tasking don't work exactly the same, so when you're doing something, you can really get thrown off when you notice that there's no title bar to drag the program over there, etc.2. There are a huge number of slightly-different input methods.  Of course, you can use a keyboard and mouse and use it just like a normal Windows laptop or desktop.  But you can also use finger input. Then there's also a pen input.  It doesn't behave exactly like fingers (ex., in a web browser, dragging the pen around typically highlights text, whereas your finger will usually scroll around).  This can be nice, assuming the program you're using supports it consistently.  Then there's also support for touchpad on the keyboard cover.  That's four pointer inputs (mouse, pen, finger, touchpad).  For keyboards, if you don't have a keyboard, then one will pop up on the screen when you need it (sometimes... but other times you have to click the little icon and bring it up yourself).  Even the onscreen keyboard has like 4 modes (normal keyboard, split keyboard, writing-to-text, and some other mystery mode that it wouldn't ever let me select).  It just seems like way too many options for the average user.The actual device is pretty incredible.  It's super thin, looks great, solid construction, thermals are kept in check pretty well.  Fan occasionally comes and you can definitely hear it, but it's not that big of a deal.  Screen is really sharp and looks great.  Overall, for the amount of performance you get, I think it's priced pretty fairly (actually, I suspect Microsoft's margins are really low on it).  Battery life is great.  Miscellaneous stuff: The power connector is a cool magnetic thing (which they kinda copied from a certain competitor in Cupertino, but it still works great).  Also, the power charger has an extra USB port for charging, which I'm in love with.  No need to bring a separate wall wart around to charge your cell phone, just plug a charging cable in there.  The kickstand is really solid and can open to any angle.  The (sold separately) type cover is pretty nice, although I do end up making a lot of typing mistakes on it.  It's a full size keyboard, so it's not that bad. I'm just not used to some of the key placements. (If you buy this tablet, you should probably buy that too since it's obviously an intended part of the overall design.)But even though these hardware features are well implemented, in actual use, I tend to spend too much time messing around with them.  Should I plug in a mouse?  Nah, the pen is good enough.  But wait, the pen isn't as precise or fast as a mouse! And it's annoying to have my hand in the way whenever I'm selecting stuff!  Better go get the mouse.  What angle should I put the kickstand at?  Hmm wait this task is more well suited for portrait orientation, I'll switch to that.  Oh wait now my keyboard doesn't connect at that angle.  Basically, I find that when I'm using it, I spend too much time thinking about these kinds of things and not enough time working.  It's the paradox of choice, distilled directly into computer form.Speaking of usage modes: as a tablet, it's just way too big.  The corners are sharp and uncomfortable to hold. As a laptop, it's a bit better.  I think that's why they're pitching it against the MacBook Air.  One usage model that it supports beautifully is as a digital notepad.  Press the back button of the stylus and it takes you into OneNote.  For a student, I can see this being awesome - all of your notes are in one place, you can tag them and categorize them, you can write them or type them, you can draw a diagram just as easy as you would on paper.  If you can get a digital copy of your textbook, you can have it opened right next to your notepad.There are currently some early-adopter woes going on.  Pen pressure level support is really spotty. I couldn't find any free paint program that supports it well. (the included MS OneNote supports it fully and it's awesome there.  So I really don't have any doubts that the hardware itself is capable.  But OneNote is not really a paint program, so it doesn't really fit the job.).  There are some weird wifi issues which I think are software related and will probably eventually get a fix.  Also, the screen looks great and is pretty high pixel density, but not all software scales up all the interface elements correctly.  Every once in a while, you'll find a teeny tiny close button or icon, or a misaligned text box, or one of a zillion other issues like this.  It's more of an industry issue, and hard to pin the blame totally on Microsoft, but it's an issue nonetheless.Basically, Microsoft has made another tablet the same way they've been making tablets since they started making them way back in 2002.  They tried to jam a whole desktop computer in there.  To their credit, this is probably the best they've ever done.  It can be really compelling, and certainly its functionality it blows the competition out of the water.  But it can also be really confusing and complicated.  I think to really love this device, you kind of have to be a techie who loves finagling around with different options and inputs and modes and stuff.  So, the device itself is absolutely fantastic; and if it suits your usage model, then I 100% recommend it.  I just think that's probably a pretty small audience.","rating":5},{"comment":"This  is awesome.  It initially became my new assistant and the companion.

Had Apple come out with a retina display for it I probably would have. That being said, I gave this a shot and really like it. I do not like Windows 8 on a desktop having to use only a mouse. On a tablet I think it works very well. Yes, it has some issues that will most likely be addressed with 9 comes out. The Surface Pro 3 itself is amazing IMHO. I love having a tablet with this size screen. Yes, it weighs a bit more because of it, but it is balanced extremely well so you really don't notice it that much (although the placement of the windows button causes me some issues when holding it in landscape mode). The newly designed kickstand in back is a work of art. That ability to put it in so many positions is awesome and extremely handy. The screen is also a work of beauty and the new keyboard works really well. Even the track pad is a big improvement over the Pro 2's.The only real knocks I have with the SP 3 is the battery life, charging extra for the keyboard and a proprietary charger. Battery life is not terrible, but not great either. If Microsoft really wants to push this as a laptop\/tablet combo they should include a keyboard. I am not a fan of proprietary chargers (and I am still with Apple lol). The charger is actually very nice otherwise although I wish I could disable the light since I keep it in bed.Microsoft has nearly created the perfect device for me. As apps continue to fill the store and Microsoft releases 9 beta later this year, it will move the much closer to perfect for me.","rating":4},{"comment":"As an owner of the original Surface Pro, I realized the device was a compromise. The 16x9 aspect ratio left you in a position to work, but in a hampered fashion, as Office documents wouldn't fit a full page on the screen without scaling. The scaling in Desktop mode made working in things like Photoshop a pain, as you either had funky menus or you couldn't read the menus. The Surface Pro 3 has fixed much of this.I personally opted for the 256 GB with 8 GB of RAM model.If you are looking for a laptop replacement (assuming you buy the keyboard) and something that can double as a tablet, has the power to run all of your normal Windows programs and &#34;apps,&#34; then you may want to give the Surface Pro 3 a real consideration. I would recommend going to the Microsoft Store, assuming you have one in your area (if not, Best Buy) and check them out. Both stores have good return policies and you should know well before the 30 day return period whether this is a device for you.Longer review:Opening the box is pretty much the same experience as opening the Surface Pro. The gray and white box, with minimal design cues, separates to show you a plain white box surrounding your new device. The power adapter is hidden away, coming out of a &#34;hidden&#34; compartment, forcing you to focus just on the device and the pen. It's easy to open and easy to get started.If you hate Windows 8, you will be happy, maybe, to know that the Surface Pro 3 comes with Windows 8.1 Update. What this does is returns the ability to know whether you want to start to the desktop (for desktops and laptops without touch), or the start screen (with the tiles) for touch devices. Since the Surface Pro 3 is a touch device, it will boot into the tiles menu but you can change this easily.When you press the power button, the Pro 3 powers up quickly, or very quickly depending on how long ago you walked away from the device. From a complete power off, where you tell the Pro 3 to shutdown, you can be at the Start Screen in less than 25 seconds. If you power off by pressing the power button (which was moved to the upper left instead of the upper left) or shutting your type cover, the Surface Pro 3 goes into a quick sleep mode. In this mode, when you press the power button or Start button, the device is on and ready to run instantly. Turn off log on when the Surface goes to sleep and it really is instant on.If you hate Windows 8.1 Update, then you will hate the Surface Pro 3. I would recommend you try it with the Surface Pro 3 before completely dismissing the OS. The SP 3 really does a great job showcasing just what Windows 8.1 Update is all about.Beautiful. The screen resolution is 2160x1440 native, meaning it is a 3:2 aspect ratio, not 16x9. For me, this is a really good compromise between 4:3 and 16x9 aspect ratios. The bad part of this AR is that 16x9 content will have black borders. The bonus for this, and the reason I think I'm in love, is that the screen now is shaped more like a tablet or paper. This makes taking notes with the new Surface Pen a dream come true. One Note is magical with a pen. One Note, with a device shaped like a real tablet of paper, is a magical dream with unicorns.The touchscreen uses N-Trig instead of Wacom. Having come off the Pro and 1024 points of pressure and dropping down to &#34;only&#34; 256 points I thought would be overly noticeable. The thing is... after spending time with Photoshop and One Note, I can't really tell than I have around 1\/4 of the pressure sensitivity available. Really. So maybe the 1024 is a small bit of overkill? I am sure there are those out there that will notice the difference, but I struggle to feel or see a difference. I also don't spend my life in Photoshop and Lightroom, though I do love using both and am an advanced amateur with them.Turning the Surface from landscape to portrait mode switches as quickly as you expect and anticipate.One thing that bothered me at first, again coming from the Surface Pro, is they have moved the Start button that was on the bottom of the screen to the right side. This was done because the new type cover has an extra magnet in it that more firmly attaches itself to the Surface, creating a &#34;triangle&#34; shape in the rear of the keyboard, which means greater keyboard stability. After a few minutes with the new location, I'm pretty much fine with it. And since I'm using it more like a tablet of paper, in that configuration the button is still on the bottom. Only problem is, you can't use the keyboard in that configuration... which is OK as well since I use it in portrait for writing notes and drawing, so a keyboard isn't really needed... except in Photoshop which is a pain to try to use with a software keyboard.I sold my Surface Pro to buy the 3, so I am not sure if you can use all of the same accessories across models, such as the charger. It looks like it was redesigned and I'm almost positive that won't work. I've read that the keyboards work, but given the difference in aspect ratio difference, using an old keyboard will likely look a little ghetto AND you lose the ability of the keyboard to firmly attach on the SP 3, which is a big, big downside to the old keyboards.Battery life, for me, has been right around 8 hours on a full charge. This is watching YouTube videos, viewing photos, editing photos and general Internet browsing.The pen is simply amazing. The responsiveness I've experienced thus far is second to none in terms of feeling like writing on an actual tablet of paper. Using this in Photoshop, One Note and Fresh Paint really makes doodling on a computer, working on photos and taking notes... fun. I won't say I'd LOVE to work with this because you know, &#34;work&#34; is a four letter word, but it definitely makes things feel fresh.Another great function is the ability to click the pen and have One Note just open. This can happen whether the SP 3 is powered on or not. The downside is that not ALL of the buttons on the pen work in this mode, but you can easily take notes without any problems and they will synch to the last account logged in with One Note. Simply awesome.One thing I have to get used to though is on the Surface Pro you could flip the pen around and use the bottom as an &#34;eraser.&#34; Now you have to push one of the buttons on the pen to get this capability. It took about 5 minutes to get used to, but once you are used to it, no problem.The hinge on the back is nothing short of an engineering miracle. You can literally put the SP 3 in almost any angle you want, completely blowing away the Surface Pro's one option and the paltry 2 settings for the Surface 2 and Surface Pro 2. When I first saw this on the unveiling, I was worried because it's a hinge that would need to take a beating. I'm pleased to report that I have not a single concern about the hinge failing, and with the nearly limitless configurability of the angle, you won't miss your laptop\/ultrabook much at all.The new keyboard is fantastic as well. Tactile feedback is great and the backlight makes seeing it in the dark a breeze. The added magnet that firmly attaches the keyboard to the SP 3 forms a triangle at the base, meaning you have a much more sturdy connection for the keyboard, and in my lap and the hinge pushed back, I am struggling to see any bounding or limitation I didn't see on my ultrabook. Comparing this keyboard to the old Surface Pro keyboard, the old keyboard is laughable and in your laptop, laying flat, it was very difficult to use and the smallish size of the keys made using it a pain. Not so on the SP 3, at all.Cons\/Downsides:The track pad is nicer than previous models, but still small which is a con. The other big con for me is that the keyboard is a requirement for using this as an ultrabook\/laptop replacement, but it is a $130 addition. If you are buying a SP 3, buy a keyboard with it.On the downside, I think that the half baked attempt by Adobe to provide a more &#34;tablet friendly&#34; interface falls on its face and breaks its nose. Using the standard interface on a high DPI screen in Photoshop is doable, but certainly not ideal. During the Surface Pro 3 unveiling, it looked like MS and Adobe had solved this, and in fact it was a selling point for the SP 3. The problem is, in actual use, the workaround Adobe implemented makes using Photoshop annoying and much more difficult. For those not aware, Windows scales your icons and text to make them more legible on the SP 3 (and on high DPI displays in general). What Adobe has done, is they added an &#34;experimental&#34; option in the menus to scale Photoshop's menus by 200%. Well, once you enable this, when you open say, the Edit menu, you have to scroll down through all of the options, not everything is available to you anymore like it is without the scaling. You have to scroll down through the menus to have everything available. The images are cool and look great, editing is fun, but you have to chose between having all menu options available OR super small screen text.Another potential downside is Hyper-V support breaks the quick power on from standby capability. The Win 8.1 Update implementation of Hyper-V cannot support the new power mode, so it disables it, meaning your SP 3 feels more like a computer and less like a tablet. There are workarounds, but it's still a con in my opinion... IF you plan on using Hyper-V (most people won't, so it's more for us techy, geeky folks).One big annoyance is what is known as a Day One update. The SP 3 had some sleep and power issues during the press trial offered during the unveiling, and since the SP 3 was likely already deep in manufacturing at that point, it was unlikely the latest updates would make it onto the device. Sadly, this IS the case, so the first thing you will want to do, once you've turned on and setup the device is go and grab the updates from Windows Update. And be sure to check again after the first update. I had a couple minor Windows 8.1 Update updates to grab as well. This process easily added 30-45 minutes to the setup process, 30-45 minutes I was still over anxiously awaiting to tick away so I could &#34;play&#34; with my new technological marvel. Thankfully the Kid on Christmas feeling lasted well more than the initial setup and I'm happy, very happy, with my new laptop replacement.Overall:I love the SP 3. There are some compromises to be made and some caveats to work around, but overall it is an amazing device that offers a big screen (compared to other tablets, on the small side for a laptop but it's focusing on being an ultrabook replacement not a laptop)Near limitless angle on the hinge, being able to push the SP 3 down to a nearly horizontal angle, makes this a designer's fantasy come true.The power of a laptop in a tablet means you can throw just about anything at the SP 3 and be confident it will run without a hitch. High end gaming isn't really possible, but games look good enough for most uses.Pros include the updated keyboard, the fantastic pen, the beautiful display and the overall plain, simple FUN of using it.Cons include the keyboard not being included and Windows desktop mode scaling not being completely figured out for things like Photoshop (outside of PS, things like Office look and act wonderfully and are super easy to use).Highly, very, very highly recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"This review is for the Core-i5, 128GB $999 model.Whoa. If all you were looking for was a one-word review, that is the word I would use.My parents wanted a tablet. I wanted to make sure to get them a Windows tablet because that is what they know best, not android or apple. I didn't want to get them one of those budget tablets (Dell Venue Pro 8, Yoga Miix 2, etc.) because I wanted it to have some power. I was initially checking out the Surface Pro 2, but I think they really needed the 12&#34; screen (aging parents, aging vision). And fortunately, I heard news of the Surface Pro 3 right around the time I was looking SP2 and I am now glad I waited. It is an amazing system, amazing amazing system.I have fooled around with other similarly powered units, but the SP3 is just a much better machine in so many ways.Frankly, there are only a few other devices which match up in terms of specs (resolution, processor, screen size). Dell XPS 12, Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga, HP Spectre X2, MS Surface Pro 2 was about it. Every other convertible I saw (ASUS Taichi, Acer Aspire S7, Toshiba Portege, or anything else that I came across) either had 768p resolution (yuck), a 3xxx series Core i3\/i5 (I wanted the newest 4xxx series!) or a sub 12&#34; screen (e.g. the Dell XPS 11 is nice, but 11&#34; screen...ehhhh). The few machines that did pass my litmus test of specs had issues. Dell XPS 12 apparently has a ghosting issue which has gone unsolved. ThinkPad Yoga has a problem with displaying yellow colors. Spectre X2 looks and is priced decent, and doesn't have the issues of the Yoga or Dell, but at 13.3&#34; I thought it is a bit big (I think 12.5&#34; is the upper limit of comfortable tablets). The MS SP2 looked attractive, but 10.6&#34;, for my parents, seemed too small.So the device itself is just an amazing performer. That i5-4300 processor keeps things speedy. Now, my parents are not playing video games, so I won't ever know how the SP3 handles games, but that was never an issue. The screen is brilliant. By default the brightness is turned down a bit, but on full brightness it is wonderful. The touch feedback is top notch. It is so good that I can use the on-screen keyboard as if it was a real keyboard. Of course, the inability to feel edges of keys like a physical keyboard does make for frequent typos. The stylus (included) is very high quality and very responsive. My only complaint about the pen is that the tablet does not have somewhere to put the pen. Now, the keyboard addon, $129, does have a place, but I opted not to buy it since my parents were looking for just the tablet functionality. The heat is never an issue. There is a built-in fan that cools the unit should heat increase. During 100% CPU load the fan is noticeable, but nothing that I would deem annoying. Otherwise, I would never know there is a fan during normal load. Both the front and rear facing cameras are stellar. The pictures are crisp, and vivid (I'm no photography major, so maybe they are ish compared to a real camera, but whatever, it is a tablet not a DSLR camera. My android tablet has a pretty junky camera on it). Boot speed is lightning quick. The power jack takes its cues from the Apple laptops - magnetic, with protection against tripping. A nice little bonus is the power-USB port on the power block.Ports are a little lacking, I will admit. It comes with a headphone jack, a single USB3 port, a TFcard reader and a single mini-display port (along with the expected power port). That's the bare limit of what I would expect on any tablet these days (albeit a mini-USB port instead of a USB3 port for thinner models like my own android tablet). Considering the size and thickness of the SP3, as well as the fact that this is a Windows device, I would expect to see at least a second USB port, or mic jack.Battery life is good. I think it gets 2+ hours using full processor (I was getting addicted to my mom's Hoyle card games which was using full processor. After a couple hours the battery was running pretty low). Normal usage with the web, on full brightness gets like 4 hours? I mean I never take the device so far away from the power jack for there to be an issue.The hard drive had 93GB out of the box. After MS Office 2013, it dropped to 89 or so. It seems like you might be ok with the 64GB model if you were trying to save money.The only complaints I have are nothing specific to the device itself, but rather to Microsoft software and surface support. The Windows 8 market, after all these years, still stinks. There are specialized apps that come from major websites and the sort (Slingbox, Weather Channel, etc.) but the app development from individuals still isn't there. It is so hard to find any apps that do cool functions. You are just better off finding some tried and true windows desktop applications. Those, unfortunately, don't integrate into the Metro interface, but...whatever. Chrome still seems to have issues with the surface input in Metro mode. When I try to type in the address bar while in Metro mode it crashes. Internet Explorer is a bit stupid. The Metro mode is awesome, but it is available ONLY if you set Internet Explorer as the default web browser. While the keyboard button is always there for you to click on the taskbar, i would expect that the surface would recognize when you access a text-input area the way Android does. It is really hit or miss with this. Chrome and Internet Explorer support it, Firefox doesn't. I also don't like how the keyboard is missing some necessary buttons. I still find myself accessing the legacy &#34;On Screen Keyboard&#34; desktop application for certain buttons (e.g. Delete button, F1-F12 buttons). And of course, all the accessories are a bit pricey - $129 for the keyboard attachment, $29 for the case.If I didn't already have a love affair with my core i7 laptop that is going strong, I would definitely buy a Surface Pro 3 for myself. $1000 for is definitely not too much to ask for a machine of this quality and performance. Heck, I think you might be OK with the $800 Core-i3 model as long as you can accept having a 64GB drive that probably will leave you with around 35-40GB of space after Windows and Office.","rating":5},{"comment":"Traded in my Surface Pro and Dell Venue Pro 8 and bought the Pro 3. Totally worth it.  This is truly a great device.","rating":4},{"comment":"I am not going to list all the feature and comparisons of the surface pro 3, since most of the reviewers already gave out those information. I am just going to talk about it based on my own experience with it, and how I feel about it.I work in calling center environment as a stock broker, and my daily job requires lots of note taking. I use one note extensively. For the last couple of days, I can have about 30 to 40% battery left after my shift ends which is about 8 hours. I use it sparingly, so I think 9 hour battery life claimed by Microsoft sounds reasonable. Notes taking is excellent, and is easy to use. Typing on the type keyboard feel sturdy, but I feel my finger is a little more tired than I type on my MacBook pro retina 15 inch. I think that's due to the bouncing effect from the keyboard, since there is a gap between keyboard and the table if I lift the front of the keyboard up.When I use it at home, I use mostly in tablet format. I used to own surface pro 1, and I know it's heavy when holding it for a long time. This one is lighter, but feels also heavy due to the big size. It's not ideal if you want to hold it for a long time. Surface pro feels cool when just browsing the internet, and it starts to run hot around the top right corner when playing games. My surface pro 1 is warm the whole body. I understand Microsoft moved the window icon to the center of right bezel so users can life the keyboard, but I find myself sometimes touch the button, and it goes to home screen as a result. Also after I lift up the keyboard, I then don't' have access or is difficult to access the menu bard on the bottom of the screen. I guess it's a tradeoff, since you get studier keyboard that way. But you can just not lift up the keyboard if you want to access the bottom menu easier. Screen is gorgeous similar to my surface pro 1, and I feel it's better than my iPad air. I also launched the PhotoShop, but it seems PhotoShop hasn't upgrade its menu bar, the menu title are all very small, and it's very difficult to access them even I increase its size to biggest. Reading eBook isn't ideal at all in portrait mode. Maybe you can live with it in landscape mode. Kickstand is awesome, but you need to push a little harder for it to bend. All in all, I think this tablet works best in laptop mode with keyboard attached. I will update more info as I go.","rating":5},{"comment":"I could buy the best top of the line laptop for half that price!

Plus using the same Microsoft account, just about everything synced over since all my stuff is on OneDrive.I bought mine at the Microsoft store in Southern California where I applied a 10% student discount plus a trade-in to bring the price down.I have to say the best things about my SP3 are:1. Bigger screen\/Great resolutionSP3 is being used more often in all modes.  I'd usually hook the SP1 to a monitor to use as a desktop, change to tablet mode if just wanted to do some light surfing or use apps, then every now and then use the SP1 as a laptop.  Now with the SP3, the use cases for desktop, laptop, and tablet are pretty much the same (i.e., I use them in all modes all the time, not one more than the other).  So, its become my daily driver in all modes.2. Light and thin.  Goes wherever I go.3. Keyboard is much improved4. Pen feels better to use.5. The 3:2 aspect ratio6. The 150 degree kickstand7. The trackpad is way better. I don't have to go looking for my Bluetooth mouse that often anymore.8. Longer battery life.  I can pretty much go through an entire workday before I have to recharge.I think Microsoft read my SP1 user questionnaire and addressed any gripes I had about the first Surface Pro.

I'm sure there are more things that I love about this device but that is all I can think of, for now, on a Sunday morning.","rating":5},{"comment":"","rating":5},{"comment":"It is a great device, Microsoft has a really good one on it's hands.A little about me:I am a techie, I own all kinds of computers, I have 2 gaming laptops (i7's, high end dedicated gpu's) and 2 gaming desktops that I built as well. I own an 32GB Ipad Mini Retina Display, and a 32GB Google Nexus 7 2013 edition.I have also owned a lot of computers in the past. Some basic and some with serious horsepower under the hood.I've wanted a Surface Pro from the 1st gen on and finally after a lot of patience I finally am the proud owner of a Surface Pro 3!While this hybrid of a machine doesn't replace my laptops fully that is only because of the power that the laptops have.It HAS pretty much replaced my tablets though.This HAS also become my grab and go device thanks to the fact that it can run full blown Windows Software, and it's REALLY nice to install just about anything to it. No worries about if there is 'an app for that' which there isn't always one in my case, though I'll admit that it's rare. It's full fledged Windows! The Windows Store has a lot of apps and while it's not as filled as Apple or Google one only needs to remember, you CAN install just about all your older Windows software. I installed Office 2007 because I'm not ready to completely rely on the cloud. That and my internet can bug out at times. But I do like using the cloud to sync my devices and to use for backup of my more important documents and pictures. So like the hybrid device I am a hybrid user!I went with the 256GB\/8GB model as I discovered that you can't upgrade the ram and unless you want to break your device you can't really upgrade the SSD either. I figured for what my uses where the 256GB would suffice and I can always add more with the microSD card slot so it was no biggie.My impressions thus far is it is a wonderful hybrid.I walked into this with the thought of this being a tablet first and a laptop second. (I wanted a tablet that could run Windows software.) To that aspect it has far exceeded my expectations, but what I didn't count on was it is also a decent laptop. I can very easily sit on my bed and watch tv while typing or playing a few games.Gaming wise, this won't blow you away, you can play a few games but don't expect it to go on 'high' settings or such. The big shine though is because I have a gaming desktop I can use Steam's Game streaming service where the desktop will render the game and then stream it to the Surface. Now that turns it into a gaming system! I haven't really tested it heavily but it works.The built in kickstand is really nice and I ended up missing it when I went to my ipad mini for some quick references (couldn't remember all my email addresses)A few minor annoyances that I am welling to let go.Occasionally I need to disconnect the type cover and reconnect it, I don't know if its the Surface or the cover that got confused, but it's something.I also needed to reboot the device as it stops responding, but this has honestly happened only 2 times and I think I may have been pushing it a little too far with the multi-tasking. (2x Virtual Machines, while running a Minecraft server AND attempting to Stream a steam game as well as having about 12 tabs open in chrome.) I forgot all this was going on, oops. So this is probably more of a my bad as I AM used to higher powered devices, but the fact that it really didn't lock up until I launched Steam Streaming I think is pretty dang good for such a small device. (Honestly I was planning on trying to push it to it's limits but wasn't ready to test. This was more by accident and a whoopsie.)It is a bit heaver than my Ipad mini, but when I look at the power under the hood I tend to get positive about it, just don't expect it to weigh the same or less than that.Another gripe and it's kind of big but isn't really to do with the Surface itself but with the type cover (which will be reviewed) is that the sleeve that the Pen goes into just has a sticky side to it that you stick to the type cover where you want, if your not careful it WILL fall off thus losing your precious pen. I have started clipping my pen to the cover in the hinge area where the double fold is with the pen on the outside of the cover when closed. It fits perfectly. I may glue the sleeve to the cover sometime, but I'm gonna wait for my return window to expire before doing so.The pen: It is wonderful to write with! I am a lefty so trying to write on ANY screen has been heck for me. Finally with an active pen this allows me to rest my hand ON the screen while writing on OneNote or messing around drawing. The only draw back I have is the pen uses 3x batteries, 2x cell batteries for the &#34;OneNote&#34; button which itself is very nice, but when they die chances are I won't replace them. The other battery powers the pen itself. This battery is the concern of mine. It's a 'AAAA' not an 'AAA' or 'AA'. How long do these batteries last with a lot of use? I can't seem to find that out. And it's not an everyday battery you can just grab up. I did order some extras on here for backup though so I'm not too worried but it still would have been nice if it where maybe a 'AAA' instead as I had plenty of those including rechargeable versions.Despite these gripes none are really nothing for me to knock off any stars as I went in looking for a Tablet that could power through just about anything I could throw at it and it needed to run Windows native software. On this it far exceeds my expectations!USB port, full Windows use, room for expansion via the MicroSD card slot and even the USB port, bluetooth for headsets, a mouse and other devices a built-in kickstand is a nice added benefit that I hadn't considered until I had it. These are all good things and things I was wanting or discovered.I have yet to have the wifi issues, which possibly have been fixed since.Ultimately it has become my goto device for reading the news while eating breakfast, and doing a lot of general tasks that I would lug my large gaming laptop around and my tablets around for. So it HAS found a spot on my wonderful tech table, even making a spot due to moving a few devices to the side table. If devices had feelings I'm sure some would be crying about now.This review may change, be edited for better clarity, or edited as time passes on to reflect changes in opinion due to longetivity or other circumstances beyond my control, but I will do my best to keep the original review intact.Any questions, please feel free to ask and I will answer to the best of my knowledge.","rating":5},{"comment":"Best Windows 8 laptop out there. I've had now for a few weeks, and I love this device. Great screen, AMAZINGLY light, and the Type Keyboard's trackpad is finally good enough... i don't use the Arc Touch Mouse in my bag. Battery life is very good (I get about 7-8 hours). It's unfortunate that none of my original power adapters continue to work, but i let that slide because the new one is MUCH easier to attach.My Surface Pro 2 has served me well, but the larger screen, better keyboard, and thinner profile make this the Windows 8 device to beat right now.","rating":5},{"comment":"The product was released yesterday in Canada and I went out to Future Shop and was that store's first buyer for the unit. They had to search for it from the back to sell me one from their first shipment. I have it now for 24 hours and am ready to report that the previews from professional reviewers have been accurate. It won't be your desktop replacement and it won't replace a true blue tablet, but for the traveler and those who need a full-scale Windows PC and an occasional tablet, it's close to perfect.Let me get the gripe out of the way: Windows 8.1. I've been using W8.0 and 8.1 since they came out but I still immediately downloaded ClassicShell and installed it. The new 8.1 UI just doesn't cut it for me. I need my Computer (My PC) icon often for the first few weeks of any PC as I personalize the various setting beyond what's available in the Control Panel. Secondly, the battery life is only so-so--seems like 6-8 hours. Not quite tablet territory but it's good enough for the business user for the day without carrying the charger brick around and that's sufficient.Now, what's good:1. It's only slightly heavier than my Samsung Tab 2 10.1 and it's full-function Windows!2. Start up from scratch is within 15 seconds. Wake up from sleep is as fast as any tablet.3. The new keyboard is ingenious. The rigidity is good enough and the key placements are intuitive. I have been using a Lenovo Yoga 2 for a year now and I still hit the wrong keys all the time. Not with this keyboard that I'm using now. The slight fold to give it a tilt is amazingly simple and effective. It does make touching the bottom icons a bit awkward but, hey, there is a good touch pad! My only gripe is the two-key function keys but I got used to it fast and we do have to realize it's a compact design. Touch type is totally acceptable, better than any detachable keyboard I've ever used. Pricey and extra but great design.4. Smooth screen scrolling. The first Surface touch screen was not the best (never bothered with Surface 2) and this one is smooth and sensitive.5. The pen is easy to use. The first time you use the pen it gives you a 15-second tutorial on how to use the buttons. It uses a cloth holder with a glue tape that you attach to the cover. It seems to hold it well but the longevity remains to be seen. Downside is that if you detach the keyboard then you have to make sure you put the pen in your pocket. It seems a bit silly because when you don't have the keyboard is when you need the pen the most. However, this is insufficient as a flaw to knock off a star.6. I save the best for the last: the display. I'm outside in the backyard typing this. It's sunny and I can see the screen with shades on. The display is fine and bright; 1440, I think. This beats most ultra books out there for sure. If you're like me who use multiple windows open side by side, the aspect ratio and the fine display make it feasible on such a small unit.I fly weekly to go to work. This baby will surely go with me. Since it's a tablet, and Canadian airlines now allow digital units (but not notebook computers) to be used at all time with airplane mode, I can use this uninterrupted throughout the flight without having to compromise full Windows functionality.Highly recommended for those who don't mind the slightly higher price and would appreciate a full-function and compact PC that can double as an occasional tablet.","rating":5},{"comment":"Was looking at the MacBook Pro Retina 13\" since MacBook Air resolution is too low but it would require the additional purchase of iPad Air, Adonit Jot stylus and Intuos digitizer pad to be somewhat equivalent but less integrated than Surface Pro 3.After owning the Surface 3 i5\/8GB\/256GB for several days now I love the sharp usable 12\" display, precision pen for note taking\/annotating\/signing PDF documents to promote a green paperless environment, the ability to detach the keyboard so it doesn't stick in my throat when lying on the sofa reading with it on my chest, the excellent sound quality from dual front facing speakers and at a featherweight 1.76 pounds without keyboard cover which feels about the same as my iPad.  Another added health benefit is it barely outputs any heat and the heat isn't directed at your private area when used on the lap like the MacBooks.While the keyboard is fine for fast touch typing the touchpad is a little smaller for comfort so I'd recommend a Bluetooth or USB external mouse.","rating":5},{"comment":"I've played with both the RT and Surface Pro Microsoft Tablets.  This new version 3 with the 256gb sd drive is blazingly fast at boot. 12 seconds or less.  I am thinking about buying one for myself  BUT I will wait to see how it holds up over time with the almost daily Windows updates.  My two I7 256 GB SD drive  laptops with16 GB and 8 GB loaded with Windows 7 have both gone from 7  to 12 second boot times to over 2-3 minutes.  Why?  One machine is 3 years old and the other a year old.  Both were upgraded last year and were blazingly fast.  Now with all the updates they have become noticeably slower. Any one of my three loaded browsers, I Explorer, Chrome or Fire Fox has drastically slowed down.  No virus or malware problems.All I know is every time a new Windows update comes out and they go through the update process they get slower?  Both Laptops cost less than 1\/3rd of what this Tablet costs.  I used to brag and go OOOOOH over their start-up times ....now I just wait.  My older ASUS netbook had to be updated from XP to Windows 7.  It spends at least 20 minutes a day booting up and updating du to all the Windows updates.  It's almost useless.  It sounds to me as if Microsoft has decided to put out software and hardware that is designed to be useless after 2 or 3 years forcing you to buy another of their products.  $5,000 for a PC that will only be good for 2 years tops...few businesses or individuals can afford that luxury.  Also the time it takes for cope with the daily updates and maintenance tasks make it a questionable expenditure at best.","rating":3},{"comment":"I looked at various machines for my new work computer - ultrabooks, convertibles, 2-in-1's, and all the rest. There wasn't anything quite like the Surface Pro 3 on the market that I could find. I was a little hesitant, having never seen a Surface, let alone played around with one, but I read many reviews and decided to take the plunge. I'm glad I did.First of all, the specs are nice - the 1440p resolution, the 256GB SSD, wireless AC connectivity. It feels like a high end machine. It boots quickly and quietly. I've only heard the fan turn on once during a system update, but not when watching videos or doing anything that would turn the fan on in my old ultrabook.Second, there doesn't seem to be anything quite like this out there at the moment. The ability the magnetically connect and disconnect the keyboard cover is nice. The stylus\/pen to draw or write notes with is nice, too. And it's nice to have a tablet and an ultrabook at your disposal in a single device, depending on your mood and your needs.The hardware feels solidly built. I am particularly impressed with the keyboard cover. I was afraid that a board so thin would create typing issues. Nonsense. The keys have a solid feel to them, and I find this keyboard superior to a few others I've tried on ultrabooks. The kickstand in this version is rugged and versatile. You can angle the screen almost any way you like. It works well on a table, on a lap (where I'm typing this review) or on a couch. I didn't play around with the older Surfaces, but I can imagine the kickstand on the Pro 3 is a major upgrade.My only minor complaints are as follows: the trackpad isn't my favorite when trying to right-click. It often left-clicks instead. It's easy enough to move the cursor where you want to go, although it can get tricky with such high DPI, but I wish it was easier to differentiate between right and left clicks. Also, while the pen\/stylus itself is nice, Microsoft decided to give you a stick-on pen holder to attach by adhesive to your preferred location on the keyboard cover. Not sure why the pen holder wasn't attached at the warehouse by more secure means. We'll see how well the adhesive holds up over time.Many seem to complain that the Surface Pro 3 (and its predecessors) doesn't come with a keyboard cover. Yes, it ain't cheap to add one to your already expensive purchase. I get that. I'm not as upset about it as others seem to be, but there is no doubt that the keyboard cover is an essential item to have.Another major complaint, though not specific to the Surface, is Windows 8 (or 8.1). I know many Luddites who refuse to budge from Windows 7 (a fine OS, but getting more obsolete every day), and even a couple XP users (c'mon guys!). While I've had my share of frustrations with Windows 8 trying to figure out how to do something simple that was done a certain way in all previous Windows versions, I've found that once you figure a few things out, Windows 8 is a, dare I say, elegant OS. It's obviously more attuned to modern functionality, like SSD optimization and networking. Once you figure out what they are going for, you get to appreciate it. That is especially true on a tablet\/hybrid device like the Surface.Overall, I haven't even tapped into many of the features of the Surface Pro 3 yet, but I'm already happy with my purchase. I'm glad I decided to deviate a little from the norm. These types of devices should be on the rise in the future as people get to understand what they can do.","rating":4},{"comment":"Recently purchased and set up the table.  Bought it to replace a previous 13&#34; table.  Excellent design and best of both worlds.  Have been waiting for a 12&#34; tablet that is light and has removable keyboard.  This one seems to fit the requirements.  Also was attracted to the light weight.  My other table although it had a removable keyboard became a little uncomfortable to travel with through airports etc.  If you are looking for a laptop replacement with tablet features, this just might be your answer.","rating":5},{"comment":"I am a frequent traveller.

I only have one thing that i didn't like is that it has froze up twice and I cant understand why.","rating":4},{"comment":"I stepped up to the pro 3 from the 2. 8gb ram 256ssd. The only thing that disappointed me a bit was that some games than ran pretty well on steam were laggy on the 3. I suspect it's because of the increased resolution, but I don't know for certain. I didn't really get it for gaming as I have a ginormous Asus notebook for that. Still would have been nice. Regarding the other things i'm very happy. It does fit quite well on an airplane tray table with the keyboard clicked in to the bezel and the kickstand opened minimally. In tablet mode with keyboard detached its great. Like the pro2 you can fold the keyboard underneath to allow the tablet to sit up if you have a small space to prop it up. the mouse is VASTLY improved and actually functional. It does actually have a left and right click button underneath the trackpad or you can do a two finger tap for right clicks. Scrolling isn't bad at all with two fingers, but I like touching the screen for that anyhow. the pen is great, inks really well. the buttoncell batteries for the pen are pre-installed into the top quarter of the pen so you only need install the AAAA battery. There are instructions on the Microsoft website for changing out the button cells, but I imagine they last a very long time. the unit feels very light (for its size mind you). I'll update later as I use it more.The keyboard is a bit cramped, but I agree with the professional tech reviewers, it's not the best for extensive typing. fair bit of flex as well. kickstand is wonderful makes it so easy to put the device at any angle. The inking is quite good, best I've seen as far as handwriting goes. I know it's not the best tablet, but it is a hybrid after all. I like being able to review my emails in outlook while using the unit as a tablet and being able to read or watch movies or play some games. It's just so flexible in what you can do.It will never replace my laptop (not for me) but my laptop is very powerful and VERY heavy. Aside from games or heavy video\/photo editing it meets most of my computing needs quite well. design and build quality is very good.Everyone should also know that there are two version of internet explorer, the tablet version that is finger friendly and the desktop version (needed for certain applets, java, etc.).You can go to the Microsoft website and download the user's manual to really get a better idea of what to expect as far as functionality goes. I like it better than using a MacBook air (I have a powerbook so I know of the quality of apple computers). I like being able to use my finger to scroll webpages, nothing beats it. Still you need a mouse for some website menus to work properly if that site is not optimized for tablets (and many are not).If you want the best tablet software, don't look here! Maybe someday, but nothing outstanding. I think IT professionals will find this unit very attractive.Also be aware, some fonts in windows or other programs are so tiny you need a freakin magnifying glass to see them and that is a bit annoying, but it's not that much stuff that's like that.YES too big and heavy to hold in one hand unless you are a bodybuilder or linebacker. It's great on the couch though where you can rest it on your lap in tablet mode.It feels less like an oversized Hershey bar (i'm looking at you surface pro 2) and more like an elegant piece of technology. IF you want a product with incredible flexibility in user interface\/portability and the ability to run true desktop programs (not crappy tablet equivalents) then this is the unit for you. Not that iPads don't have kick-ass software, they do but they will always be limited to what a tablet can do. Does this have garageband? N0 but I can run cakewalk on it and use my midi interface! Who cares about garage band when you can do that!Perfect? No.Excellent quality? Yes.Incredible Flexibility? Yes.Lightweight? Yes (by ultrabook standards)Keyboard appropriate for writing the great American novel? No. Honestly, I wouldn't mind a slightly heavier\/bulkier one with better key travel.Hope this review helps someone!update: For a pretty good analysis of the entire system you should check out the anandtech article. It seems like a well balanced analysis [...]After using the unit for about 5 days now I can say that I am still very pleased. Regarding microsoft's claim that the fan isn't even noticeable i'd have to say um, okay NO. during web browsing, no problem. Play \"minion run\" from the app store in tablet mode and the fan is quickly producing Category 2 winds from the right side of the unit and the top right corner can melt cheese. Now minion run is pretty graphically intensive, true, and it does run very smoothly, but it's a load on the machine. If you read the anandtech article you'll see some possible reasons why it has more of a gaming problem (including display resolution of course).Wifi connection has been quite good, no problems noted. (UPDATE! SEE BELOW)if using the unit in bed the positioning experience is far better than any tablet I've ever owned.Outlook is MUCH easier to use and far less cramped than on the pro2, in fact all the office apps feel better and more like a desktop experience.When the keyboard is magnetically hinged to the bezel it is harder to touch items on the taskbar in desktop mode and you may find yourself needing to you use the mouse to activate them.Volume rocker is a bit stiffer than I would like, but once you activate it you can use the onscreen slider on the left hand side to make large volume changes more easily.Update: as of 7\/8\/2014 MANY people, including myself, are having wifi disconnect issues when the unit wakes from sleep mode and is NOT connected to a power source. It's a bit of a pain in the butt because you have to keep opening the charms bar and disconnecting and reconnecting the network. Microsoft is apparently well aware of this problem and allegedly there is a fix in the works for this month. Still a bit disappointing on a device this high tech and this pricey.","rating":4},{"comment":"I felt the need to post my review here to offset some of the one star reviews that just left me dumbfounded...I didn't buy my Surface Pro 3 from Amazon, rather I bought it from Best Buy, because I wanted to deal locally in case something went wrong, since I heard that initial models had power issues, and it actually worked to my advantage.  I had initially bought the 4GB model, because I wanted to replace my ASUS TF300T that was...terrible... and thought I would only use it as tablet.  I found that I really wanted to use this as a tablet-laptop hybrid and started installing all of my desktop software such as Spotify, Dropbox, Tresorit, Steam, etc.  I found that 4GB really was not enough for a huge laptop-like experience, since the Windows 8.1 OS itself took around 1.5 - 2GB of memory.  So I was able to exchange it in for this model.My experience with the 4GB model was near flawless.  The only issue I had was that the Surface Pen seemed to not pair properly.  The Surface Pen has two battery types powering it.  The AAAA battery that you have to insert yourself powers the pen being usable as a pointing\/clicking device, while two small coin batteries inserted in the top of the pen power the blutooth pairing and the One Note specific features.  After reading online, I found that buyers had a pretty good chance of the coin batteries not working properly.  In my case, clicking the top would not always take me to One Note, and it would not display as &#34;Paired&#34; in the PC Settings.My experience with the 8GB model was a little more rocky.  I first got it, and sometimes it would hiccup at first.  I later found out this was because I had forgot to do updates, and Windows was automatically installing them.  One of these updates was a firmware update that included an update to the Type Cover firmware.  I spent around 30 minutes troubleshooting why my Type Cover wasn't working, only to realize a firmware update, which required a restart to restore functionality (the restart notification failed to pop up as well) was installed under my nose.  This was annoying, but easily fixed by me selecting to install updates manually, so that I am aware of what is happening.  Once I restarted the Surface to apply the updates, it froze on me after loading the OS.  Since then however, it has been smooth sailing *knock on wood*The main pros of the Surface Pro are that, first and foremost, it has an Intel processor and an SSD.  I have learned never to trust Tegra or any other type of processor, because they are simply incapable of doing heavy lifting, and in some cases lag even when watching videos.  The SSD is also very nice.  There is also plenty of screen real estate for a mobile device.The main drawbacks of the Surface Pro for me is the text size.  I had to increase the Windows Fonts to their max level, otherwise I could not tap tabs in Chrome or easily read text without being close to the screen.  Compared to other tablets of similar size, I would say that the default text in desktop applications is 50% smaller.  Even after increasing the size, there are some rather small text displays, and Icons can sometimes be annoying to tap.  Another drawback is when using the type cover, there is a magnetic strip that can attach the cover to the bottom section of the tablet.  This makes tapping icons on the task bar annoyingly difficult sometimes, since you cannot tap it in such a way as you're used to.  Since I use the type cover solely for typing and always use the touch screen instead of the trackpad, this is extra annoying for me.  The silver-lining is that I have grown accustomed to using the home screen to bring up apps, or swiping from the left to bring up a minimized app.All in all a very nice to have.  Is it worth the money?  That depends on what it is being purchased for.  For me, since I am  a nerdy Software Engineer, it is like jewelry to me, but for what it is definitely worth the money.  It is the most powerful tablet on the market (I believe) and matches the Macbooks in terms of specs.  So you are getting a very high end form factor tablet and a decently high end laptop in one unit.  That is definitely worth the cost in my book if that is what you need\/desire.","rating":4},{"comment":"Mpow Streambot Y FM transmitter allows you to transmit sound from your mobile devices to your car stereo if it does not have a built-in bluetooth. To start the transmission you need to find a vacant station on your FM dial and then tune both the car the Mpow transmitter to that station. To find vacant FM stations in my area I used a web site \"radio-locator (dot) com\/cgi-bin\/vacant\" where you can enter your zip code and get a list of stations to try. This web site ranks vacant stations as \"best\", \"great\" and \"good\". Their suggestion worked well for me, the first station I tried gave me a clear reception.To change what station is tuned on the transmitter you need to rotate the ring on the transmitter. The bluetooth operated smoothly and connected to my iPad Mini without any problems. You can see this transmitter in action in attached video.Mpow FM transmitter has a USB port. This port can be used for a pass through charging. Since the Mpow transmitter is using the car outlet pass port allows me to run another device from the same car port, for example, to power a GPS without a splitter.Overall I am very pleased. This transmitter has not lost the transmission when I drive even over some bumpy road.This FM transmitter is provided by Mpow.Ali Julia review","rating":4},{"comment":"The Mpow Streamnot Y Wireless Bluetooth FM Transmitter Radio Adapter is uniquely designed with its bright lights many functions.  We have a 1990 Chrysler LeBaron Convertible that has the original radio and I really don't want to upgrade it because it will alter it's original appearance. The Mpow FM transmitter easily paired with my iPhone 5S (no code needed).  It's nice that changing the frequency of the adapter can be changed by single digits instead of jumping by double digits.All the controls are easily accessible as you can see in the video.  The built-in USB port is nice to have to charge your phone or other accessories.  When answering calls, the music pauses and you just need to touch the multipurpose button on the top to answer the call.  I can hear the caller clearly through my car speakers.  However, the caller on the other side most of the time has issues hearing me since the mic is located on the adapter and it is plugged in quite a distance away from me.  Anyways I am more interested in using the Mpow FM Transmitter for listening to my iTunes music library instead of calls.Overall this is a great gadget for music, but an okay device for making or receiving calls.Sample for provided for review","rating":4},{"comment":"There are several methods to wirelessly stream music to your vehicle, one method is transmitting through FM radio frequencies, which is when the Mpow Streambot Y comes in handy.&#9654; Package Contents&#8226; Mpow Streambot Y Wireless Bluetooth FM Transmitter Radio Adapter&#8226; Instruction Manual&#8226; Return and exchanges card&#9654; Specifications&#8226; Bluetooth specification: V2.1EDR&#8226; Bluetooth profiles: HSP, HFP, A2DP, and AVRCP&#8226; FM Frequency Range: 88.1 ~ 107.9 MHz&#8226; Bluetooth Operating Distance: 30 feet&#8226; FM Operating distance: 15 feet&#8226; USB Output: 5V\/1A&#9654; HardwareThis device consists of two parts: the receiver and power adapter. Altogether the device is 6.5&#8221; x 5.2&#8221; x 1.3&#8221; inches; 6.4 ounces, which is fairly small for any device. Alone the receiver is 2.9&#8221; x 1&#8221; inches, and power adapter is 3.75&#8221; x 5&#8221;. The power adapter directly plugs into the cigarette socket, which is a great feature, considering most FM transmitters require batteries. At the top is a 5V\/1A USB port, which is made specifically for phones and smaller USB devices. For larger devices, you are wanting a 2A USB port (or higher).The power adapter connects to a rubber flexible gooseneck pipe and a magnetic connection port which goes into the receiver. The receiver consists of the frequency control knob, next\/previous buttons, a display screen, volume knob, and multi-functional button. Overall, the device is well constructed.The device uses the FM frequency from 88.1 ~ 107.9, which is basically the entirety of the FM band. This is one method to wirelessly connect to your device without wires. The other method would be attaching a Bluetooth receiver to the Auxiliary port (3.5mm female stereo port) of your vehicle (if you have one). Now, this is where you will get the debate of which method is better, which overall depends on the user&#8217;s location (see disclaimer in testing section). There are Pros and Cons to each device, as both methods may see some interference.&#9654; Set up1. Plug the transmitter into the car cigarette socket.2. Press the multi-function button about 2 seconds until the blue indicator light flashes.3. Turn on the Bluetooth function on your phone (tablet, or media player).4. Search for Bluetooth devices and select &#8220;MPOW&#8221;.5. If pairing is successful, the blue indicator light will always be on.6. Tune the car FM radio frequency to the unused FM station.7. Tune the FM transmitter into the same frequency with the car FM radio.8. Now you can enjoy your music through the car stereo.The setup process is extremely easy, but if you purchase MPOW products, then you will notice that every MPow product uses &#8220;MPOW&#8221; as their Bluetooth name. This will lead to major confusion if you decide to purchase more than one product.&#9654; TestingI will start by stating a little disclaimer. Because this uses FM frequencies, the experience will be different for everyone. More populated areas will result in more radio stations, which means the experience won&#8217;t be as positive as someone who lives in a rural or less populated area.The initial setup of the device was a little frustrating, because, despite the power adapter using a magnetic connection into the receiver, the receiver didn&#8217;t want to turn on. I was required to turn the receiver until it came on. Also, the position of the receiver always seemed awkward, as I was required to move the receiver to the right, potentially blocking the other cigarette lighter. I would have preferred the display and buttons optimized for the driver instead.The lights and display of the device are impressively flashy. It is almost like having a secondary display for your stereo. As said in setup, the device is fairly easy to setup, but may be a little frustrating with MPow deciding to name every Bluetooth device &#8220;MPOW&#8221;. For me, I used 101.3 FM as the radio station, which had very little static, and seemed to perform better in terms of volume and sound quality than my Himbox HB01, which also is in the same price range. I was overall very impressed by this product.&#9654; Final ThoughtsI think the cons for this device are minor. Purchasing this device means you know the potential  risks. This device is ideal for vehicles without an auxiliary port and requires almost no setup (beside Bluetooth pairing). My experience with this device was very positive, because the sound quality was superior to my Himbox HB01. I absolutely recommend this device to anyone needing such a device and give this product a 5 star rating.Pros:+ Uses FM connection, which means everyone&#8217;s experience will be different. My experience was extremely positive.+ Absolutely no wires required, unlike similar car kits that require auxiliary input.+ Impressively flashy interface.+ Doesn&#8217;t require batteries and includes a USB port.+ Same cost as Bluetooth adapter with auxiliary port.Cons:- Uses FM connection, which means everyone&#8217;s experience will be different.- Despite using magnetic connection, I was required to turn receiver in order for it to turn on.- Every MPow product uses the name &#8220;MPOW&#8221; for Bluetooth, which will lead to confusion if you purchase multiple MPow products.- Display and buttons are optimized for the passenger instead of the driver. Because of this issue, it also potentially blocks cigarette outlets on the right side (see testing, 2nd paragraph).I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.","rating":5},{"comment":"*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for Mpow and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*(Please be sure to read update from 7\/20\/2014 below)Not my the first FM transmitter, nor the first with Bluetooth connectivity.  The Mpow Streambot is one of many in this category of products, including the nearly identicalExcelvan F33For my review, I'll be mostly comparing it against theSatechi Soundfly View.  Admittedly, the Satechi is more expensive, but I'll be sticking to the shared features between the two.One thing is for sure, the Streambot is very easy to use.  The controls are straight forward, as is the method for pairing it up with your devices.  Perhaps I've missed this in other similar devices, but the Streambot and its twin are the only two I've seen where anti-theft is taken into account.  With other FM transmitters, you pretty much have to take the whole thing out of the 12V socket and stash it somewhere out of sight.  If you have a charging cable attached to it, that has to be handled too.  My Satechi is guilty of this too, doubly so as it also has the option for AUX out and in.  On the Streambot however, the whole upper control cylinder pops off, leaving the rest in place.  About the size of a lipstick, the cylinder is easy to put into your pocket or hide elsewhere.  Out of sight, out of mind.The materials and build quality of the Streambot are respectable.  Nothing fabulous, but not something to raise an eyebrow of concern over.  The LED in these is a bit too dim to see in full daylight, and while the arm does articulate, it has its limitations.  The charging power is nice and snug, as is the connection for your vehicle's 12V port.In operation, the Mpow was pretty mediocre.  My usage time was one month, to ensure I had a feel for the product.  Compared to the Satechi, the Mpow's FM transmitter is quite a bit weaker.  Where the Satechi could pump tunes on almost every frequency, used or not, the Streambot had difficulty with weak and some dead frequencies.  This wasn't a huge surprise, as most every other FM transmitter I've used\/reviewed loses to the Satechi.  Alas, the last one I had was stolen, so I can't compare directly.  Adding the pain, the output from the Streambot to my car's radio is substantially lower than that of the Satechi, my car's AUX port, and my best recollection of other models.  For my testing, I ensured the Mpow and phone were both one step down from max volume.  Using a decibel meter and a sound sample, I was able to compared the volume at different radio volumes and frequencies.  The results for FM only showed that the Mpow trailed the Satechi by 17-30db, depending on the frequency.  The results from my car's AUX jack showed a 25-30db difference.  That was good to know, as I thought I was going deaf at first.  Making calls was no problem other than not being able to get the volume up as high as I would have liked.  Also, while driving around, the Mpow died on my three times, for no apparent reason.  Getting it working again was a matter of pulling the base from the 12V socket and putting it back in.At the end of the day, my thought it that the Mpow Streambot isn't a horrible device, but it's quieter than I would like and at least tad sketchy.Update 7\/20\/2014:  As you may have noticed, Mpow contacted me concerning the issues I had with the test unit they had sent out.  A second unit was sent out at my suggestion, to determine if the original was defective in some way.  Another week of daily use testing commenced.  The end results are as follows.  The transmission strength remained the same, but the sound level improved drastically.  Also, over the time period, the unit did not die off like the original.  Doing some mix and match play, I was able to work out that the control module of the original unit was the cause of both issues.  I've updated my rating from 3 stars to 4, due to the operation of a good unit.  I chose not to go with 5 as it would appear, based on my experience as well as that of some of other reviewers, that there are some quality\/testing problems at the factory which allowed defective\/partially defective units to be shipped to customers.","rating":4},{"comment":"Setup of the device is very simple and almost effortless. First, find the cigarette outlet that will best suite you from the driver's seat. Insert the goose neck base, and then set the control portion on top of the magnetized base.The Bluetooth adapter will automatically go into paring mode, just run a scan on your phone. Turn the radio to an unused FM station, this will allow the transmitter to play your music on your radio. Lastly, match the same station on the transmitter. Now you will be able to enjoy your music and place phone calls over your car speakers without any wires or buying a new car radio.The audio and call quality is better than I expected from such a small device. Since the neck is flexible, it can be positioned just about any direction, which is great. There is even a USB port to charge your mobile devices.The best part is being able to safely place a call without having to take your eyes off the road.I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a pretty neat Bluetooth FM transmitter that can come in handy for music listening purposes in your car. Here are some of my observations.Pros:1. It is very easy to pair up. It took me just a few seconds to put it in the pairing mode, and then it was immediately recognized by my iPhone 4S. After that the connection was fairly robust and consistent - I never had to &#34;re-pair&#34; it again.2. The range seems pretty good. Obviously, you are primarily going to use this device from within the car, so this feature should not in general be much of an issue. Nonetheless, I tried beaming music to the car from some distance (about 20 - 30 feet), and it still worked without a hitch.3. The sound quality was pretty good. Almost as good as having a direct connection between my iPhone and my car's audio system.4. The transmitter is not too large and it doesn't clutter up my car. It really helps with keeping the mess in my car to a minimum.Cons:1. It takes a while for the transmitter to be turned on\/off. I have to press and hold the on\/off button for a few seconds in order to accomplish this.Overall, this is a pretty neat gadget that will really help get your smartphone music to the car music system on an older car without Bluetooth connectivity.**** Product provided for review purposes. ****","rating":4},{"comment":"The Streambot Bluetooth FM transmitter works quite well as a speaker phone for the car. The set up is pretty straight forward. All we need is to plug the unit in the 12V cigarette lighter socket, sync it with your phone's Bluetooth, and tune it to an unused FM station.What I like about this product is that it draws the power from the car's 12V socket without having to worry about running out of power. The flexible shaft also allows me to position the control in a convenient way. The sound quality of the unit is also pretty good for phone conversations.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is one of the easiest devices to configure and set-up that I have ever come across.  The set-up was a snap.  The connection was flawless and the Mpow Streambot Y FM transmitter is very easy to use.My automobile is older and does not have Bluetooth capability built into the radio system.  The Mpow allows me to connect my iPhone to the automobile stereo system and the music is simply beautiful.  The sound quality is excellent.  This will work with your iPhone or iPad, MP3 or many other smart phone devices.If for any reason you want\/need to switch phones\/devices, that is very easy to do.You can use the Mpow as a hands free phone.  The sound quality on the calls you receive using the Mpow, is excellent.  However since the mic will generally be a little further away than ideal, the quality\/volume of your voice might be less than ideal.There is a USB charging port that you can use to charge other devices even when you are streaming music through the device.The design is very smart and sleek.  It has a flexible gooseneck to you can position it in different configurations.  The controls are well located and very easy to use.I love the Mpow Streambot Y.  It works like a charm, produces very high quality music through the car's stereo system.  It has worked flawlessly every time I use it.Highly recommended.I was provided a sample product for testing\/review purposes.","rating":5},{"comment":"I received my transmitted as a review sample from the manufacturer. I've owned four similar devices over the past five years, but this one is the slickest in looks and the easiest to install and use of them all. For one thing, the bluetooth part of this transmitter makes itself know as soon as you turn it on for the first time. You do not need to press any buttons or hold them down - just do a scan from your phone's bluetooth settings menu and 'mpow' shows up. Pair and connect, then find a free channel on you FM radio and match that channel with the FM transmitter on this device and you are set. Simple, fast and hassle free.What I love is the on-off button. In some older cars - particularly Porches - the lighter socket is always active. Some of the transmitters on the market do not have an on-off button and will drain your battery unless you remove it when you shut down your engine. So, for newer vehicles this may not seem important, but for older ones it's a major feature.The design is clever. The head attaches to the gooseneck via a magnetic connection that holds in place. The entire unit is compact.  However, the physical characteristics are not as important as the sound quality and here is where this one excels. Each incoming or outgoing call that I received or made with my Galaxy Note 3 phone was crystal clear on both ends. More importantly, when I am streaming music (a constant when I am driving) the device did not pick up any ignition interference. A few of my other transmitters would do that and it drove me nuts. This one seems to have zero EMI and RFI issues, for which I am grateful.Bottom line: if you have an older vehicle that is not bluetooth enabled, this is a quick and relatively inexpensive way to give it hand's free capability as well as the ability to stream music to your FM radio. As of the date of this review this particular model is the best one that I have owned and the one I sincerely recommend to friends.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have a 3.5mm auxillary jack in my car, but it is not always convenient to have a cable plugged into my phone. The Streambot Y bluetooth device solves this issue by providing a bluetooth connection between your phone and the car's audio system.Packaging: the Streambot Y came in a nice box with plenty of molded foam padding inside. Packaging was very easy to open and the product was nicely protected. Definitely a big step up from the hard plastic packaging found in most inexpensive electronics.Size: The device does stick out from the 12V outlet a bit, but on the upside, the FM transmitter part is attached to a flexible arm, so you can position it in the most convenient way. The lower (charger) portion contains a USB port for fast charging and is similar in size to most USB car chargers.Functionality:-The built-in charging functionality is great, because it means you are able to charge your phone while you stream. The charger was able to detect my phone and charge in fast (AC) mode.-The transmitter has a convenient volume knob, instead of buttons. I much prefer the volume knob, since it is much easier and faster to change volume compared to buttons.-There is a LCD display on the transmitter which displays the current station setting. This makes it easy to match the FM station on your car's stereo system to the proper station being transmitted from the device.-There are back\/forward buttons on the transmitter so that you can skip tracks without using the touchscreen on your phone. Again, a very convenient touch.Ease of use:The Streambot Y came with an instruction sheet, but to be honest, the device is so easy to use that I never needed to use the instructions. All you need to do is plug it into the car's 12V outlet (while the outlet is powered on), and &#34;MPOW&#34; will appear in your phone's list of bluetooth devices. Simply pair via bluetooth, select a radio station on the device, select the matching radio station on your car's stereo, and you are good to go!Sound quality:This is one of the most important aspects of any car audio accessory, and I have been disappointed by the poor audio quality of FM transmitters in the past. However, I'm pleased to say that the Streambot Y has very good audio quality; it is almost as good as what you'd get through a 3.5mm auxillary jack, and certainly every bit as good as what FM radio stations normally sound like. I've experienced very little interference issues when using this transmitter. On the few times when I did get some interference, I was driving through a place where normal FM stations would also suffer from interference. So not really a fault of the device.Overall, I think this is a great device and I'm pleased with it so far.","rating":5},{"comment":"I do not pretend to understand just how this amazing little transmitter works &#8211; but it does work beautifully.  It's easy to set up.  Tune it to an unused fm frequency and power it up through the auxiliary port on your radio or directly through the lighter plug.  I&#8217;ve tried it both ways; either way, the sound is simply wonderful.  In fact, I prefer the sound when the transmitter is connected to the auxiliary power rather than directly to the radio.You can use this device to talk hands-free on your phone.  You can use it to connect to any bluetooth-enabled device. You can even use it to charge your phone or player while streaming audio.If you spend a lot of time in your car, if you enjoy quality sound in your car, if you listen to audio books or your favorite music, then this transmitter is a must.  I&#8217;m really amazed and will continue to use it happily when I travel.FIVE STARS and then some!","rating":5},{"comment":"Great product that saved me hundreds of dollars.

After the initial charging (21.5 hours) I plugged it in to my car stereo and paired it to my android phone. Works beautifully! AND it was $30 less than the JVC doggle from the stereo manufacturer. My only complaint is that my voice on phone calls is too weak, but a bit of tweaking on my part will in all likelihood fix that. Music and pod casts from my phone to the car stereo sounds great.","rating":4},{"comment":"The first unit had a defective battery and would only work plugged in. The replacement worked for a week and then would not accept a charge or work plugged in. The bottom line is that there are serious quality control issues with this product.

In that past week and a half I have used this device in many different ways.1. This has been my go to device to stream music and have a aftermarket hands free device in my car. I works very well in this aspect. Since this device is really small, super light, and the metal audio adapter allow it to mount directly to my head unit. It fits perfectly, and is a minimal eye soar. The device pics up my voice with no problem, and streams my music\/calls pefectly.2. I have also used this as a wireless headphone device. I had a really long day out on the train\/public transportation, and towards the end of the day my phone was dying. I was able to put my phone in my bad and allow it to charge off of my battery pack.3. Finally I have brought this in the house and streamed my music through my home stereo, and it performed just as well as it did in the car! The range is not huge, but for the size of the device, and the low power that it runs off of, I think the range is absolutely acceptable.The battery has to be tiny on this thing! It is so small, and I have yet to run it flat. I charge it regularly in the car where it is always attached to power, but I have had it running for a full 7 hour stint of yard work last weekend, and it rocked through all of it!","rating":5},{"comment":"Works exactly as advertised.  I've used it in the car, in the yard with a portable radio with aux in, while mowing the lawn (no more flinging my phone from my shirt pocket when my hand catches a cord!) and at my desk at work with powered speakers (I could plug directly but this gives me a wireless, clean desk).I've gone 9 hours play time without needing to recharge but haven't let it die completely to test the limits.","rating":5},{"comment":"The fact that I have to turn in on every time effectively kills it for me. I knew that going in and I thought that wouldn't matter but it does since it's quite inconvenient  especially if your car does have bluetooth (and just doesn't have bluetooth streaming). It's dirt-cheap, yeah but you are not going to use it.","rating":2},{"comment":"Great fidelity.  Some issues I didn't expect (reason for 4 stars) but I'm keeping it.My 2011 Nissan has no A2DP Bluetooth stereo audio.  Nissan only provided cellphone Bluetooth.  So I needed a unit that could send transmitted stereo signal from my cellphone to a receiver that would distribute the music or audio stream to the &#34;aux&#34; input within my car.  This unit does that well with great fidelity.  However...I do NOT like the fact that I have to dig down into the center console each and every time I want to re-pair my phone with the unit.  Unlike built-in car manufacturer supplied A2DP stereo Bluetooth, which repairs automatically every time you start your car, this unit does not do it automatically.Why didn't I get BT audio installed when I bought the car new?  Nissan wanted THOUSANDS more for the navigation system I didn't need to which they tied the A2DP feature.  They would not provide A2DP unless I paid nearly $500.00 for it as an after-market item. So you have your choice...buy this with a slight loss of pairing convenience,or spend $500 on a car dealers profit.For a unit obviously mass manufactured in China, I am astonished at the frequency response (really flat as BT units go) and overall fidelity of vocals and instrumentation.Another thing....this unit also provides cellphone Bluetooth in addition to A2DP media Bluetooth.  And the microphone is on the small body of the unit. So whomever you call or calls you will not be able to hear you well if your aux jack is in the center console.  Too bad it doesn't pick up your voice from the cellphone's condenser microphone.","rating":4},{"comment":"In the box -- The receiver- a 48&#34; 3.5mm male to male audio cable- a 32&#34; micro USB charging cable- a short metal male to male 3.5mm adapterI used this device to make my alarm clock that accepts an AUX input wireless. I did this by simply plugging in the adapter to the streambot mini, and then I plugged the other end into the AUX port on my stereo alarm clock. I used the multifunction button to turn on the Streambot mini, and right away it showed up in the devices section in my phone's Bluetooth settings. It showed up as &#34;MPOW&#34;, and then I connected with it right away, no problem. I then closed the Bluetooth settings and opened up the music player. First I set my alarm clock to play through the AUX port, and then I started playing a song. Right away music started playing, loud and clear. You can change the volume, pause, play, or skip tracks all from the receiver, or if you prefer you can just do it from your device that you are using to play the music. One thing I did notice though - there is about a 2 second delay while using this device. This isn't a big deal for listening to music, but if you try to watch a movie and have the audio playing through this receiver, the delay will drive you insane. However, this isn't a big enough deal to drop a star, I just wouldn't use this receiver to watch movies.Note: I was provided this product for free to review and test, but that doesn't affect my review or opinion in any way.","rating":5},{"comment":"This review is after the initial test.By the current rating you can tell I'm not particularly impressed. I built a cooler radio and used this as the wireless bluetooth adapter. My distance inside my house on the first test is abysmal, if I place my EVO 4G LTE more than 3 feet away it loses the connection. I haven't tried it on my boat yet though and will update this comment if my opinion changes once this is tested outside. I say this because my house likely has a ton of RF interference. My house is pretty much a wireless freak zone ranging from wireless phones to dual band routers. Other likely culprits may include my Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse and wireless surround sound speakers. My walls are not wireless friendly either... That said though I have a Ion Rock Blocker wireless that get's about twenty to thirty feet of range even between walls. It does also sit pretty close to the speakers in the cooler, so another likely culprit could be the magnets are poorly shielded and thus interfering with the adapter.Once I get this out in the inter-coastal\/bay this Saturday where there's less wireless signals bouncing around I'll update the comment if things change.That said as far as sound quality when in range, it's pretty impressive. I really hope I can walk around my boat with out signal drops. If drops happen on the water it's back to the drawing board for my wireless solution.","rating":1},{"comment":"This is a tiny and very useful way to transmit music from your device to your stereo or your car stereo. Note that your car dashboard must have a 3.5mm female plug insert. The unit is only about &#8221; X 1&#8217; X 2&#8221; with an outgoing 3.5mm male plug that inserts into your system. In the case of a home stereo, you may need to buy an adapter to convert to whatever you need.The kit comes with the receiver, an audio cable, an audio adapter, a USB cable and a teensy manual. Its simple to sync your Bluetooth from your (Smartphone) up to the device and get things running. Audio can be controlled both by your Smartphone and your stereo. If a call comes in, you receive it with the music dying down and you can speak hands-free!The Bluetooth reach is a typical 30 feet (without using cables) and the lithium battery takes about 3-4 hours to charge and claims to last up to ten hours, but I found mine to peter out after 8 hours. No worries. That&#8217;s a long time to be playing music in your vehicle. You can also play, pause, fast forward or reverse your songs (manually &#8211; not hands-free).For the price, this is a very reliable and inexpensive way to transmit music via Bluetooth to you home stereo or car.

It works great and smooth.","rating":5},{"comment":"Received this monitor early Wednesday. I spent all day trying to get it to work properly.First, it took over two hours for my PC to even recognize that the PB287 as a device was connected to it via the Displayport cable included in the box. I checked and rechecked the DP connection to my monitor and to my GPUS. I tediously switched which GPU I plugged the DP into a few times (turning everything off each time) each time not succeeding.I tried many times to switch to the display through Nvidia Control panel and Windows itself before it finally recognized it AND switched over on its own.I know it might sound like I have no idea what I am talking about, but I also have a 120hz and a 1440p IPS monitors, and am quite familiar with this simple and basic procedure. There is something wrong here.When I finally got the monitor to display an image, I went into the cumbersome menu and activated DP 1.2 for 60hz 4K. I tried out a few games for about 30 minutes. Here are the positives I can say in this brief time on my SLi 780Ti PC:The image quality is astounding, and this is coming from someone who already had a 1440p IPS. I was still floored all the same. Even better, there is virtually no ghosting in fast-moving images or first person perspectives thanks to it being a TN panel instead of IPS. Motion is FAR smoother with the PB287 in comparison. Every game I tested with zero AA of any kind had smoother edges  than 1440p with 4XMSAA. Maybe even 8xMSAA. The pixel density is a beauty to behold.Also, and I have no idea why, Watch Dogs plays more smoothly at 4K than it did in 1440p. I used the same exact settings with each monitor (other than turning the Temporal SMAA off in 4k, which is very low AA setting anyways) with High Textures\/LOD, Ultra Water, etc. and not only it looks far sharper, there is FAR less stutter. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of fps drops, sometimes in the high 30s, but mostly 45-60 even in dense areas with much havok going on.Shortly after testing Watch Dogs and a few other games, the left half of my screen flickered white very fast before resuming that half of the image that was on the screen prior. From then on, in every game I tested (both using Vsync on and off in each title) I had a horizontal \"line\" going down the middle of the screen. Moving the camera around, the image would tear along this invisible line, like the left half of the monitor was out of synch with the right half by a fraction of a second.This screen-tearing is very similar to playing without Vsync, except it is horizontal instead of vertical, and it is persistent. Not a moment goes by without the tearing occurring. This is how every other moment I had playing today went for hours straight, and it isn't only during games. Closing a fullscreen tab in my browser results in the same thing: The left half is a half second delayed in revealing what is underneath it compared to the right side. The \"crease\" is exactly where the screen-tearing occurs during gaming.Resetting my PC cleared the issue for 5-10 minutes each try, but the white flicker followed by horizontal tearing comes back each time. Then my PC stopped recognizing the monitor. I rolled back from the latest Nvidia Driver to the second newest. More hours of testing without getting it to be recognized. This lasted for most of the rest of the day, me trying in vain to get it back. Finally, got it working for an hour (while tolerating the tearing) it lost connection AGAIN.Some thoughts:This is not 1ms response time. It is way better than a 1440p IPS in regards to input lag, but still no where near 1ms. I feel this being marketed in such a way is quite simply a lie.The \"line\" going right down the middle and the left side being slightly out of sync with the right side seems like something that could happen with slightly older 4K monitors that were two 30hz panels each requiring a separate HDMI cable being \"stitched together\" to comprise the monitor. But the PB287 is described in many reviews as one of the first 4k monitors with a unified panel. Surely ASUS isn't lying, but this is still weird.Major issues getting the monitor to communicate with my PC. Strange severe image issues. Probably just a bad DP cable, right? I only have the one that came in the box. I start thinking I would actually pay money to buy another one just to be done with this whole ordeal....but then I see 35 PB287 reviewers on another retailer's site where the vast majority are having connection issues and horizontal tearing just like me.Many claim to hear a loud popping sound coming from their units as well. I play with headphones on, so it is possible and maybe that happened to mine? Anyways, one of the reviewers claimed to have tried four different DP cables and none of them fixed his issues that are identical to mine. So I will not throw money at the wind trying to replace the DP cable the monitor came with.I will be contacting Amazon Customer Support after I wake up later on. I am far too tired of messing with this all day to wait in queue right now. I will be seeking a refund and not a replacement due to the number of early reports make me think it is a widespread issue at the core of the product.I will update the review and score after this gets resolved, but I cannot recommend this monitor under any condition right now.","rating":1},{"comment":"First, the good:The display quality is very good for a TN display.  It is nearly as good as my Dell 30&#34; IPS display.  The monitor can be VESA mounted and the included stand is pretty good.  It supports full UltraHD\/4k at 60hz as a single tile.Then the bad:Many people including myself have experienced issues with DP 1.2 at 60hz.  There appears to be some kind of compatibility problem which causes a poor connection between the display and the graphics card.  This issue seems to mostly affect AMD cards but there have been some reports with nvidia cards. This results in display corruption, loss of signal, strange noises, etc.  The issue can be mitigated to some extent by using a higher quality and\/or shorter displayport cable than the one included.For that reason, I would advise not purchasing this display until this issue is understood and resolved, especially if you have an AMD graphics card.

Overall a good monitor.Cons: The monitor will power cycle by itself randomly, but not very frequently, this is an apparent issue with almost every single person that has it.  The monitor also randomly does this massive flicker, it is loud and obnoxious to say the least.  It does that more often than the power cycle, but there isn't anything I can do about it.I would give it a 3.5 b\/c of the flickering and random power cycles.","rating":3},{"comment":"You can't tell this is a TN display in landscape mode.

Great price for this PPI.Cons: Portrait becomes noticeable it is a TN display with a little shadowing. Still the best portrait mode I've ever seen on a TN display. Thought about docking it a point because of this but the extra screen real estate is so high I don't really even care about portrait mode anymore.Second Monitor: Got another one and it's just as good.

When you open both the HEOS 3 & 5, you can tell immediately that Denon took the time to create a great package for their speakers. Upon opening the speaker box, you are greeted by a smaller box that contains a foam insert that cradles the power cable, an audio cable and an Ethernet cable. There is also another foam piece that contains a quick start guide. Underneath these items you will find the speaker. Seems trivial, but it does show attention to detail. The packaging is very Apple-like.Setup is a snap. The first thing you need to do is to download the HEOS app. I set mine up using iOS. Opening the app leads you through an illustrated set up procedure that guides you to adding your speaker to your network. You will use the provided audio cable to assist you in this process. You provide the password to your network and voil&agrave;, your speaker is now ready to use. (There was an update that needed to be done after I set up the speaker. It took three tries before the update took. You will not be able to group speakers until both updates are performed) I then selected a button on the bottom of the screen that allowed me to group the two speakers together. You can name them whatever you want to help you to identify them. All you need to do is drag one speaker on top of the other and they will now play together. You drag them apart if you want them to play separately.Okay, packaging and set up were good, but spending this much on speakers you expect good sound and ease of use. Let's see how the HEOS stacks up.You first have to set up a HEOS account. Under the Music tab you can select Pandora, Spotify, tunein, Rhapsody, or music from your iOS device. You can also play files from a USB drive. A big omission and disappointment here is the lack of AirPlay. I would like the ability to stream audio from any app that I'm using. Hopefully this will be added in a future update.I am not a hard core audiophile, but both the HEOS 3 & 5 pump out great sound. I found the bass on both speakers enough to rattle your windows. The larger 5 doing a little better. I have had larger wireless speakers that did not sound as good as these new offerings from DENON. There is an equalizer setting (Settings-My Devices-EQ) that you allows you to control bass and treble for each speaker. The app allows you to control each speaker volume separately or together. You can only control the volume within the app. I found this a bit annoying. There was also a slight lag after you adjusted the volume before the speakers responded.The HEOS 5 is the larger of the two speakers. I put this on top of a cabinet in my kitchen and it fills the room completely with sound. A LED on the bottom of the speaker lets you know is it on and properly connected (blue). It flashes yellow when it is connecting to the network or if there is a problem with your connection. Its smaller sibling, the HEOS 3, can be used vertically or horizontally. Make sure you select your orientation in the settings. I put this one in my living room vertically. It also has a blue light on the bottom (vertically) of the speaker.Other wireless speakers (both Bluetooth and network based) I have had would drop the connections periodically or I would need to enter the setup process all over again. The HEOS speakers have been rock solid with their connections. I have the HEOS 5 on a switch in the kitchen and it connects itself within a minute of flipping the switch.Overall, these speakers would be a great addition to anyone's home. It is cool to have your tunes in one room and go to another room and have the sound follow you! The only downside is the HEOS app. It is not quite ready for primetime and until AirPlay is added it will cost these speakers a star. Until then, I will be enjoying music from the best decade, the 80s! Shot through the heart.....","rating":4},{"comment":"Denon's entry into wireless home multi-room speakers is a force to be reckoned with. My only gripe is that it does not have blue tooth. I would love to use these speakers for our home theater and see how they stack up when watching movies. The only way to do that for now is to use the 3.5 mm cable input and connect it to your systems audio out jack. You can only play music from these speakers through the HEOS app, which tracks your habits. I hope that is a weakness they will fix in the future.My environment: 1800 square foot ranch style home with AT&T; u-verse Elite internet and their generic wireless router.SET UPThe HEOS 3 comes beautifully packaged with the power cable, 3.5 mm audio cable, ethernet cable, and quick start guide. The quick start guide is all you need, because set up is as easy as they make it sound. I downloaded the app, updated the software, and plugged the 3.5 audio cable into my iphone 4s and the speaker. The speaker connected and I labeled it on the phone.THE APPThe included app is ready to play Spotify, Pandora, Tunein, rhapsody, the music on your iphone, and local radio stations.There are three menu options: Rooms (you label each speaker on the app for a different space in your home), music (pick your music), and now playing. You can also turn music sharing on.You can easily swap between any of the speakers and adjust what they are playing along with the volume from anywhere in the house from the app.ADJUSTMENTSThe app allows you to adjust the treble & bass for each speaker. That is about all that is included.THE EXPERIENCEBoth the HEOS 3 & HEOS 5 are loud enough to fill any room in our house, including a very large finished basement. The HEOS 5 has noticeably deeper and fuller sound. It is crystal clear, which surprised me coming through wireless channels. I do not own a Sonos system, but I have played around with them in the store and I prefer the HEOS 5 to the Sonos Play:5. It's a toss up between the HEOS 3 & Sonos Play:3. I prefer my Bose Soundlink II to both 3 models, and the Soundlink is the entry model for Bose.The HEOS 5 is the real winner here. I would put 3's in your bathrooms, workrooms, and kitchen but would not use it as a main speaker for a larger room. The 5 belongs in the living room or den.BUFFER ISSUES: Some other users reported problems with the speakers cutting out. With my Internet set up I have not had that problem unless more than one other bandwidth intensive program, like Netflix is running. If our kids are watching Netflix while my wife is watching it in another room, the sound will break up once in a while.SYNC ISSUES: When playing the same speaker source all of the HEOS speakers play the music perfectly in sync. There is no lag that we have experienced in between any of them.I am happy with the HEOS 3, but am blown away by the HEOS 5. As good as it is, I will have to get my hands on the 7 now.","rating":5},{"comment":"*Setup*The setup procedure is everything Denon promises - simple and the app walks you through every step.  You don't need to know anything about wireless networks except for your password.This simplicity can come at a cost under some situations.  After setup, I had some VERY weird behavior from the app and speaker, which highlighted the fact that if there IS a problem, the app is terrible at helping you figure out what is wrong.  I'll put all that at the end as most people won't need that info, but I also point out some really great features of the app which you probably don't know exist, so if you're really considering this system, it might be worth your time to read.*Build Quality*Fit and finish is excellent.  Rubber bumpers will protect furniture in either the horizontal or vertical position and it has a metal threadmount if you wanted to utilize it.  Denon does recommend 1 foot clearance in all directions for dissipation of heat since it is a self-amplified speaker.  You wouldn't want to flush-mount the speaker or you'd block the port in the rear.*Sound*Ok, so let's talk sound.  For me, every speaker has a tradeoff between its sound components and all the extra fluff.  Would this speaker hold up to a $300 self-powered speaker that doesn't build in Wireless?  Probably not.  But compared to similar Bluetooth speakers (I'm thinking mainly of my Bose SoundLink portable, which was roughly the same price and which I've owned for a few years), it does hold up pretty well.  It doesn't have the greatest stereo separation, especially when positioned vertically, but for casual listening, it's fine.  Clarity falls off pretty sharply when off-axis.  Bass at low volumes is very nice - it doesn't fall off just because you turn the overall volume down.  Voices are clear and instruments are fairly well defined, but overall sometimes I feel like some of the depth of the music is missing.  I hear bass, I hear vocals, but the rest kind of feels like it's trapped behind a curtain and just can't get through to really shine.  Again, you're not getting much more than other speakers in this price range that offer some competing feature set (portability, battery power, Bluetooth, etc).The EQ settings and orientation settings are in the app, but are buried pretty deep.  Unfortunately, you can only control Bass and Treble and changing your iPhone's EQ settings won't have any effect within the HEOS app.  Read the troubleshooting section for instructions on how to find HEOS app's EQ menu.  As for stereo imaging, there are two drivers in the speaker, but they are very close together. When standing upright, you don't really hear stereo sound because the drivers are stacked on top of each other. Laying on its side might help, but since they're so close to each other, it's kind of like any other small speaker in that it's hard to get nice separation from the channels. I'm still undecided if the speaker drivers are working in stereo or if it's some sort of DSP that tries to give it a stereo effect - kind of like simulated surround sound from a pair of speakers in the front of a room.  I think it really is playing the music in stereo, it's just really hard to tell.Update: As I've listened more, the weaknesses in the HEOS3's sound stem primarily from its strong directionality in how mids and highs are dispersed.  Especially in the vertical position, the drivers don't disperse the sound throughout the room, but focus straight ahead.  Standing 8-10 feet from the speaker, you can hear the mids and highs drop out at about 45 degrees from its center.*HEOS app*Operation is simple but still a bit clunky.  All control is through the app, so even if you connect a usb stick or a device via the aux cable, you MUST have an iPhone or Android with the app installed.  The app is basic on the surface and there's a few features that aren't well advertised.  For instance, there IS a mute button in the app in addition to the Pause.  It's the little speaker icon next to the Volume bar, which sits just below the skip and pause\/play buttons.  When Muted, the song continues to stream, unlike pause which stops both the audio and playback of the song.By default it doesn't show elapsed time or time remaining for a track.  These aren't available at all in the iPhone's playlist view, which to me is disappointing.  If you want to see time elapsed\/remaining, you have to be in the song view, then tap on the album cover.  Oddly, this is also the only place where you can choose to repeat or shuffle tracks in the current playlist.  That's right, you have to do it from the currently playing song view, you can't do it in the playlist view!When changing volume, there's a bit of a lag between the app and the speaker.  Sometimes this lag is also present when pausing\/starting songs.  I guess that's a function of having to traverse the wireless network rather than being directly connected via Bluetooth.  Thereing also lies the musical shortcomings of this system.  You can only play audio from Denon's app and whichever partners it chooses to integrate.  For instance, if you have iHeartRadio installed, you can't play from it to the HEOS wirelessly.  You might be able to do it by connecting your phone via the aux cable and then selecting that as the input, then starting the iHeartRadio app.  I'm sure this would apply to the multitude of other apps like Rdio, Amazon Cloud Player, etc.  That could be a real shortcoming.While we're on the subject of audio choices, while the HEOS app sees all music on your phone, it doesn't seem to connect to Windows PCs or other media servers.  If it does, I certainly haven't figured it out, but sure would like to.  So if you have, then clue me in!You DO NOT need a HEOS account to play music from an iPhone.  If you want to store playlists in the HEOS app, use the online streaming services built into the app, or maintain a play history, you will need an account.  When using your iPhone, it will access your iPhone playlists just fine, and you can even select combinations of playlists and single songs to build a HEOS queue of music to play.  HEOS then lets you manually rearrange the song playback order if you want.*Wifi operation*The strength and weakness is operation over wifi.  See the troubleshooting section for more info, especially if it's behaving weirdly.  Overall, the app seems to buffer around 5-15 seconds of audio, so you'll know quickly if you're out of range.  You can see wifi signal strength stats if you go deep enough into the menus, but I wish the app showed the simple \"bars\" each speaker has. Also, it can be laggy for some operations and doesn't give as many listening options as a simple bluetooth connection.  That said, it's got greater range and bandwidth so there's some really nice advantages and features that Bluetooth simply can't do.  One really weird thing is that when your phone\/speaker loses the wifi connection then reconnects, it'll try skipping to the next song in the queue as if the problem was the song instead of the connection.  It seems that since it runs out of buffer, the speaker tells the app to go to the next song because it doesn't know if the song was done or not.  I have no idea why the app just can't tell the speaker to pick up where it left off.Update: I've been able to run the speaker even when my phone is on the 2.4GHz band but the speaker is on the 5.  Sometimes it works great, and other times it won't.  Not sure yet why that is.*Conclusion*OK, so all that said, would I recommend this speaker?  Yes, I would.  Bluetooth speakers have a whole host of issues.  Pairing becomes an issue, especially in a multi-device household.  With the HEOS app, it's much easier to select a speaker and play music.  Sound is on-par with other speakers in this price range.  This one might not be my favorite, but it's still sufficient.  Compared to other wifi systems like Bose, Samsung and Sonos, it's simply too much to try and say how HEOS compares to each.  Samsung and Sonos both use a proprietary \"bridge\" which creates a dedicated network for the speakers.  While this might add to reliability and avoid some of the issues I've had, the tradeoff is that you're limited by the range of the wifi network created by that dedicated bridge.  Every system has its advantages and disadvantages.The HEOS system is expandable and most of the shortcomings are more on the app and software end, which I'm sure Denon can fix and improve over time.  WiFi has a much larger range within your house, so you don't lose the music when walking away from the speaker, nor do you have to leave your phone close to it or attached to it like other \"dock\" systems.Is it perfect? No, but I think it's a solid 4-star device.*Troubleshooting and Advanced HEOS App tips*Here's the problem I ran into: It would play part of a song, stop, think for about 30 seconds, move to the next song in the playlist and play about .5 seconds of it, then repeat that process until it ran out of songs to try by hitting the end of the playback queue. The app would look like the very first song was playing.  If it did throw an error, it would say something like \"The speaker cannot playback audio right now, please try again later.\"  Really?!  This isn't a doctor's office that'll open again in the morning, this thing should work!  And if it doesn't, then it needs to say why.I checked for updates in the app and it said I was on the latest version. About 15 minutes later, the app popped up a screen saying the speaker needed updated. I assume it meant the firmware within the speaker rather than the iOS app itself. OK, no big deal except that the screen had two options - Update Now or Update Later, but the Update Later wasn't able to be selected. Upgrade took about 10 minutes but I still had issues with playback as described above. I was doing all this in my living room, where I've got a good wireless signal and it was nighttime, so no other devices were really using our wireless as everyone else was in bed - no xbox, tvs, phones, kindles, etc being actively used.I think I figured out the problem and it's due to the way I have my wireless network setup.  I have a dual band router that works on both the 2.4 and 5GHz bands.  I have them running on separate SSIDs so that I can tell what I'm connected to.  Well, the speaker was on one SSID and my phone was connected to the opposite.  When the signal gets low on the 5GHz band on my phone, it'll switch to the 2.4GHz one automatically.  So even though both networks are going through the same wireless router, it throws the app off kilter (maybe because they're two different SSIDs), but setting the networks the same, it seems to be working fine now.  The only issue is that since my phone will connect to either network, I have to check it when the speaker cuts out.  If you have your network setup this way or you experience this issue, this might be the cause.OK, so I figured out the problem, but this also highlighted something else for me - the app is really clunky to navigate.  I had to figure out which SSID the speaker was connected to - seems simple, but remember during the setup, it won't even ask which network to connect to.  It seems to choose whichever one your phone is connected to at the time of setup.  To check or change which network the speaker is on, do the following: Click the \"Music\" button at the bottom of the app.  If it's not on the main screen where you select from Pandora, Spotify, your phone, etc, then use the back arrow in the upper left of the app to back all the way out to this main screen.  Once there, there is a cog icon in the upper left.  This is your Settings menu.  Why it's buried in \"Music\" is beyond me.  It would make more sense to be a main selection or in Rooms.  Anyway, click it, then select \"My Devices\".  You'll then see the list of your speakers, so select one.  Then you get the speaker's setting menu.  The \"Network\" option shows your current network that speaker is on.  Clicking this will then scan for all available networks so you can change it.  Note that it doesn't appear to allow hopping between networks like a phone\/tablet, etc does.  I presume this is to prevent the exact problem I'm having.  So while it might prevent issues from the speaker hopping networks, your phone or tablet can still cause the problem by doing so.But guess what, this is a real gem of a settings menu!  In it, you find not only the Network info, but also the ability to rename the speaker, settings for EQ, Orientation (for the HEOS 3 it has a separate setting for vertical vs. horizontal), as well as setting the Audio for Left, Right, or Both (Since the HEOS3 can work either as a single speaker or can work as a pair like traditional speakers.  Under the Advanced option, you find Network interface (Wireless vs. wired),  your network password (in case you change it), IP Address Settings (DHCP, IP Address, Subnet, gateway, and DNS).  At the bottom of this menu, there's an additional button for Firmware Upgrade (which shows if you need to update) and an About button which shows Hardware info (Speaker model, revision and module), Software (Player version and Release), Device (Locale, LAN, WLAN mac addresses).  Seriously, Denon, you buried all these goodies way down here!Denon could really make the app a lot easier to use.","rating":4},{"comment":"The wireless speaker is very simple and doesn't come with a lot. You get a speaker, ethernet cable, audio cable, and power supply cord which can change adapters. You actually have to snap the tongs that go into the outlet into this power supply. So I guess you could use this speaker internationally as well if you have the snap on adpater available.I setup this speaker using it with my Samsung Galaxy S5 phone, and it took up about 32.49MB of storage on the phone. Setup is very easy, just following the instructions, you just plug in the speaker to an outlet, Upload the app on your phone, and then connect the audio cable (included) to headphone jack on the phone to the AUX input jack on the speaker. Then just press the connect button on the back on the speaker, and enter in your network password on the phone and tada you are finished setting it up. You phone is now connected to the speaker.You do have to create a HEOS account to start playing music, and if you don't have the apps that are featured on the HEOS app: Pandora, spotify, tunein, and Rhapsody...you will have to upload those apps to your phone as well. Since my phone is new to me I had to upload pandora in order to start listening to it through the speaker.After a couple minutes in, the HEOS app wanted to do a software update which took about 5 minutes to do. That took longer than the initial setup actually.If you worry about permissions needed when loading the HEOS app on your phone it asks for permission to: Read phone status identity, record audio, modify or delete the content of USB storage, full network access, and allow wifi multicast reception.Using the speaker you can either control the volume on the speaker or on the app on your phone. The speaker has a mute button, the app doesn't. Overall the speaker is easy to use, the volume is very loud and clear with no static. I used pandora with it and it was very easy to understand and use. You use pandora within the HEOS app in order to hear the music through the speaker. If you just go to the Pandora app it would only play on your phone unless you have the audio cable connecting your phone to the speaker. You can also play music that you already have on your phone and it has a local music button on the HEOS app but it was empty when I pressed on it so I am not sure what that is. I thought it might be local radio channels, but nothing popped up.You can also play music on the cloud, like for instance Amazon Prime Music streaming. To do this, you have to plug your phone into the speaker, you can't do this wirelessly from what I can see. You plug your phone into the speaker using the AUX input option and then you go into the Amazon music app if you have that on your phone and it will start playing on the speaker. Using the AUX input option to play music seems to not have as good sound quality as playing it wirelessly though.The only thing that I didn't find straightforward and easy with this speaker, was how to stop playing music when you are done. At first it seems easy. In my phones notification task bar there is the HEOS app icon with a big large red circle with a X on it. Which I assumed meant stop the music from playing and end connection to speaker. But when I pressed it, the music was still coming out of the speaker, just the app was off my phones screen now. So, I opened the app again, paused the music and then pressed the x button to stop the music.But I really like this speaker, it is small but packs a punch in the volume. My house isn't that big and I can hear this speaker throughout my house easily without it on the loudest setting either. I can change the music that is playing in my bedroom while I am in the kitchen with my phone. It has a simple design with just a volume up\/down button and a mute button other than that you control everything from your phone. Because it is so simple and light weight you can just take it to any room as long as you have an outlet nearby to play music. Overall a great speaker, my favorite part is the simplicity of it.-------HEOS 5Setting up the HEOS 5 is just as easy as with the HEOS 3. The one thing is, I had my HEOS 3 speaker a couple days longer so I didn't setup them up on the same day. HEOS 5 speaker wanted to do an update just like HEOS 3 did, but it was having some trouble updating. It kept telling the speaker couldn't update. And the two speakers would not group until it did its update. I had to unplug both of my speakers a couple times before the update took affect.Together the speakers work wonderfully. You can group the speakers together and have them playing the same song. Or have them playing separate pandora playlist as well. When they are grouped together you can either change the volume of one speaker separately or change them together as one; It gives you both options. So one speaker can be louder than the other if they are in different rooms.Overall it is very easy to use both speakers together in the HEOS app on the phone. It is very simple and isn't overwhelming.","rating":5},{"comment":"This review is for the HEOS 3.  This speaker has excellent sound, specifically bass, which is hard to find at times.  You can store the speaker horizontal or vertical, which makes it versatile for any location.  As long as you have a nearby plug in, this speaker is small enough to fit easily in many locations.  It is supposed to be for a small room, but it works well for medium sized rooms as well.Set up was easy, once I changed out my router.  I have an old router that has issues, and my set up wasn't going well.  I pulled out a newer router, and used the enclosed ethernet cable.  Once I did this, the setup process just flew through.  I have an Iphone 5s and a Netgear router.The only thing I don't like about this speaker is that I wish it was bluetooth.  It isn't, and it doesn't claim to be, but it would be nice because then you would be able to play other apps on your speaker.  I use aSony SRSBTX500 Portable NFC Bluetooth Wireless Premium Speaker Systemto play my Sirius radio app, and I love it.  With the Denon speaker, you can only play the apps that come on the HEOS app.  You have Pandora, Tunein, Rhapsody, Spotify and the music that you have loaded to your phone.  In order to be able to use Pandora, for example, you must have that app also downloaded on your phone.  Those are great selections, and some of the best music apps available, but it would be nice to have Amazon Prime music and Sirius available to play.The sound quality of this speaker is awesome!  It plays music on Pandora with such clarity, and the bass is super.  I live in an apartment, so I had to keep the sound turned at a decent volume, which turned out to be about 1\/4 of the volume that it is capable of achieving.  The Tune-In app that allows you to play radio, doesn't come in as impressive as Pandora.It will be nice to have several set up, and see how they all work together.  I would recommend it, if you are looking for a home system that spans through several rooms.  Perhaps, Denon will add a few more apps in the future.","rating":5},{"comment":"The first and most frustrating thing I noticed about this device - you cannot use Amazon Prime Music (or the Amazon music cloud), Google music, or any of the music downloaded onto my Samsung Galaxy phone with the HEOS app.I use a Sonos system at work, and that system does have more support and it can play music from my device.  No matter how I try, I cannot get the HEOS app to locate any of the music files on my phone.What it does support is Pandora (and a few other apps).  It also has the ability to be hard wired in, but that defeats the purpose of the device.  I can hard wire into my receiver - but very annoying for a wireless device to not have more options for streaming wireless music.For now, go with the cheaper Sonos systems.  The sound is comparable but the Sonos app supports a lot more 3rd party streaming services as well as easier access to music actually on the device.  I will update the review if this changes.","rating":3},{"comment":"For my setup I got the HEOS 3 and HEOS 5.  I got the HEOS 3 first and tried it out by itself, the app was easy to install on my iPhone 5.  Setup was super easy, I really like the use of the 3.5mm cable to set it up from the phone, that is pretty smart!  This made setup and connection to my WiFi super easy.  After that the app allows you to control the speaker.The app works really well, but still needs some work (especially with applying updates), I kept getting update is complete and than constantly getting update needed messages, until it finally downloaded, until this update was applied to both units I could not group them together.  I will add that I do not love that I have to login to my music accounts through the app.  I think some form of interception of the native music player controls in iOS wold have been the best route, instead of routing the music stream through your web service, since I really do not like giving you my logins.  For now, this works, and maybe in the future a better mechanism for streaming with native apps might be introduced.  The app is also a little confusing with the layout, this is not an issue, but it was just an odd layout, maybe a better workflow could improve user experience, and make getting to speaker settings and other items easier.The speaker performed well, however, this smaller one (the HEOS 3) had a hard time with heavier bass and at higher volumes heavy bass was not understandable (to much rattle).  I tried adjusting the bass\/treble in the app, but it really did not seem to change anything (maybe a bug?).  The trouble with bass in the HEOS 3 would knock it down a star, but the system as a whole and great sound from the HEOS 5 gives it 5 stars.  It would be nice if it could handle better sound quality even with heavier bass items.  The HEOS 5 did not have an issue with heavier bass.The HEOS 5 was just as easy to setup and use as the HEOS 3.  The HEOS5 had great sound and could handle bass and other heavy peaks better than the HEOS 3.  For a richer sound I would go for the HEOS 5.When I got the HEOS 5 I tried different settings and played with what all they could do.  This is a pretty cool system.I was able to easily identify where in the house each speaker was (you can set a name) and could easily drag them into groups to get the same audio playing on both of them or could have each one playing its own feed.  The audio was in sync between the two speakers which is usually the biggest issue when setting up multi speakers, I could not hear any lapse or delay on either speaker, they were perfectly synced!A cool feature was that I could plug in a 3.5mm in the aux on one speaker and pair both speakers together and have both speakers playing the aux input off of the one speaker.The app was easy to use, and in the future it would be nice for a computer application that could allow the same functionality so I could use these off a server or laptop without keeping my phone connected (if this is possible through a web service I did not see it; but this product is still new, so it could be something in the future).In the end I am really happy with this.  It was super easy to use and the audio quality was pretty good for a speaker this size.  The speaker is easy to setup and was super easy to use.  The HEOS 3 did not have as great of support for louder bass heavy audio, but the HEOS 5 did.  For a great wireless speaker setup with multi speaker support this is a great choice!","rating":5},{"comment":"Tested both the HEOS 3 and HEOS 5 as part of an Apple Airport based wifi system, with Verizon FIOS high speed throughput, and iOS app. The two speakers are similar, with the HEOS 5 being a bit larger, heavier, and having better overall sound quality.Packaging is what one would expect from a high-end manufacturer, comparable to Apple\/Oppo\/etc. Packaging includes the mini-mini audio cable, ethernet cable, AC converter, the speaker, and clear directions. The HEOS 3 speaker itself can be bolted to the wall or can sit vertically or horizontally. I preferred the sound with a horizontal placement, but note that there is a significant degree of variability depending upon what you use as a base. For example, in the kitchen, if you place the speaker on a granite countertop, you will have quite a bit more high end due to reflectivity than if you place the speaker on a wood cabinet top near the ceiling of the room. The HEOS 5 has a single orientation and no wall mount.Setup took just a few minutes including the download of the HEOS app, firmware upgrade for the speaker, and entering my wifi system password. No bugs encountered with setup and the app is just about ready for primetime. There was one point where I entered a \"Demo\" mode by accident through the Local Music entry; the app had no clear method for exiting and returning to standard playback. I reset it and started over.Sound quality is superb, especially considering that with a single speaker, you are essentially listening to a mix down of 2 channel audio to a single source. With two speakers, one would think there would be a way to set one as the Left channel and the other as the Right channel, but this is possible only for the HEOS 3, which can be set as L, R, or L+R. The HEOS 5 is always providing both channels in one container, leaving you with wanting two HEOS 3's if you want one as L and the other as R. Bass is quite good on the HEOS 3 - more vibrant and less boomy than with competing products. There's a nice midrange for vocals, which are easily interpreted over the music, and the high end, while not quite as full as I'd like, can be equalized up within the app. The HEOS 5 has significantly improved low midrange and upper bass response, and the 3 is somewhat muddier by comparison, something I hadn't noticed when I originally listened to the 3 by itself. I chose the kitchen for the HEOS 3, where music is often competing with cooking noises, exhaust fans, hums of various appliances, and conversation. The ultimate in stereo isn't necessary, but good high fidelity sound is. The HEOS 3 easily provides the necessary volume and frequency response without clipping or distortion. In a day of playing, I experienced no wifi dropouts or other such difficulties. The software allows the two speakers to run the identical source, at user-selectable volumes, or two independent streams of music (one room for partying, the other for relaxation?).Music sources include any music on my iPhone, which will then stream via wifi to the speaker. The HEOS app includes access to your existing accounts on Spotify, Pandora, and Rhapsody. I used my Pandora account without difficulty. I tried to access my Beats account, but this didn't work through the HEOS app. The only way to use Beats at the moment would be to connect it to the HEOS with a hard wired connection from my iPhone. I understand Beats will be supported in the future however. I tried my Spotify premium account but all that happened is that the HEOS app launched the Spotify app, which then played through the iPhone rather than streaming. After searching online, I discovered that there is, in fact, a way to utilize Spotify through a completely non-intuitive user interface (Spotify's fault, not Denon's) that can be accessed only through the Now Playing section of the app rather than from the Settings section. So now I can use my own library, Spotify, and Pandora.Overall this is a well-constructed product with very good software support. I'd look for just a little more clean-up on the HEOS iOS app to get the UI just right, and greater availability of specifications so users can easily figure out how\/whether they are getting mono R, mono L, or a mix down of both channels, as well as instructions as to how to set this as a user with each speaker being placed.","rating":5},{"comment":"We have the Heos 3 and the Heos 5 systems. Aside from audio quality, the setup and experience is the same. I'll start with audio quality, then the rest of the review will cover using the system, which should be the same over both speakers.The Heos 3 and 5 both have quite desirable sound quality. The 5 seems to have more base and sound travels out both sides of the speaker, while the 3 only sends sound in one direction. I'd recommend the 5 for a central sound device and the 3 for a corner. Both these speakers pack quite a punch for their size. I don't have a reference point for their sound compared to speakers with similar prices.Setup is reasonably simple. Just install the Heos app on your Android (what we did) or iDevice and hook up to the speaker via the provided AUX cable and your headphone jack on the device. Just follow the instructions and have your wifi password ready. I had no troubles doing this. I'd recommend looking for updates, as both the speakers we got had them available.The main issue I have with these speakers is the app and available sources of music. Our music is all in Google Music, and this is not available at this time. Nor is Amazon music. There is however, hope for more support later, as well as the current apps, such as Pandora (which we also use), Rhapsody, TuneIn, and Spotify. It's a bit clunky to use, however. You have to first create a Heos account, then log into your other accounts. This will allow, at least, you to use any Heos app you log into on any device without having to log into your other accounts every time (I'm fairly certain at least).What no one needs is another ecosystem to have to mess with. What would be really nice would be the ability to have an app that would stream sound from any app to the speakers. It's a bit unfortunate the speaker access is limited in this way. However, there are some good things about the app and the speakers.You can play music stored locally on the tablet or device. It only looks in the Music folder, so if you have music elsewhere, you can't just grab it, you have to move it (as far as Android is concerned, at least.) You don't need to mess with the Heos account for this. Also, from Windows 7 or 8 you can right click any folder  and select Play To and choose any of the speakers to send music in that folder to. Then, using the app, you can group speakers and play to multiple Heos speakers. You can also send single files, or add more to the playlist. We've not yet tested streaming saved playlists, so this may also be an option. When I try to access network files, I cannot stream them. I do not know the cause of this limitation.You can also hook an AUX cable into the speaker and play anything into the speaker, and propagate the sound out to other speakers in the same way as above. This may not be ideal for playing TV or movies, since it buffers, and might not be in sync to the screen.From the app you can adjust volume, the bass and treble EQ, name and rename the speakers from a preset list (Bedroom, Living Room, etc) or choose any arbitrary name you desire.On each speaker you can mute them (this will not pause the audio) and adjust volume.If you are already within the provided ecosystems then you will have better access to your music. As it is, we can only access what we have available on our Android devices and what is on our PCs (and even then that is limited. Using a Media server may fix that, but I don't have one set up to try it).The speakers sound great and just needs to use a more open platform to connect to them. We've experimented, but haven't figured out a better solution yet. We can recommend them for the great sound they will push across your wirelessly connected home, but with some hesitancy over the limited access you may have to your music.","rating":4},{"comment":"I received a single Heos 3 and a single Heos 5. This review is for both speakers with differences noted (hereafter referred to as 3 and 5).The future of our wireless world will include speakers located wherever you have an outlet with the ability to play whatever and however we want. The Heos gets this future half right by succeeding with the hardware and falling short with the software.HARDWARE-The 3 design is elegant, edgy, and modern especially when positioned vertically. The 5 has a more traditional, boring rectangular look and can only be positioned horizontally.-Both have a nice blue accent light at the base but no way to turn it off.SOUND-Treble and bass can be adjusted via the app.-The Heos 3 produces fantastic sound for a speaker of its size. Well-balanced in all frequencies. Crisp vocals. Surprisingly good bass.-The Heos 5 felt a little heavy on the bass even after adjusting the bass down. The vocals were not as crisp possibly due to the overdone bass.-Both speakers play loud enough to fill a large living room without distortion.-Overall, I prefer the sound of the Heos 3 as it is better balanced with crisp vocals without sacrificing much bass.MUSIC SOURCESCurrently, you are limited to only what you can play via the Heos app (Pandora, Spotify, TuneIn, Rhapsody, local phone files) which does not include Google Music, Amazon Music, or any podcast app. You also can't stream from a desktop computer to use Windows Media Player or a Youtube music video playlist.Since I have all my music and playlists on the Google Music cloud, the only way to use it with the Heos is directly connecting a 3.5mm cable to my phone's headphone jack. This is rather inelegant in today's wireless world.APP CONTROLS-Ability to group speakers to play the same music works generally well. I like how you can control volume of each speaker independently even within the same group.-I encountered some bugginess with the groups. Initially, when I tried to group the 3 + 5, the software would freeze. Sometimes when I grouped my 3 + 5, I would have another group of only the 3. My 2 speakers had magically become 3 speakers. With continued use, the bugginess seems to have resolved itself though.-Each Heos can play different music at the same time from the same phone app which adds flexibility.-I was able to aux cable connect my phone to the 3 and stream Google Music only out of the 5. That's pretty cool if you think about it. It makes me wonder why I need a wire at all.-It isn't obvious how to control each Heos separately and it isn't explained well in the manual. You must first go to the \"Rooms\" tab, select the group, then either go to the \"Music\" tab to select your source or go to the \"Now Playing\" tab to start\/stop the music. You need to go back to the \"Rooms\" tab whenever you want to control a different speaker or group.OVERALLThe hardware is undoubtedly fantastic. For most people, I would recommend the Heos 3 over the Heos 5 because of its balanced sound and elegant design. If you want heavy bass though, go with the 5.The software could stand improvements in the ease of controls. More importantly, Denon MUST devise a way to allow you to use whatever sound source you want otherwise this will be a dealbreaker for many people. If you are like me and fully integrated into the Google Music player, the only way to stream is via a 3.5mm aux cable. C'mon Denon, this is 2014, not 1990. I'm not going to buy a product that turns my smartphone into a corded phone.If Denon can figure out a way to allow you to stream music from your phone in whatever fashion you choose, the Heos dramatically improves in value and is a solid 5 stars. The ability to stream from a desktop computer would add a ton of value as well.Denon has stated that the software will be regularly updated so I will update here accordingly.","rating":3},{"comment":"I have a bit of a love\/hate relationship with this product and suspect most others will encounter a similar response when first using.The GoodMake no mistake about it, these sound terrific. I was delighted to receive these via the Amazon Vine program for review (for other viners, it was just plain luck...no bots, no super sonic connection). Since we have mostly transitioned to online storage and streaming these made perfect sense for our needs.Packaging - Right from the start you will notice the superior design - the box, instructions and so forth are both attractive and functional.....qualities that expand to the product perfectly.Design - I'm delighted by the design of these speakers...adore how they play from two sides and can be situated in a variety of convenient and practical settings. While these are not ultra small, they also are not huge. The only thing you will need is an electric outlet...no more ugly wires! The speakers have three buttons on the top (volume up\/down and mute) as well as a few small contacts in the back (hdmi, aux jack, connect button etc). Very minimal design which makes it easy to use.Sound - Both the HEOS 3 and 5 sound great but there is a notable difference between the two; the HEOS 3 has a solid sound but not necessarily quite as rich...especially in the bass and lower range...as the 5. It is perfect as a group which is how I prefer to use (more on that in a moment). The HEOS 5 is an impressive speaker and provides ample sound in a good sized room...roughly 400 sq ft with cathedral ceilings. We opted to pair it with the HEOS 3 for use in the kitchen and nook (about another 250 sq ft)and have no gaps nor diminished sound quality. Is able to handle LOUD music without distortion but also equally up to the task of classical, jazz etc...Ease of Installation - As mentioned, we opted to install these in the living room and kitchen area while removing the last of the wired ugliness...basically plug and play. No wires, no cutting holes in the ceiling, no holes in the walls. Just great sound that fills the room with ease.Function - One of the innovative features of this isn't just the two sided speakers (okay, I just love the design of the speakers...even the handle makes sense!) but how they operate together or independently. This sets the system above the rest and is a great feature! For example, spouse can listen to those beloved talk shows that I personally despise while I listen to my own selection OR we can both enjoy music from room to room by syncing them together...the music \"follows\" you throughout the house. This is a very nifty feature and the first time I've ever encountered it in a home system.The BadNO Access to My Favorite Cloud Service! As enthusiastic as we are about this product there are serious irritations...namely, I do NOT get to use my \"favorite cloud service\" which happens to be Amazon. It comes pre-loaded with Spotify, Pandora and a few others which would be nice if I actually wanted to use them...but I don't. Amazon is my media company...I love keeping my books, movies and music all in one place.This is a very serious  limitation in my mind however, I did not dock the product for one simple reason...I am HOPING Denon comes out with an update that includes Amazon asap. Plus, I didn't feel right docking the product when Amazon itself launched their new Fire TV device without access to the streaming music app (which was also seriously annoying especially since it was an Amazon product!). Fire Tv went on to add the music app after a couple of months so hopefully Denon will follow up by adding more providers in the very near future.It is possible to use the aux as a work-around and stream whatever you want directly from the device but it rather limits the full potential and adds one more layer of \"connection\" that limited the placement of the speakers to where we could \"plug in\". Again, not a huge deal breaker but it defeats some of the potential of the product.Set-Up - Yes, set-up is supposed to be easy but should you hit a glitch in the road there is nearly zero help available. For instance, when using the aux it wasn't initially apparent that you had to go through multiple steps that had a slight lag...expecting instant connection, I kept hitting buttons and thought it didn't work only to later realize it was due to a lag. Additionally, when I first grouped the speakers, the latency between speakers was really bad...basically the two songs were playing off sync with one speaker falling behind almost a full second. Very disorienting. Nothing I tried fixed it so I turned everything off and started from the beginning...doing everything all over again and this time the grouping worked perfectly. What went wrong and how did I fix it? I still haven't the slightest idea but it now sounds great. My point is that although this is a very simple system, sometimes less isn't more...sometimes it's just too little information that leads to more frustration if things don't go perfectly.Bottom line - the limitation on streaming music choices was a major disappointment but I've held back on docking a point because Amazon FireTV took two months to add their own app to their device...hopefully Denon will expand streaming options very soon. Since the official release date isn't out yet, more popular options may be available by that point and time. Currently options are limited to Pandora, Spotify and a few others but be forewarned, your favorite provider may NOT be included yet.On the other hand, GREAT sound, GREAT design, Ultimate flexibility, easy to expand, love the grouping function. Designed with streaming in mind so Denon...please expand to include Amazon Cloud\/music asap!!!!","rating":5},{"comment":"This powerful but relatively small speaker from Denon was a delight when I first put it into my home, but as I used it more, I started to discover some of its limitations.  The quality of what it is able to do is not to be understated - this is a tremendous speaker and a joy to hear.  However, given the cost and the capability, there are some basic features I was surprised it was missing.  In this review, I will first describe what I liked, and then describe what it is missing.  With that knowledge, you can hopefully decide if this speaker is for you.  To summarize, despite the limitations I am quite happy with it and would overall recommend you buy it, but I want you to make the most educated decision you can make given the cost.Opening the box, the speaker was amazingly easy to setup.  You plug it in and download an app to your iPad or iPhone called HEOS.  The speaker has a jack for a wired ethernet, but it also has built-in WiFi.  You can enter your home WiFi password via the iPad app.  Just plug the iPad headphone cord into the AUX IN, and apparently it programs the password into the speaker via the AUX IN audio input.  It's a pretty cool reuse of a port to allow you to program the speaker.  The speaker has an unobtrusive LED under a colored bumper that glows yellow if it is not connected and blue once it connects.Since this is the HEOS 3, it is a small portable speaker (weighing just over 4 lbs) that you can plug in anywhere.  I hid it on top of our breakfront behind some woodwork.  I opened the HEOS app, picked a Pandora station, and started the music.  The sound was unbelievable.  It resonated with deep, warm bass that was not overpowering, clear trebles, and a fullness that allowed the entire room to fill with sound from 1 speaker while not sounding loud.  This is the sign of a top quality speaker - the sound is full without being loud.  I cycled through rock, classical, jazz, a cappella, and even news talk radio.  All of them sounded perfect.  I have owned many speakers in my life, and this is clearly one of the best speakers I have owned.  The speaker itself is top quality.  If you've ever tried a bluetooth speaker, the sound from this speaker far exceeds what you might have heard through bluetooth - it is truly HD quality music.Now the software to play the music is interesting.  You need to sign up for a free HEOS account, and it seems to essentially act like a cloud playing to your speaker.  If you have multiple devices all running HEOS, they stay synchronized.  Change the song on your iPhone, and it changes on your iPad.  This is kind of cool - anyone in the family can play a song from their own iDevice.  You can pick between internet radio stations Pandora Radio, Spotify, TuneIn (local stations), or Rhapsody.  You can also play local music off of the iPad, local music from a USB memory stick plugged into the speaker, or just use the AUX Input for anything.  The player also allows you to control multiple speakers to play the same or different stations simultaneously.Notably absent is any way to play music from a source on your iPad other than the 4 listed music services.  For instance, there is a radio station I listen to using the radio station app.  It is not on Pandora, Spotify, TuneIn, or Rhapsody - it is only on a separate app.  I could technically run a headphone cable from my iPad to the speaker AUX IN, but that defeats the point of the wireless.  I also can't listen to music in YouTube videos or play movies using the speaker.  For the high cost of this speaker, I want to get full use out of it, and can't unless I am using an old fashioned 3.5mm cable to plug it into my iPad.  That puts me back to needing my lower quality Bluetooth speaker for these applications.I was also surprised that there is no graphic equalizer for the music.  Even basic receivers and audio applications have equalizers, and there is nothing present here to adjust the tone and pitch of the music based on the genre.  This may sound nitpicky, but at this price you are competing with high cost home receivers, so missing this feature is disappointing.In terms of networking, I was quite happy that it recognized my local extension network.  The speaker was on my Netgear Nighthawk AC1900, but the iPad was on my Netgear AC750 extender.  The whole thing worked fine.  I was surprised that they didn't see fit to include some sort of repeater in the speaker itself.  They sell a \"range extender\" separately, but many of my WiFi devices including my WiFi security cameras now come with built-in repeaters so you can link together many distant cameras into a mesh network.  These WiFi cameras cost far less than this speaker, so I am surprised this feature is not present.Overall, the speaker is a delight to have hidden in the breakfront in our dining room.  It allows us to stream music without running speaker cables all over the house and we can adjust it from any one of our phones or iPads easily.  The 4 star rating reflects some obvious shortcomings, namely the inability to stream music outside of what is in the HEOS app (YouTube, videos, radio apps, etc), the lack of an equalizer, and the lack of a WiFi repeater.  For the cost of this system, I am disappointed to not get these features.  All of that being said, if these are not critical items for you, you will be very happy with this speaker in your home.","rating":4},{"comment":"After receiving the HEOS 5, I'm adding to this review which evaluated only the HEOS 3.  The original review of the HEOS 3 follows my observations on the new component.The HEOS by Denon audio system is made for a consumer like me, a person who loves good audio, attractive components, and an uncomplicated setup.  Offered in three versions, I now have the 3 and 5, greater numbers designate an increase in the size and output, speakers currently consist of 3, 5, and 7.  I love my first, the HEOS 3, but with the HEOS 5 addition, I'm blown away by the improvement in audio quality.  Setup is the same for both speakers and each was immediately in need of a system update.  Within a few minutes, music was streaming via WiFi to both speakers from my Pandora account.  At first, I wanted to compare them side by side to differentiate the audio quality.  With a nice built in groove for the hand to carry the HEOS 5, I was impressed by the tee-pee like shape which allows audio to surround the device, a feature lacking in the smaller speaker.  The 5 was far superior to the 3 and I already thought the 3 was a really good speaker.  Using the HEOS app on my HTC One M8 phone, I first sent the same track from one speaker, switching to the other.  Using the app, I then moved the icon of one into the other, thereby having them receive the same source at the same time.  It was heavenly.  I next moved the HEOS 3 speaker into another room and removed it from the joined setting in the app, allowing me to thereby play another track in the back room.  I had talk radio going in one room and opera in the other.  Audio level as well is controllable for each speaker separately, even when they are in the joined mode.  Whereas the 3 can be positioned either vertically or horizontally, the 5 is designed to play in a single position.  The HEOS 5 has 2 tweeters, mid-woofers and a passive radiator powered by 4 dedicated Class-D amplifiers, and the HEOS 3 has 2 full-range drivers and a 2 channel digital amplifier.  The 5 puts out a better quality audio, so if you can afford the price difference, I recommend going for the 5.Both speakers have a bright blue light at the base when the power is on and the speaker is ready to play.  The blue is the same as my cable boxes, a color I rather like.  Each speaker also has volume control buttons (+ and -) as well as a X button to cut off the audio.  I was happy to have these when my phone app had frozen and there was a knock on the door.INITIAL REVIEW: You Made Me Love You now plays on the Denon HEOS 3 Wireless Speaker and that pretty much sums up my budding relationship with this WiFi controlled little gem.  As described in the Amazon listing and the handy little accompanying QuickStart Guide, setup was a breeze, involving four simple steps.  I had already downloaded the HEOS by Denon App onto my new HTC One M8 Harmon Kardon Edition and even newer Samsung Galaxy S5, so one step was completed by the time the package arrived.  Connection to my network went without a hitch and the first song was being played using Pandora in less than ten minutes.  There was a brief pause when HEOS let me know an update was ready for installation, so I expect that you'll likely receive the same pause if you're an early purchaser.  I was prepared for the functionality of the app, but I must admit that because of the small size of the HEOS 3 and it's singular nature, I was skeptical of the audio output.  Well, no worries because even in my living\/dining room area which is the largest in the high ceiling condo,  the audio is top notch and well worth the price tag on this speaker.  I've listened to music from my phones, music from Pandora, local radio, and audio via a wired connection to my cable box and I have to report that it's all been great.  From my understanding of this HEOS system, when using more than one speaker from a wired tv connection, there is likely to be a lag in audio from the tv to the secondary speaker (or more if you have more connected.)  With a single speaker, it is without a problem and the audio\/video are virtually synched.  This speaker sounds equally as sweet in either horizontal or vertical position and because it's lightweight and a solid black in color, it's also visually attractive.  While on, there is a blue light which actually complements my cable box and the HEOS label is smaller than many logos on products.  Since I'm using this in WiFi mode, the only wire attached is the plug which is also well designed in that the actually adapter can be exchanged for one to fit your capability.  Should you desire, you can use the enclosed ethernet cable to connect to the HEOS system, but I have not needed that.  There is also a USB port, so if you have it loaded with music, you can access it on all HEOS speakers you have connected to your network.  I look forward to trying that out with a secondary speaker in the future.  As a frame of reference, I've been listening to Baroque music, Philip Glass, Justin Timberlake, assorted Jazz, Reggae, and a little Pink Floyd, just in the few hours the speaker has been in my home.  Not a bad sound for anything played thus far.Interesting, as I typed this, my WiFi went out, reminding me that without WiFi, there is nothing to drive the HEOS speakers unless you are wired into an auxiliary source.  When the cable reconnected, so did the HEOS.  Good to know.Now since this system is driven by the HEOS by Denon app which I'm certain will continuously be updated, here's what is on mine as of this minute:  PANDORA, Spotify, tunein, Rhapsody, This Phone, Local Music, Playists, History, and AUX Input.  I would like to see Amazon Music on here so that I do not have to download music from the cloud to the device or have my phone hardwired into the speaker.  When wired, the audio level is lower, requiring an adjustment made by pressing the button on the speaker itself.  Icons at the bottom of the screen are Rooms (speakers), Music, and Now Playing.  This is a very sensible approach, and it is very easy to get used to.  The Settings are minimal, even the Advanced Settings, but I suspect that these will also change over time.  The volume control is accessible from the Now Playing link and I've found the slide control to be a tad sticky, requiring some test movements until it became smooth for me.  The other buttons worked as needed.  Since I have a singular speaker, I am not able to try some of the functions available for multiples.  Just as the speaker is visually appealing, the app is soothing to the eyes and easy to navigate.I must also comment on the packaging of this speaker because it is outstanding.  The speaker is cushioned, wrapped securely, the accessories are protected in a lightweight black box which also slips soundly into the package, and the first thing you find upon opening the box is the HEOS 3 Quick Start Guide which is printed in English, French and finally, Spanish.  Even the manual is well constructed and attractive.  I'm sensitive to odors and found none to alarm me as I unpacked the speaker.  This was manufactured in China and there are several options presented should the need arise for customer service.There is a sheet which describes all that is covered in the TWO year warranty, and there is an additional pamphlet offering an extended service contract which is available only prior to the expiration of the original warranty period.  No registration sheet or card is included, but I assume that an account must be created in order to access the HEOS app, they have the information.I truly love this speaker and look forward to many hours of entertainment, provided my WiFi remains up and running.","rating":5},{"comment":"Update:  See end of review for thoughts on the HEOS 5 and the multi-room capability...----I've been looking forward to seeing how these speakers work since they were announced.  Denon has roots in the industry going back to 1910, and everything I've seen with its name on it has been very high quality.  These speakers are no different.The functionality of this product seems to take square aim at the offerings by Sonos.  The idea is to put a speaker in a room that can wirelessly access your music library (or an Internet source) for playback that's controlled by your iOS or Android device.  There are other uses which I'll get into here, but this is the basic idea.  And Denon executes this idea well.  Setup was extraordinarily simple, but there are some caveats:First, the speakers don't use Bluetooth...  No, this ties into your home WiFi network which the HEOS app on your phone then identifies.  On one hand this is easy, as you can control the playback from anywhere in the house provided you're on the same network as the speakers (Bluetooth range is limited and largely line-of-sight.).  On the other hand, it presumes you have WiFi.  And true, for the cool multi-room grouping\/playback design, WiFi is pretty much going to be required anyway.  I kind of wish there were a Bluetooth option though, if only to allow for additional flexibility.Second, as of this writing the control app is only available for iOS and Android.So I tested two setups. The first is using the speaker (The HEOS 3) as intended. I set it up via an iPhone 5 and my home WiFi. And as expected, it worked like gangbusters. Setup was crazy easy, and within ten minutes I was filling the room with the sweet, sweet musical stylings of The Beatles. And Jimmy Buffett. And Daft Punk. And Sinatra. And heck, I even played some Lindsey Stirling (don't judge me!). In every case, sound from the speaker was clear, solid, lush, and entirely appropriate to the genre. I don't know what Denon does to make this speaker sound so great, but it's working...the smallish size of the speaker belies it's range and power. And for someone who isn't overly technical, the sheer ease of setup is worth the price of admission here. In short, with the designed setup you get outstanding sound quality which is controlled by an easy-to-use app and a very painless setup procedure.I will say this...my home music library all lives on a MacBook Pro and is connected to my various iDevices via HomeShare.  To use the HEOS system, you have to play all of your music through the HEOS app.  Unfortunately, the HEOS app doesn't recognize my HomeShare library, only the music that's stored on the iDevice itself.  I'm hoping for an update where the app can recognize shared music libraries in addition to content stored on the iDevice.  It also won't recognize iTunes Radio...hopefully that is also a temporary thing.My second setup was intended to judge the speaker on its own merits - and for this I'll digress just a bit. I'm very interested in the Immersive Gaming concept, where developers build games with such rich virtual worlds that the player cannot help but become enmeshed in it. Well, sound quality is a huge part of Immersive Gaming (indeed, in some games, like Bioshock Infinite, the audio is just as much a part of the cast as the characters are...). Does this speaker hold up to an Immersive Gaming-type rig?Well, for this test I used a 2014 Alienware 17 attached via HDMI to a projector, with the speaker also attached to the projector via the AUX connection (note, for this kind of setup you'll still need the control app running on your iOS\/Android device...you just change the music source in the app to \"Aux input.\"  Therefore you cannot really play through the AUX unless both the speaker and the control app are connected via WiFi...). I then loaded up Arkham City and had Batman start doing his Hero thing. The range of the speakers, from low rumbles to higher pitched sounds, was fantastic, with no distortion that I could detect, and it filled the room admirably. It sounded as though Kevin Conroy was in my TV room. It scared my wife. It scared my dog.It scared *me*. Well, a little.So even though it seems kind of a waste (OK, very much a waste) to consign this speaker to gaming, in reality I think this shows a couple of things. First, the speaker itself is versatile enough to be useful across a variety of situations...in other words, it's easy to change roles. And second, the speaker itself is going to perform admirably in whatever setting you choose.Bottom line, this is an incredible speaker, so much so that the sound quality is apparent even to non-audiophiles....and the ease of setup is appreciated by non-technical people. It's a quality product that significantly ups the game in this market segment. It's a winner.UPDATE:  I recently added a HEOS5 speaker to this system.  First, I didn't think it was possible to improve on the sound quality of the HEOS3, but Denon did it.  The form factor of the HEOS5 is larger and allows the Denon engineers more flexibility.  The sound seems much more full than the HEOS3, which itself was no slouch in that department.  I most appreciate the carry handle molded into the HEOS5 - it's nice to have a handy grip with which to carry this speaker.Multiroom setup was very easy - the app takes care of everything.  You use the app to group the speakers and what they will play.  One thing I loved is that when grouped, any input on any speaker will automagically sync across the group.  That means with my gaming rig, I have the Aux input set up on the HEOS5, with the HEOS3 behind me...both speakers played and played darned well.  No synch issues that I could detect.You can also use multiroom to play different songs to each speaker or group.I also plugged in a thumb drive into one of the speakers which showed up under the \"local music\" option on the app menu...and of course all songs are available to the system, whether playing in sync or separate songs on each speaker\/group.I really wish I could give this thing six stars.  Any criticisms I could come up with for this system would, for me, be just for the sake of criticism.  Denon really came up with a strong system here and it works like crazy.","rating":5},{"comment":"THIS REVIEW is for BOTH the HEOS 3 and HEOS 5.....The Denon HEOS line is to 2014 what the Bose Wave Radio was to 2004. A smallish, self contained unit that outputs high fidelity sound. Of course, the Bose only played CD's and OTA Radio.  Times have changed and people expect more. Much more.And MUCH MORE is exactly what you get with the Denon HEOS line-up.I have both the HEOS 3 and HEOS 5 and will review both units, as individual standalones  and as part of a multi HEOS system although both have much in common.Going in, it is very important to realize that the HEOS system is absolutely dependent on external control for both speaker operation and media control. (not counting the included physical volume control) You WILL require either an Android or iOS device to make this work.  You will be required to download the HEOS app and you MUST have a home network, preferably wireless, although you can use the included Ethernet port for a hard wired connection.Making connections with all your external devices, local storage, etc. is accomplished thru the HEOS software. As with all software, there is a learning curve albeit a small one in this case.  In my case I am using a Kindle Fire HD for control and can access my music files from that device plus others on my local network. There is also a USB port for local attached storage so even if you never connect to cloud based music services such as Pandora, you can still play a multitude of music. Choices. You have plenty of choices.Connectivity has been a non issue for me. Once the software updated itself (twice w\/restarts) I was good to go. Our home network is based around the newest Verizon Fios router and we pay for their \"Quantum\" speed.  I have yet to hear any dropped audio, although there IS a slight delay\/lag at times for both responses to playlist changes and volume control messages. It is very minimal but perceptible.I'll tell you what I like and do not like about the HEOS so far.Likes:  Excellent aesthetics, very nicely constructed with premium build quality, sound quality (on the 3) that equals or possibly surpasses the original Bose Wave radio.  Even the HEOS 3 is capable of decent sound levels and for smallish rooms (ie: bathrooms, kitchen, small bedroom, etc.) it is more than sufficient.  For larger bedrooms, family rooms or a large living area I would definitely steer you towards the HEOS 5 or HEOS 7. (more on the HEOS 5 at the bottom of this review)The ability to play a different song in every room is a feature I will probably never use but nice to have if you are having a party and some want to slow dance and others want to rave.  Again, it's all about choices with the HEOS system.If you are using multiple HEOS units throughout the home, the single most important thing you need to worry about is signal latency. In the case of HEOS, it is so low that it is virtually indistinguishable from unit to unit. NO flanging can be heard between units, no digital delay, etc. They are basically synced and rock solid to the naked ear.While the Denon HEOS produces quality sound and in abundance, it is necessary for me to state flat out that these will never replace a full sized sound system, at least not for me. I grew up with large stand along speakers that were connected with wires to an actual stereo amplifier\/pre-amp.  Yes, I am from the stone age. For MOST people though, the HEOS system, especially if you include a model 5 or 7 in the set-up, will be more then enough to rock the house day after day, night after night. The class D amps drive the enclosures to perfection. They ARE loud. They DO rock and most listeners WILL be impressed with these. I admit to being one of them.Also, these run a bit warm, but NOT hot. Included cables are of good quality and I have found nothing overly \"cheap\" about any of it.Dislikes:  So far, the most irritating thing about the HEO for me is the seemingly inability to dim the operation LED. It is too bright for my taste and I would like to dim it or better yet, to turn it OFF.  Hopefully a software upgrade can alleviate this. Wi-Fi only, no Bluetooth.  There are good solid reasons for this, but I would have preferred the option.Home Share files need to be recognized and made usable. Streaming from Amazon requires a direct connection with your phone or device. (unless I am doing something wrong) Also, even though an Aux in jack is provided (and cable as well) you still can't use it without going thru their software. I would prefer being able to use the speaker in standalone mode w\/ no network needed if that was what I wanted to do. No dice!A savvy Amazon member and Vine Voice informed me where the EQ controls are located.Quoting from William Gross: \"In the HEOS app, under \"Music,\" there's a cog icon on the screen. Go in there, pick My Devices, pick the HEOS device, then pick EQ, and there you can adjust the bass\/treble.\"  Thanks very much William!IF I could pick JUST ONE feature I wish could be added, it would be the ability to run the HEOS app from a networked PC. For me, that would be the very best way to use this. My wish for this painfully shows just how \"old school\" I am.In Conclusion:In the end, it is all about the sound! In the case of the Denon HEOS product line, sound quality is a non issue. These sound good. VERY good.  Mids and Highs sparkle on the 3, but the low end is a bit weak. This is to be expected. Again, if you need MORE low end, go with the 5 or 7 model.Alone, or as part of a multi-room system, the Denon HEOS 3 can give you wireless access to your music collection and from most cloud based services. The sound quality is WAY above average for this type of device and the build quality is excellent.  The HEOS 3 is an exceptionally good value and after being a former Bose Wave owner, I can firmly attest to the fact that you get more, MUCH MORE with the Denon HEOS system than Bose has ever offered and for MUCH less money!INFO specific to the HEOS 5 Wireless speaker:The HEOS 5 sits right in the sweet spot between models 3 and 7 in both performance and price.  My system consists of the 3 and 5 so I will note the differences.It's a much larger unit and shaped differently. Sound seems to emanate in an almost 360 degrees pattern. It truly is impressive in action. Build quality is high end as well.Audio quality is much improved with the HEOS 5.  Noticeable stereo separation is apparent when standing\/sitting in the sweet spot right in front of the speaker. Bass response along with overall volume levels are also enhanced greatly. With 2 sets of tweeters and \"Mid-Woofer\" drivers , plus a passive radiator for low frequencies, you are getting a much more well rounded audio delivery system.  You can easily fill a  mid sized room with music with the 5, but it still lacks the thumping low end performance you would get from even a modest dedicated subwoofer, as far as bass response goes. This isn't saying there is no bass. There is, and it is quite pleasing. Just keep your expectations in check and you won't be disappointed.IN a recent announcement, Denon says they will be in introducing a subwoofer to the lineup so those who require more bass will soon be able to get it and all within the wireless HEOS system. That's what I call good thinking! Bassheads can rejoice!Comparing the HEOS 5 to a  Soundbar\/ small Sub combo, this Denon will stand up admirably.  Hands down better than ANY boombox I used to own over the years and better sounding than any mini shelf system I have owned, some of which cost many times more. I feel the unit has power to spare and I could get it's volume level up to the point where it was more than loud enough and still not hear any distortion from the built-in amps or speaker array.Again, it is important to note than when using both the HEOS 3 AND 5 together and playing the same program material, there is no audible latency between the two speakers. The HEOS app will let you decide which speaker you wish to control and what each one should be doing. It sounds more complicated than it is actually. In use, it is not at all difficult to control both speakers for whatever purpose you desire. Whether you have different songs playing on each, or the same on both, the HEOS 3 and 5 (and 7 if you have one) act together as part of a system.As far as quality and product longevity, I can attest to the fact that my Denon AVR is still going strong after 6 years of daily use. I have no reason to believe this product won't last as long.  Denon gives you a nice 2 year warranty on the full range of HEOS components, a very welcome change from the usual 90 days parts and labor stuff that many manufacturers stick you with.Recommended by ME, Marty G !","rating":5},{"comment":"Right out of the box both wireless speakers feels like solid quality hardware. Its' beautiful black design compliments any room. They're not light speakers that you'll want to move around a house (though you can), so finding a place of their own is ideal. We placed ours on a shelf in our living room, and one upstairs in our room. The power cord is not particularly long on the HEOS 3, so you'll need to be sure you have a nearby outlet. Once plugged in the speakers emits a blue bottom backlight that stays on all the time.**Things to know:-- There are only three switches on the speaker: Mute and Volume + and -. They are easy to feel and find in a darkened room.-- You'll need to download the free HEOS by Denon App, which was super easy to find and install both on my iPhone 4 and iPad and took just about a minute to do.-- Launch the app and follow the instructions, which include using the included cord to connect your phone and speaker to complete setup.-- Next it will ask for your wireless password (speaker will glow red if the password or connection is not correct), then you'll name your speaker. There are several preselected names provided: Bathroom, Bedroom, Deck, Den, Foyer, etc., but you can also personalize the name. We names ours \"Downstairs\" and \"Upstairs.\"-- After you get a connection you will get multiple music choices for supplying music to your HOES speakers: Rhapsody, Pandora, Spotify, etc. I selected \"This iPhone\" and got my whole list including playlists. Audiobooks were not included (could get around this by labeling them music in iTunes, but I think this should be an option in the app).-- Had songs playing quickly. The volume was astounding! I've never heard anything that loud and clear in my house before. I turned the sound all the way up and the bass was shaking our house. You can do simple adjustment to the speaker to equalize it (through the app), only treble and bass. Thank goodness because I was hearing a lot of bass on music I didn't know had bass. The HEOS 5 speaker sounded clearer and brighter than the HEOS 3.-- BEST FEATURE: you can pair the speakers and play them together. This is the coolest thing ever! You control both speakers and sound through the app. Together they sound amazing. It's so cool to walk around the house and hear the same song playing through out, and not just loose the sound because you went from upstairs to downstairs. Seriously, this is the most amazing feature! Great for parties. Denon says you can pair 32 speakers. Wow. How much would 32 speakers cost, and why would anyone need that many little speakers? But Denon wants to make sure you're covered.-- The cool factor is that so long as you have a WiFi connection you can select music to play on any or both speakers from anywhere near your house.-- Oh, after playing one song and turning it off, when I turned the app back on it asked for an update. I had to wait about 3 minutes or so. Don't know why they didn't just include the update with the initial application download.Overall these are fantastic speakers. They packs a punch for their size (even just one speaker alone!), which is why we were able to label a speaker \"Downstairs\" and \"upstairs,\" because that's all we need for our townhouse. The speaker is so loud it fills the entire downstairs very clearly on only 1\/3 volume setting. If I turn the volume up I'd become the annoying neighbor whose house will vibrate and pop.**What I did not like:-- Unfortunately it only offers sound for movies on your iPhone or iPad when you plug it in with the audio connector. It's not bluetooth. But the speaker and iPad cords are too short and not in a position to place both side by side to watch clearly. So for us we'd have to move the speaker.-- Also, if your router stops working, so will your speakers.-- Interestingly, when you select a song to play the app creates a queue. So say you go to an album and select a song, and the song ends, it goes onto songs you've previously selected, instead of cycling through the songs in the album. This must be a quirk, right? Why can't I listen to all the songs in the album. You do need to create a HEOS account, but I haven't done it yet. I loath creating accounts for something like this, it makes me suspicious that my music habits are being tracked. HEOS says that an \"account is required to enjoy online music, playlists, and some other features on your system. Your HOES account is used to interact with the Denon proxy server to manage multiple online accounts, enhance response times, save playlists, and save history data. Your email is required to create an account.\"Really loving these speakers, but would have loved it more if I could channel movies through it directly, didn't have to create an account, and it played music through an entire album and not just in a queue. I will add another update when we get a chance to set this up for the TV Audio.NOTE: If you're having trouble \"grouping\" your spears together make sure both have been updated in the app. I had the HEOS 3 updated, but not the HOES 5 and it wouldn't \"group.\" I went online to find a solution but Denon didn't have that under their \"Support\" section. It was kind of frustrating at first. I even rebooted my phone. Anyway, once you do the update on *both* speakers it should work.","rating":4},{"comment":"Denon makes a bold entry to the world of wireless synced, networked speakers with their new HEOS sound-system line. Priced to compete against the likes of Sonos these are premium networked audio components that easily set up right out of the box and truly delivers with punchy and detailed sound that defies its compact sizing. The only qualm I have at the time of product launch (release date = August 1, 2014) is the lack of certain features within its interface and a limited selection of music source options, however, via product rep inquiries I have been assured that this ecosystem will continuously evolve over time.Below following are my highlights and considerations on key functional elements of the system. This review is based on Denon's entry level `HEOS 3' wireless speaker controlled through an iPhone 5s and iPad. This review will be updated as additional HEOS components are added to the mix.SOUND QUALITY, 5 stars*For a small package (weighs in at approximately 7 lbs) the speaker delivers a bright and robust sound that retains high-low clarity even at high volume levels. Compared to other similar wireless\/bluetooth speakers that I've used (Sonos 1 & 3 and Bose's Soundlink speaker) the HEOS wins this battle easily and it really shouldn't come as a surprise as Denon is known for its audiophile grade components and on that front their practical expertise really comes to shine.*Volume output is very powerful even at 50% of speaker volume*There are very simple EQ settings for bass and treble only. Default levels are set at 50%. Setting bass at about 60% was just right for my tastes and the positioning of the speaker. Bass is beefy and smooth and almost sounds as if there should be an aux subwoofer tucked somewhere out of sight.SETUP, 5 stars*Very simple process - should take no more than 5-10 minutes.  The kit comes with everything you'd need (a cat5 cable for those that prefer wired over ethernet and an aux cable to hookup with your device controller i.e. smartphone).*The only other things you'll need are an iOs\/Android device (the only way to control the system) and password to your wifi network.MUSIC SOURCES, 3 stars*Sadly your audio source options are quite limited especially when compared to the Sonos ecosystem. At the time of launch the HEOS will stream audio from Pandora, Spotify, Rhapsody and tunein radio. Not having the likes of Amazon Music or Beats Music are some of the more glaring omissions in my opinion.*Another mild irritation is that to utilize the 'free' version of Spotify you will need to be a paid premium member of its service in order to utilize the 'Connect' feature and stream through HEOS (free versions of Pandora and tunein work fine, haven't tried Rhapsody).*You can also use the aux cable to connect other devices to play through the HEOS and while this works fine it really defeats the purpose of utilizing a networked audio system. Having a bluetooth stream option to allow all audio on your device (eg - Youtube, games, etc) to output through HEOS would've been a nice alternative option and is sadly missing.*There is also a USB input that allows thumb and external drives filled with MP3's to play through the system. This works ok but it will take a few minutes (or more) for HEOS to index all the files the first time you plug in.NETWORK FUNCTIONALITY, 5 stars*The HEOS functions through your wifi network and with built in dual bad wifi (802.11a\/b\/g\/n standard on 2.4GHz and 5Ghz bands) the speaker retains excellent stability (no pops, stutters, dropouts) even with my speaker positioned in my bedroom upstairs from my router. Any home with a modern router and decent connection should have no issues getting this system operational.*Interestingly - HEOS can support up to 32 speakers on its network at once!APP CONTROLLER, 4 stars*Overall the App is simple and well thought out in terms of UI. It is easy to switch between your various audio sources, create playlists and sync up additional HEOS speakers to your network.*However, a few missing features stood out to me. A lack of shuffle play option and no audio controls on the iOs lock screens were somewhat glaring.*One very convenient feature of the HEOS network is that once your speaker(s) and device are synced up you can enable other devices to instantly access and control the speakers and music sources so long as the app is installed and the device is running on the same wifi network. This may cause problems if you have kids\/roommates\/significant others who might want to take over DJ duties and ruin your vibe but for the sake of sheer convenience in enabling multiple devices this really can't be beat.HEOS 3 FORM FACTOR SPECIFIC, 4 stars*If you like to sleep in a darkened room - this speaker is not bedroom friendly. Because this speaker is always `on' with no way to turn it off save for unplugging it there is a vibrant blue light that is emitted at all times. In a dark room this light is bright and noticeable so to alleviate I wrap a t-shirt around the speaker's base at night.*The design of the speaker exudes class and quality. There is nothing cheap about the build quality and finish. The speaker can also be positioned horizontally\/vertically, however the `on' lighting is even brighter when the speaker is set in a horizontal position.*There is also a threaded hole for wall mounting.","rating":4},{"comment":"I got the Denon HEOS 3 and HEOS 5 for my dining room and kitchen. Unlike other cellphone speakers that I've purchased which are essentially docks, these are wireless speakers controlled nearly entirely by the phone. Both speakers are impressive out of the box, with very nice packaging and accessories (top-quality 3.5mm and Ethernet cables). Setup on both was simple, starting with downloading the Denon HEOS app to my smartphone. The app then takes you step by step through the setup process, connecting the 3.5mm cable to the phone and speaker and logging into my wifi network. It took only a couple of minutes before I was playing music from my phone.Sound quality is outstanding for a single speaker, each on their own. The HEOS 5, which is larger and offers a bit more bass over the HEOS 3, but more noticeable is the incredibly crisp highs... the HEOS 5 sounds incredibly sharp. The HEOS 3 is a bit of a step down in sound quality from the HEOS 5, but is still better then any other phone speaker system I've ever used. Even using just one as a single speaker, the sound fills the room thoroughly.The sound quality is really the only thing that separates the HEOS 3 and 5. The HEOS 5 offers no additional controls or features, although the HEOS 3 can be placed horizontally or vertically, and includes a screw hole on the back for wall mounting.Aside from the option to mute and turn the volume up or down on the speaker itself, the speakers are controlled entirely by the smartphone app. The app works quite well, with three main menu options. First is the 'Rooms' tab, which shows the list of HEOS speakers in your home, which in my case shows the HEOS 5 as 'Kitchen' and HEOS 3 as 'Dining Room', along with what's playing on each. Click on the appropriate speaker to change what's being played on them, or drag and drop one speaker on to another to group them to play the same thing. You can also set each speaker as a 'left' or 'right' for stereo sound.The next tab is 'Music' which allows you to select what to play on the selected speaker. The list includes Pandora, Spotify, Tunein, Rhapsody, as well as music from the phone itself. You can also select playlists or tell the speaker to play from the 3.5mm aux input on the speaker itself.The last tab is 'Now Playing', which shows what's being played on the selected speaker. Here you can skip, pause, or adjust the volume. Speakers that have been grouped on the 'Rooms' tab can have their volumes adjusted independently. In addition, there's a configuration menu to allow treble and bass adjustments for each speaker.The app works quite well, much better then I had expected. I'm not a big fan of app-controlled devices, but this one works nearly perfectly. There is no delay when inputting commands and the control I have over the speakers is perfect. My wife can turn the speakers on from her phone and I can see what's playing from mine and make changes.Overall, I'm very impressed by Denon's HEOS speakers. No complaints at all on the speakers themselves. As for the app, only one complaint... occasionally the app crashes, which seems to happen more often during start up. It's pretty rare, even for how much I use the system, so it's not a big deal. HEOS is new right now, so there will probably be a few wrinkles to iron out. Aside from that, the system is flawless and I plan to add at least one more HEOS speaker.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have both the HEOS 3 and the HEOS 5.  I have the 3 in my bedroom and the 5 in my living room.Getting Started - Both of these speakers were packaged very well and were easy to unpack and get started.  Both speakers come with a Quick Start guide that will get you up and running in just a few simple, easy-to-follow steps.  Basically you just plug in your speaker, download the HEOS by Denon app and you're ready to to get started.  One thing that disappointed me though was the fact that there's no actual user manual.  Aside from the simple little quick start guide, there was nothing else to refer to.  I had a few questions that I just had to figure out on my own.  There's not manual to refer to.Setup - After installing the app on my iPad and opening it up, it walked me through the setup process to add my speakers.  It was pretty simple for the most part.  I did have a tiny snag with the HEOS 5 when it had me plug my iPad into the speaker via the audio cable.  It tells you that when the light turns yellow you are to push the connect button.  My light never turned yellow.  I ended up pushing connect anyway and it connected just fine.  I got the yellow light with the HEOS 3 and it connected just fine as well.During the setup process you give each of your speakers a name, which is the name of the room that you have your device in.  So basically my speakers are name \"Bedroom\" and \"Living Room\".  This is how you choose which device you're wanting to use and what you want to do with it.The App - I really like the HEOS by Denon app.  There are several music options.  Pandora, Spotify, tunein, Rhapsody and you device's music.  I love using Pandora and I also love using tunein to listen to my local radio stations.  The app will also keep a history log for you so you're able to quickly and easily select the track or station again.  From the app you're able to rename your speakers, access the EQ settings where you can change the treble and\/or bass as desired, check for updates, add another device and much more.Playing Music - From the app you have 3 main tabs across the bottom of your screen.  Rooms, Music & Now Playing.  You select room to pick which speaker\/room you want to play music in.  You go back and fourth easily so that you're able to play different things on different speakers.  Or, if you want you can play your music on both speakers simultaneously.  This is nice if you're the only one home and are doing housework.  My living room is downstairs and my bedroom is upstairs so I'm able to hear the music pretty much wherever I'm at.  It was a bit tricky figuring out how to group my speakers together so I could play the same thing on both at the same time.  The app tells you to \"Drag one room into another to group them\".  I kept putting my finger on one and dragging it to the other but all they would do would be to switch positions.  I finally discovered that you have to actually hold your finger on one of the rooms for a second or two prior to dragging it to the other.  Then, they were grouped together and would play the same thing.  Every now and then they will play a bit out of sync but when I skip to the next song it seems to correct itself.The Speakers - The speakers themselves look pretty nice.  The shape of them is unique but to be honest these aren't ones that would really catch my eye if I saw them in somebody else's house.  They're just not very sharp looking or and don't have anything that gives it the wow factor.  They're not bad looking, they just don't stand out.Aside from the plug-in's on the back the only other buttons on the speakers is a volume up, volume down and a mute button.  There's not even a power button.  The speakers just kinda go on stand-by and always have a blue light on indicating that it's plugged in.  This is kinda nice in the sense that you can pick up your music device at any given time and start playing music.  On the other hand, I wonder how much power it's using sitting on stand-by all the time.The HEOS 5 has a handle which is helpful for carrying.  The HEOS 3 can stand vertically like a tower or it can lay down horizontally.Sound - Over the past 7 years or so I've probably tried at least 10 different speakers.  I think the sound is really great from these speakers.  They'e both really powerful.  The HEOS 3 didn't sound as great when I was testing it out in my dining room which is very open to the rest of the downstairs.  When I put it in my bedroom I was able to hear that it's just as good as the HEOS 5.  It just sounds best in a smaller space, which is what it was designed for.  I have no complaints with the sound.  I'd say they're one of the best sounding speakers that I've used.Multiple Users - After installing the app on my iPad and figuring everything out, I had my husband put the app on his iPad as well.  As soon as he installed the app, both speakers appeared on his app immediately.  He was able to set up his own HEOS account which then allowed him to log-in to his own Pandora and other music accounts so that he could choose his own personalized music.  I can set my daughter and son up with their own accounts too.  I think having the ability to do this will come in very handy in our house.  It's nice not having to stick to just one single device.Overall, I'm quite pleased with both of these speakers.  I would highly recommend them.","rating":5},{"comment":"I finally feel like I'm somewhat on par with my Sonos music friends... :)  I received the Denon HEOS 3 and HEOS 5 wireless speakers from the Amazon Vine review program, and this is an item that I've been anxiously awaiting. After using it for a few days, I am very impressed with the ease of use and sound quality that the HEOS speakers offer. Setup was a breeze, and I'm actually starting to listen to music again during the day while I work.I expected to encounter some level of pain trying to connect the speakers to my wireless network... not because I have a strange network, but just because those things don't seem to work very intuitively. Much to my surprise, it was close to plug-and-play. I downloaded the HEOS app to my iPhone and unboxed the speakers. Side note on the packaging... high quality and classy packaging... it speaks volumes (a slight pun intended) for what's inside. Set-up involved plugging the speaker into a power outlet, plugging a small cable into the speaker and my iPhone, and pressing the Connect button on the back of my speaker. The iPhone app takes it from there. Both my speakers connected in less than 30 seconds and were listed as separate speakers on my device list. They also updated the software automatically and &#34;rebooted&#34; each speaker. At that point, I had a HEOS sound system!The sound quality is exceptional (to my admittedly non-audophile ears). The bass and treble ranges are excellent, and even at louder volumes there's no distortion. The HEOS 5 (the larger of the two speakers) does have a richer sound, but not by much over the HEOS 3. I have the HEOS 5 down in my mancave office where I can crank it a bit, and the HEOS 3 is up in my wife's sewing room. She loves having something better than her tinny PC speaker now. Even though I have a decent sound system hooked up to my PC, I'm enjoying the HEOS sound more (and liking that my computer isn't running my music programs).The HEOS app is, in my opinion, pretty easy to work with. I set up the speakers using my iPhone, but I wasn't sure what I would get when it came time to set up the app on my iPad and wife's iPhone (and an older one at that). No worries... she downloaded the application, started it up, and it automagically found both speakers on the network with no prompting or searching. She was playing music from her iPhone in less than five minutes after downloading the app. Any time I don't have to play computer or iPhone tech support, I'm happy.Based on my (again, admittedly more limited than some of my friends) music sources, I was pleased with the options for streaming to the HEOS system. The iPhone app recognizes Pandora, Spotify, Tunein, Rhapsody, and the actual iPhone\/iPad. I have my limited music collection on iTunes (and sync'd with my iPhone), so I was happy to play from there to the HEOS. I sort of &#34;rediscovered&#34; Pandora over the last few days, too. I've been enjoying putting it on one of the &#34;radio station&#34; channels I had in my Pandora account, and just letting it play over the HEOS. Over time, I'd like to see more music sources be available, but for my typical usage, this is a good selection.My friends are always raving about their Sonos systems and how they can have different music playing in different rooms controlled by different people. I used to think &#34;so what?&#34; as it wasn't that important to me. Now having played with the HEOS system, I &#34;get it&#34; and will forever be spoiled by not having to listen to music via headphones or less-than-wonderful speakers. I'll also be spoiled knowing that I can move my speakers around to any room if needed, and I can create ambience wherever I'm at in the house.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment: Free","rating":5},{"comment":"The first part of this review is for iPhone 5S + HEOS 3 functionality. The second part (at bottom) is for iPhone 5S + HEOS 5 functionality, and then HEOS 3 + HEOS 5 as a system.The HEOS system is Denon's \"answer\" to all the iOS AirPlay systems out there, but with some love shown to Android users, too. The problem, right off the bat, is that by catering to both iOS and Android, Denon have surprisingly over-complicated some things, and completely (at least for now) omitted others.Opening this HEOS 3 is a joy. One piece of easily-removed foam from the top, and out pops the speaker. There was no squeezing hands in around pieces of packaging trying to wiggle any parts out. It's good to see Denon paying attention to the actual product packaging, as it definitely exudes quality.With the speaker out of the box, it's a simple case of plugging it in. You'll need to download the free HEOS app from the Google Play store, or from the Apple App Store. The HEOS app will run you through a very simple setup process to get the HEOS speaker to connect to your home network. For reference, I had no trouble connecting the HEOS to either the 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz bands on my 2013 Apple Time Capsule.A firmware update was available at the time of writing, so I ran that. It took just a minute or two, and then the speaker went into a reboot process and reconnected to my 5Ghz network without issue.At this point, I logged in to my Pandora Radio account through the HEOS app, and was able to view my stations and add new ones with ease. Playing music, artwork, skipping songs etc works just great.I prefer the sound of the HEOS 3 with the speaker set in the horizontal position. NOTE: The speaker's software is set up for it to be used vertically out of the box, so if horizontal positioning works better for you, be sure to change the speaker orientation in the setup menu of the HEOS app.Unfortunately, there's no way to use iTunes Home Sharing, or iTunes Radio with the HEOS system as of July, 2014. This is a rather frustrating omission. Currently, the only options for music are: Pandora, Spotify, tunein, Rhapsody, - and what's actually on your iPhone. In addition, you can use the auxiliary input on the speaker to output any audio from any source that has a 3.5mm headphone jack, but then of course you're constrained by a wire...Audio quality is excellent. The HEOS 3, being the smallest of the HEOS line, is probably best in a smaller room, but it puts out a clean sound as long as you don't push the volume levels to their max. Bass isn't great (I get fuller bass from my Jawbone Big Jambox) even when pushed to the max bass level in the HEOS app, but that's expected from a speaker of this size. The higher end of the audio spectrum is handled beautifully, with clean treble. Hayley Westenra sounds lovely on the HEOS 3, though to be fair - Hayley Westenra would sound wonderful on a potato.Pros:1.) Works similarly to Google Chromecast, where it actually hands off e.g. Pandora to the device. So you start the HEOS app, and then Pandora Radio from your iPhone. After the music starts playing on the HEOS, you can switch your phone off because the HEOS has taken over at this point. This is actually a good way of doing things, because it rules out a device. With AirPlay from your phone to another wireless speaker, you have the phone communicating with the Internet to get the music, while continually handing off that music to the wireless speaker. This means two devices have to work together at all times, wirelessly. You'll see more audio drops due to interference etc this way, so Denon solves that problem to a greater degree.The benefit to HEOS app over AirPlay, is that currently iOS devices can not AirPlay to more than one device at a time. With your Mac computer, in iTunes, you can output music etc to multiple speakers over AirPlay, but you can't from your iPhone or iPad. The HEOS app solves that issue with its own app.But... (see cons...)2.) Audio quality is clean and crisp. Sound is very, very subjective, but I like what I hear, especially given the HEOS 3's fairly diminutive size.3.) Comes with a mounting screw-hole for wall mounting.Cons:1.) Because it's not AirPlay-capable, adjusting volume on the HEOS isn't as simple as just hitting the volume up\/down button even while your iPhone's screen is off (like you can do in AirPlay). To adjust the volume, you need to unlock your phone, be in the HEOS app, and then you can use the volume up\/down on your iPhone. You can do this on the speaker itself, but either way it's just not *quite* as convenient as I'd like.2.) Some slightly flakey software. I've had a few occasions where waking up my phone to get back into the HEOS app while a song is playing has resulted in the HEOS software deciding to play a completely different song from a completely different album on my phone. Wait... what?3.) The bottom of the HEOS 3 speaker (in portrait mode) is a travesty of design. There's a large, shower-curtain-grey thick rubber strip that goes around the entire bottom, clearly designed to stop the speaker sliding or getting knocked over too easily. The downside is that it's really, really ugly in landscape mode. Not only that, but this rubber strip houses a giant blue LED. I took a tape measure, and the LED light, including light bleed\/leakage into the rubber strip, is about two inches in length. TWO inches! You know it's not a good sign when you can use the LED from an electronic device as a reading lamp. Yes, I tested this, and yes, you can read a book in the dark when sitting close to the HEOS 3 speaker. It's admittedly not AS obnoxious when the speaker is in vertical orientation, but since the speaker is designed to sit in either direction, it's just a shame that the left side of the speaker is so unsightly when positioned landscape.What's worse, is that this blue light is on 100% of the time. Whether playing music or sitting idle, that blue light will be ON. If you don't like bright, blue LEDs as I don't, be prepare to get creative, somehow. As it is, bedroom use is reserved only for the less sensitive among us.Interestingly, the product picture of the left side (in landscape) on Amazon shows what appears to be a black strip around the speaker, but it's absolutely not when you receive the product.Denon: Please implement an option to dim\/disable this LED.4.) No (current) support for iTunes, iTunes Radio, Amazon music, Google Play etc. I really hope this gets resolved, because this is a big one.Overall, this is a good effort from Denon. I'm not sure it's quite there in terms of software, and some hardware design is just bewildering, but I suspect this is a product line that will evolve pretty quickly as more users get their hands on them and Denon receives feedback. Hopefully someone at the HEOS team is listening!3.75 stars out of 5.-----HEOS 5 review:Unpacking the HEOS 5 is similar to the HEOS 3, in a good way. A simple unpacking experience really puts me in a good mood, so I expected good things.For the HEOS 5 vs HEOS 3, things are MUCH improved. Quite frankly you should skip the HEOS 3 unless you NEED wall-mounting ability or the additional size of the HEOS 5 doesn't work for you (or the increased cost, of course). The HEOS 5 is in a different league of audio output compared to the HEOS 3. As my wife put it, \"there's just so much more there.\" Separation of channels is more apparent, bass is much more there (the whole speaker vibrates - in a good way!), and it feels like an actual speaker \"system\" vs just a lone speaker as the HEOS 3 comes across as.Sadly, Big Blue LED makes a return in the HEOS 5, though because the HEOS 5 sits in just one orientation it's marginally less unpleasant on the eyes, always along the bottom of the speaker (though still too much).In terms of setting the speaker up, it's exactly the same procedure as the HEOS 3, which is to say - it takes but a moment.After having to update the firmware on the HEOS 3 out of the box, I figured I'd immediately check for an update for the HEOS 5. Denon's HEOS software told me there wasn't one. However, after trying (unsuccessfully) to \"move\" the HEOS 3 and the HEOS 5 together in the software, the app told me there was an update available. OK then. The firmware update ran and the HEOS 5 updated (indicated by a flashing yellow light while downloading the firmware, and a flashing blue light while installing the firmware).After the update, I was able to move the HEOS 3 and 5 in software into the same \"room,\" so I could test this functionality.For the HEOS 5 speaker by itself, 4.5 stars out of 5. A noticeably better product than the HEOS 3, and certainly worth the additional cost.-----HEOS 5 + HEOS 3 System:Denon have the right idea, here. Surprisingly, the HEOS 3 and HEOS 5 work quite well together, even in the same room. There's zero perceptible latency when streaming music to both speakers at the same time. I even placed the speakers right next to each other and - no question - perfectly synced music. I was even more surprised to here that the HEOS 3 and 5 actually play well together in the same room, as long the volumes are leveled (which you can do independently in the HEOS app). The good thing here is that e.g. level 34 on the HEOS 3 is the \"same\" as level 34 HEOS 5, so volume leveling is easy.\"Separating\" the speakers from each other in their virtual room, I was able to play Pandora radio to one HEOS speaker, while playing some music from my iPhone on the other. It's easy to switch between speakers and make adjustments to volume etc. Great stuff.However, the bugs that are in the software just feel slightly more readily apparent when you have multiple HEOS speakers involved. I ran into a peculiar one where I was unable to adjust the EQ for the HEOS 5 when both the HEOS 3 and 5 were playing. The treble and bass settings were adjustable, but had no actual effect on the audio being played. A combination of rebooting the speaker and closing\/reopening the software solved it, but it's cropped up on numerous occasions now as to convince me it's not just a one-off bug. I'd say set your treble and bass and leave it, at least until Denon (hopefully) issue some updates.Overall, as a system, the foundation is there. There's a consistency between the HEOS 3 and HEOS 5 here that I really like, but I'd really like to see some maturity of software (and support of more music apps), along with the aforementioned ability to disable those LEDs...As a \"system\", the Denon HEOS receives a 4 out of 5. Bring on the software updates!","rating":4},{"comment":"I set this up using a cheap Android-based LePan II tablet that uses Ice Cream Sandwich-no problems at all with the app installation. You can set this up one of two ways: by pushing your router's WPS button and then pushing the connect button on the back of the speaker, or by manually entering your router's password using the 3.5mm cable running from the speaker to your phone\/tablet.HEOS 3: More than adequate for a 13 x 15 bedroom. This sounds best placed horizontally, but I'm considering ordering another HEOS 3 and making a left\/right speaker set-up. There is a threaded mounting hole in the back of this speaker so you can mount this model to a bracket.HEOS 5: Used in a great room\/dining area\/kitchen area open space, roughly 17 x 17, 12 x 12 and a galley kitchen 10 x 12 feet. This has richer, deeper bass than the HEOS 3, more powerful sound overall but even when I change the treble setting for this speaker, I don't hear the crispness I get from the HEOS 3.My opinion of the two speakers is different than most. I prefer the HEOS 3 over the 5 since this speaker can be configured as both L+R, left speaker or right speaker for better separation. You can't do that with the HEOS 5, it's both L+R combined into one. I like the clean crisp sound I get from the HEOS 3 as opposed to the punchy bass the HEOS 5 puts out.You can change the bass & treble settings only for both speakers. I wish there was a graphic equalizer setting where you can auto-set it to the type of music being played, such as rock, soul, techno, jazz, country, etc. like many systems have.Combining both speakers to play the same songs is easy, just drag hold for a second or two and what really impresses me is the sound syncs perfectly. My condo isn't large enough to get away with playing different music in various locations.Not a lot to dislike...I wish the speakers had standard electrical plugs instead of large bricks. OTOH, I like being able to shut my tablet down after choosing my Pandora playlist, however, I can't thumbs-up\/thumbs-down the music selections then. As far as buffering or breaking-up, no problems so far, even when streaming Netflix in another room and being on the phone-I use MagicJack for my \"landline\". (I have Comcast 25 Mpbs internet).I had never heard of Tunein before using the HEOS system. It's quickly becoming my favorite over Pandora, giving me access to hundreds of radio stations all over the world. And you don't have to set up an account to use it.CONCLUSION: While I like these, I think the development is in the early-stage. Where is Amazon cloud streaming? Where is streaming via my NAS? I think the speakers are a little overpriced. For the past year I've been streaming music thru a Denon CEOL system with conventional wired speakers which were cheaper but they don't sound much different than these.","rating":4},{"comment":"These pieces of F'ing S are all over eBay.

The two satellite speakers with 1-3\/4-inch drivers measure 5-1\/2 inches tall, 3-1\/8 inches wide, and 3 inches deep. The 4-inch downward firing subwoofer is housed in a 5-1\/8 inch wide x 7-5\/8 inch deep x 7-1\/4 inch tall sound box.  The entire system can fit into a small book shelf with an 11-1\/2 inch x 7-5\/8 inch footprint. There is a small control box with a volume adjust wheel, an On-Off switch, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.  Music is input via a 3.5mm plug.  The speaker system is AC-powered; no battery is necessary.The sound is very good for a speaker system in this price range.  There is plenty of volume for personal use in a small room.  The subwoofer adds depth to the music.  The bass can be adjusted from minimum to maximum via a small knob in the back of the subwoofer housing. I can hear the drums in Basil Poledouris's Conan the Barbarian soundtracks in rich detail.  This Logitech multimedia speaker system is worth the money.","rating":5},{"comment":"I was very disappointed with these speakers. They are decent for the price, but spend an extra twenty dollars and you'll get a much better sound experience. Of all the smaller desktop speakers I own (I have about 5 sets) this one was the worst sounding, unfortunately! I have an older pair of Logitech that were $20 more at the time of purchase that my daughter agreed sounded far better. We didn't even realize how much these speakers were lacking in richness of sound, until we plugged in the other set and were shocked at the difference in sound quality.For a spare bedroom you are putting an old computer and speakers in, or a young child just wanting to play computer games, these might be good. If you are looking to listen to music, these will fall short of the sound quality you could have by paying just a little more money.","rating":3},{"comment":"These have decently respectable sound for the price.  I use them in my home office to jam out while I work and they suit my office perfectly.  The bass seems like it should be a bit more powerful given the dedicated sub woofer, but it seems a tad unbalanced.  This set lacks extreme clarity and precision, but what do you expect for $30?  Also, they don't get terribly loud if you are looking for speakers to blare music through or serve as an entertainment source but they are plenty loud for \"casual listening.\"As for build quality, they seem like they will last a bit.  Like the other reviewer, I too have a set of the Cyber Acoustics speakers and feel that these are much higher quality.  It's a trade-off.  A little less performance, a lot more quality.  Presented with both and knowing that I don't use this as a powerful, dedicated audio system, I'd recommend these over the Cyber Acoustics set.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have a similar set of speakers to compare these to: theCyber Acoustics Subwoofer Satellite System (CA-3602a), which is roughly in the same price range.These budget Logitech speakers don't sound as good. The subwoofer isn't as substantial, and these sound a bit less clear. I think the acoustic term is \"muddy\". A bit of humming static in the background as well while playing (not a lot, but noticeable if you have an ear for those things).That said, the build quality on those Cyber Acoustics is terrible. When they work, they sound incredible, but many of them (including mine) have bad wiring, so unless you're comfortable rewiring\/soldering a new plug (the most common best fix for them), I'm not 100% sure you want those either. If you get a good copy though, they sound noticeably better than these Logitechs, for about the same price.I also have (and can strongly recommend) theCreative T30 Wireless Bluetooth 3.0, 2.0 Computer Speaker System with Near Field Communication, but they cost significantly more. They sound great though, even without a subwoofer.Finally, if you need something super portable, I've been super impressed with myAltec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker. For the price and size, it's the most amazing portable speaker I've tried. Much better sound and volume than other tiny speakers.One consideration: You can't use these Logitech speakers without having them plugged directly into the subwoofer. While the plug on the two main speakers will fit into the computer's audio port directly, they need the amplifier in the subwoofer to play at any significant volume. And I do wish the cables were a couple feet longer. They work on my desk setup, but it would be nice to be able to space them apart just a bit more. Wires on the Cyber Acoustics set above are noticeably longer and offer better configuration options.Anyway, there are a few other options to consider. Still, these aren't bad speakers, and are a decent choice for a desktop computer, or something similar. You could do a lot worse. Audiophiles will want something better though.","rating":4},{"comment":"I have a 25&#34; HP Touchsmart PC that I use as my bedroom TV, and the only drawback was that the built in speakers just aren't able to produce enough volume for many programs (and when they do, they are often distorted by the volume).  I've tried other computer speakers with mixed results, but now my problem is solved.  I know we aren't talking Bose quality sound, but these speakers allow me sufficient volume with excellent clarity.  The subwoofer is unusually powerful for something so small.  Fortunately, the subwoofer is adjustable, since it was rattling the TV cabinet at full setting!  With the subwoofer set to 50%, TV shows are perfectly clear and music is outstanding!  I only wish I had gotten these sooner.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have an Altec speaker system that I use for my PC. I love it, but it wasn't cheap.This Logitech system comes close in sound, and it's got a great price. In comparing the two, the Altec comes out slightly ahead, mainly because it has a fuller sound. The Altec also feels heavier and the materials are higher quality.I know the Logitech has the bass control on the back of the subwoofer, but even adjusting it did not produce quite the same range as the Altec. Also, I'm not thrilled that the control is in the back. My desk space is cramped and having to fuss around with something on the back is aggravating. I guess they figured it'd mess with the aesthetics to put the control on the front.So I'm keeping the Altec for the PC, but this Logitech works pretty well with my Sony tablet. Since the speaker system is lighter, it makes it more portable.If you don't want to break the bank, the Logitech will work unless you're a sound snob.","rating":4},{"comment":"If you are looking for value in terms of sound quality from desktop speakers versus cost, then the Logitech Z213 speakers deliver.  Over the years, I have tried speakers from several speaker companies for my computers and I have always returned to Logitech.  I use the speakers with my laptop as well as my iPod.  The sound quality of these speakers is very good, but not amazing.  However, you really cant expect more at this price.  The highs are not very bright and I would certainly say that the speakers tend to emphasis the low frequencies.  This is especially true with the option of producing a lot of bass from the subwoofer.  You can control the amount of bass using a knob on the subwoofer.  I rarely have the woofer turned up very far on a day to day basis because the subwoofer can really deliver to the point of being excessive.  But, the offer of a lot of bass is very nice if you are playing games or watching movies.The two speakers are small enough to sit on a desktop without claiming a lot of space.  The speakers are angled so that the drivers can be directed toward the ears of someone sitting at the desk.  I have the subwoofer sitting under the desk.  A cable runs from the port on my computer to the control pod which sits on my desktop and then to the speakers.  The control pod allows you to control the volume and to turn the speakers off without having to find the power switch on the subwoofer like some other models.  And a nice feature if you wear headphones at times is that there is a 3.5mm-compatible headphone jack on the control pod.  The port is convenient if you have a desktop which is under your desk.Overall, the Logitech Z213 multimedia speakers are good value for the cost.","rating":5},{"comment":"*these were tested using my iMac and Sony headphones.*The Logitech Z213 speakers are a welcome addition to my desktop.  They're replacing a six-year old set of Logitech's that had a subwoofer and left speaker that was spotty at best (the the sound was fine when using them though headphones, however).Out of the box, the Z213's were a breeze to set up.  I simply plugged in the power supply and the jack to the back of my iMac and voila, up and running.The biggest difference between these and my last set is the volume\/headphone jack box.  I could control the volume and plug in the headphone jack straight into one of the satellite speakers.  That created fewer wires and less hassle, in my opinion.  The Z213 has an extra cord to control volume - a set up that works well for my bedroom speakers, but I prefer the jack straight into the speaker for my desktop set.  It's simply a matter of preference, though.The speakers are nicely designed, look just fine next to my silver\/black iMac and sound terrific.  A  nice feature is the adjustable bass levels on the back of the subwoofer.

It is pretty clearly aimed at those who want a modest, budget enhancement for gaming, whereas I am a music fan.  The speaker set basically exists for the primary purpose of having a small, unobtrusive subwoofer.  However, the main speakers are not exactly audiophile equipment, so what you really get with this set is the ability to crank up the bass a bit so that there is a modest rumble with those explosions in games.  For music, the sound is only a modest improvement on the built-in speakers on my iMac desktop.  Frankly, I have no desire to crank up the bass while listening to Miles Davis, so without good treble, these speakers are not for me.  The other limiting factor to keep in mind is that the cables are rather short, meaning you won't have many options for speaker placement.  They are just long enough to keep the subwoofer at your feet underneath the desk with the main speakers to either side of your monitor.  For music, speaker placement matters far more, so you need to have longer cables.Is this for you?  That depends.  If you want a good listening experience for music, sorry, but you'll have to shell out more money.  If you just want a cheap set with a subwoofer for those games, then I suppose these might do, but don't expect miracles.","rating":3},{"comment":"These speakers got their initial trial at a party my son held with many, many teenage boys.

I like its compact size, elegant design, and, almost more than anything else, the feel of its keys while typing. They provide the exact amount of tactile feedback that I like, and I almost don't like typing with any other keyboard. However, one of the shortcomings of this keyboard is the lack of separate numerical keypad that used to be the staple of most computer keyboards for as long as the personal computers have been around. Granted, I don't enter significant amount of numerical data any more, but every once in a while when I need to do some quick calculations I miss the actual separate numerical keypad. For the past year or so I had coopted the trackpad to do the job of a numerical keypad with the use of Mobee Technology Magic Numpad. However, this setup is far from ideal - I don't have the tactile feedback that I am so used to, and the surface of my trackpad has become decidedly less smooth and responsive. All of these shortcoming are the major reason why I am still interested in having an actual physical keypad, and this Satechi keypad seems to fit the bill.The Satechi keypad is very clearly designed to look like the Apple's keyboard and trackpad peripherals. However, unlike the Apple peripherals, it is not made out of aluminum but rather out of plastic. If you are just casually glancing at your work area desk you would not notice this difference though, but once you start typing the similarity disappears. The action of the keys is also softer than that of the Apple's keyboard.The setup was very straightforward. This is plug-and-play USB keypad, and plugging it into one of the available USB ports is all that's needed for it to be recognized by an Apple computer. The keypad is compatible with both the Mac computers as well as the Windows machines. It might also be compatible with some tablets and Linux computers, but I have not tested it with either one of those.This keypad is fairly rudimentary and I would have liked for it to include a few additional keys. They page navigation keys would have been nice, as well as a separate key for launching the calculator app on your computer. Even better would have been an inclusion of programmable keys. This would have made this keypad a very powerful tool in more sophisticated spreadsheet manipulations, advanced scientific calculations, or even as a gaming keypad.This is a really good product, and a welcome addition to my workspace. However, I think it's a bit on a pricey side. A price point that is $5 -$10 less than the current $20 on Amazon would make this keypad much more appealing to the general casual users. Furthermore, these days I am not too keen on wired peripherals, and much prefer to use the wireless ones whenever possible. Satechi makes another similar Bluetooth keypad as well and I would recommend that you check it out if you are more inclined towards wireless devices.**** Product sample provided for review purposes. ****","rating":4},{"comment":"Very nicely designed.

For example. someone using Excel or Numbers might find this will increase their productivity.The one issue I saw with the design of the wired keypad in their attempt to match the Apple bluetooth wireless keyboard is that this is thicker with a white bottom, whereas the Apple keyboard is thin at the portion which slants down. For those who care about this keypad matching the keyboard, this might be something to consider. If what I said was unclear, look at the stock pictures on the Amazon product page above to get a better idea of the white portion beneath the aluminum.Overall, I&#8217;m impressed by the design and functionality of the aluminum wired keypad by Satechi. It&#8217;s a great solution to those who have the Apple Bluetooth keyboard, or a MacBook, and want a keypad that will increase their productivity while looking right at home along with their Apple products. Apart from the white beneath the aluminum that detracted from matching the Apple keyboard, I couldn&#8217;t find any flaws with this product.I was provided with this item as a sample in exchange for my fair and honest evaluation.

Two of them are 2.4 Amp high powered ports for charging power hungry devices like an iPad or many of the larger tablets. Then it has two lower powered 1 Amp USB ports for charging devices like a cell phone or smaller tablets like a kindle. Some wall chargers advertise four ports but fail to inform you that you can't charge on all four ports at the same time without sacrificing speed. That is not the case with this wall charger because it has enough power to charge on on all four USB ports at  the same time and at full speed.The design it simple but looks nice. There is a LED light at the bottom that confirms that it's powered up. It comes with the standard US power adapter. This USB wall charger is reliable and a good choice if you want a simple and well made charger but don't need any bells and whistles.Sample provided for review.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is wall charger will charge all devices at once, need I say more!There are four USB ports that are used for charging an array of devices from tablets to Bluetooth headsets or whatever else needs a charge. In the hand, it has a nice solid feel. The body is plastic, which keeps the weight light but strong. The finish is matte that enhances the grip while in the hand. Also, the AC prongs can be removed, which makes it perfect for traveling inside your luggage. On a side note, you can use a laptop adapter cord to plug it into the wall, thus giving you more working room.This charger plugs directly into the wall, which might be a hang up for some. I do not see this as problem since I am able to charge all my devices at the same time in one location. Before this charger, I would have to charge devices all over the house, now those dreadful memories are a thing of the past.Before use, be sure to read the back of the charger and see what port you need for the device you are needing to charge. You can charge up to four devices at the same time, but the maximum overall output will limited to 6.8A. This can be seen as a gift or curse, to me it is a gift. Being able to charge a diverse group of devices is a great thing.I use this single charger on my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, Galaxy Note 2, and Bluetooth headset and speaker all at the same time. Now all of my devices are all in one place being charged, which is much easier.This is a must have charger if you have multiple mobile devices!FEATURES:4 USB Output Ports: 5V\/2A (2x), 5V\/1A (2x), (Max Of 6.8A When All Ports Used)I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.","rating":5},{"comment":"If you have many things to charge, save wall outlets and use this! It provides plenty of juice for four devices and is compact -- about the size of a deck of cards. Note: only came with a US plug.","rating":5},{"comment":"I have to admit, at first I couldn't quite see why I'd want yet another wall charger, however, I now get it. If you're like me, you'll have one of those huge ugly 4 gang plug sockets by the bedside, one for the smartphone charger, another for the iPad, yet another for the Kindle etc etc.This little device replaces all that. A single plug in charger, with 4 USB outputs - means you can charge up to 4 devices at one time from a single socket.It comes with a separate clip in US wall plug, or (if you already have one), you can plug in a figure of eight lead into the charger. Just clip in the plug adapter, plug it into the wall and off you go.Build quality appears good, and there's a blue light to indicate power. It comes with 4 USB sockets, with two each of 1.0 amp and 2.4 amp. Basically, you should charge a smartphone or kindle on the 1.0 amp sockets, and larger tablet computers on the 2.4 amp. It will take longer to charge from the lower power sockets, but it's safer for devices which need a lower power input.In conclusion, at this price, it's a great alternative to having four separate charge plugs, and small enough to pack for a holiday with the entire family.Disclosure: I was provided this by the manufacturer for an independent review, although it's a pleasure to review good quality items.Highly Recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is the perfect solution for road warriors and travelers. The unit provides two ports that are designed for any device, including Apple and legacy devices, and two that are also universal, but are optimized for Samsung and Blackberry devices.I tested it with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3, a Tab 3 10.1, an iPad2, an HTC Droid Incredible and a Kodak M763 camera. This charger charged them regardless of which port I used (and I purposely plugged the iPad into the Samsung optimized port and my Samsungs into the universal ports.) This leads me to conclude that not only does this charger have short circuit protection, but the ability to detect which device is plugged in and provide the appropriate level of charging current.My review sample came with the US two prong plug that did not require a specific polarity. The instructions showed other models of modular plugs from various countries, but no instructions on how to obtain them. However, the modular plug snaps into a standard figure eight connector, so you can purchase extension cords with the proper end and those will work.Of course it takes more than a cord, and this unit will auto sense and adapt to any AC voltage from 100 to 240, at either 50 or 60 cycles. So it is perfect for international travel.For domestic use I had no problems with any of the above-mentioned tests. Every device I tried charged (including a handful of bluetooth devices that I did not mention.) I am thoroughly pleased with it and it now occupies an outlet in my guest room with visitors and their inevitable array of 'toys'.","rating":5},{"comment":"With more and more devices these days requiring USB charger capabilities, it was inevitable that we'd start seeing chargers with more and more ports. With roughly a dozen USB devices of one kind or another, I need all the ports I can get. Two of the ports are higher-powered ports, suitable for Apple products and tablets of various kinds; the other two are lower-power, suitable for Android phones, Bluetooth headphones, and the like. Unlike some chargers, this has the power to charge on all ports simultaneously, although you will need to supply your own USB cables and Apple adapters.The charger is quite compact, about the same size as a similar two-port charger I've been using. One potential drawback is that there is no power cord: the device must plug directly into the wall. That's not uncommon and there is an easy workaround, to use an extension cord, but I figured I should note it.When I read a description like, &#34;Removeable Plug Portable Travel Charger,&#34; I expect to be able to swap the plug out with a plug more suitable to the locale to which I'm traveling. According to the manufacturer's website, you can get a version of this product with either a US, EU, or UK plug. But if there's a way to get any of the plugs by themselves, I was not able to locate it, either via a web search or the manufacturer's website. If you want all of the plugs, it looks like you have to purchase three separate chargers. I was able to locate the charger with the UK plug on the amazon.co.uk site. I wasn't able to locate the charger with the EU plug.I'm knocking off a star for that latter issue but otherwise I'm very pleased with this. I really like being able to charge so many devices at once and I like the convenient size. It does exactly what it claims and it does it very well. And at $12.99 at the time I write this review, it's very competitively priced. I have no hesitation in recommending it.Disclaimer: the manufacturer provided a sample for review purposes with no restrictions on the review outcome. I have no personal or financial interest in the company or in anyone employed there.","rating":4},{"comment":"I received this at no cost in exchange for writing a review. Here's why I like this.1. This is very lightweight and compact--2 1\/8 x 3 3\/8 x 1 1\/8. It has 4 ports that total 6.8A (two 2.4A and two 1.0A), but also has an output of 6.8A. That means unlike other wall chargers, you can actually charge 4 devices at once.2. Also unlike other wall chargers, there is no electrical cord. Although this has a figure 8 AC input opening as is common on some chargers, there is no electrical cord with a plug on the end that goes into it. Instead this unit cleverly has an AC plug that fits right in. While the prongs on that plug don't fold for travel, that's unnecessary because it takes just a second to remove the plug.This design has pros and cons. The pro is that there is no need to bring an electrical cord when you travel. The con is that it's not always convenient to plug a wall charger plug directly into a wall outlet or a power strip as opposed to using an electrical cord that gives you more freedom about where to place the wall charger and hogs less outlets. Of course you can use an extension cord for this unit, but then that defeats the convenience of a unit that doesn't require you to bring an electrical cord. It's all a matter of personal preference and something to be aware of. I bring extension cords with multiple outlets when I travel anyhow, so I'll just plug this into one of those outlets. I'm glad this doesn't have its own electrical cord, which is superfluous for me.Note: Although the directions say there are three other plugs available for international travel, there is no mention how to obtain them.Bottom line: Wall chargers are becoming more powerful and compact. I like this unit and am bringing it with me on an upcoming vacation to keep my gadgets charged.","rating":5},{"comment":"Opening up the sample package there was the US outlet adapter and the charger itself. Clearly marked on the charger are the 4 ports two of them are rated at 1 amp, and two are rated at 2.4 amp. I was not able to check out what their max output is.I used this after a long weekend using my phone and had 3 external batteries to charge. I charged the two largest batteries on the 2.4Amp ports and the smaller battery and my phone on the 1amp port. by morning My phone was charged and later that evening the other three batteries had charged. So compaired to the charge time with other 2 amp chargers I would say that this is a true 2.4 amp charger.I agree with the other reviewer that there is a note about other plugs being available but there are no other instructions on how to get them.I will be going on a business trip in the next few weeks and will need to charge multiple phones, a tablet, and External battery packs, this charger is going to be coming with me!Overall this is a must have charger to charge all gadgets!","rating":5},{"comment":"This USB Power Adapter does exactly what it is supposed to do and it does it well. This can eliminate multiple chargers for your tablets, smart phones, power banks, Bluetooth devices, etc. by giving you 4 outlets in one with the full charging power from a wall outlet.

To get them back quickly I've been using the Powerex Maha MH-C801D Eight Cell as my \"go to\" charger for years.  It's wasn't cheap but it works well.  This charger, the aLLreli, has some features I wish Maha had included.Firstly, this charger is a lot less expensive.  'nuff said there.Secondly, this charger has a brilliant display, both in terms of visibility and design.  When batteries are charging the display lights up in a pleasing blue. When it's done charging the display shuts off.  There's no guesswork about when it's done.  The Maha display is quite dim and it's nowhere near as easy to tell when the charging cycle has completed.  As an aside, neither charger completely shuts off.  Instead, they both drop into trickle charge mode, leaking a few mA into any batteries that are connected to ensure they stay charged.Thirdly, this charger will charge a dead battery... the Maha won't.  Again, 'nuff said.Lastly, this charger can be more convenient.  The AC plug is attached to the charge and folds into the unit when not in use.Both chargers have a \"Refresh\" mode.  (Maha calls it deep conditioning.)  They both do about the same thing, discharging your batteries completely before charging them.  That is something that was necessary for NiCad's.  Many people will argue that it can be harmful to NiMH batteries and the best advice is to use it sparingly, if at all.ALLreli sent this charger so I could provide you with a review.  My recommendation is that if you need a charger this is a good choice.  If you already have one, for the money this is a great backup (and occasionally required if you have a \"top of the line\" Maha).","rating":5},{"comment":"This battery charger is designed only for charging AA or AAA batteries. You can charge any combination of four batteries at a time. You can charge either Ni-MH or Ni-Cd rechargeable batteries. You can't charge regular alkaline batteries with this charger. I have a couple other battery chargers and one of them is just like this one but my other one can actually recharge standard alkaline batteries. Regular alkaline batteries are much less expensive that rechargeable batteries so that was a nice option to have. Another big difference is that my other chargers can also charge 9 volt, C and D batteries and unfortunately this charger can't do that either. My other chargers were between 3 and 4 times more expensive than this one so that's something to consider. Another good point is that AA and AAA are by far the most common batteries that I use. I only occasionally use C and 9 volt batteries and I hardly ever use D batteries at all.My other chargers are about six or eight times larger than this one and I like how compact this charger is. Visually I like the look of this charger better that the others. It can easily plug into any outlet and hang out of the way. Since it's super small it's easy to take with you as well. It can be handy for recharging AA batteries for digital camera while on vacation. We also have some Air Hog toys that take a lot of AA batteries and it's good for that as well. It has a nice blue LCD screen that is very easy to read. It shows each battery as it's charging and how fully charged it is. It's simple to tell when your batteries are finished charging. This charger also has a depleting function for draining the power from your batteries prior to charging them. Neither of my other chargers have this function and that's a huge plus. This will give you the best possible charge and long term battery life. I like that when not in use the plug folds into the charger. That makes it easier to throw into a bag and not snag on anything. The only thing that I don't like is that the plug is in the left side of the charger instead of the middle. I guess it really doesn't make a difference but it just looks a little odd.This charger will fully charge your batteries overnight and the charge seems the same as when using my other chargers. It's my charger or choice for AA or AAA batteries but I wish it could charge C, D or 9 volt batteries. But again the cost of this charger is the lowest that I have seen for a quality charger. If you only need to charge AA or AAA batteries then this would be a very good choice.Sample provided for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a great way keep all your batteries charged.The design is simple, yet very effective.

This charger helps me ensure that I have a steady supply ready for each performance.While this charger will not simultaneously charge all of the batteries the KC-110 needs, it makes charging them in groups of four fast, sure and safe. The LED indicator is more convenient than you can imagine because I tend to multi-task and sometimes lose track of things. The older charger I was using had red and green lights, but no way for me to tell if I had at least sufficiently charged batteries I could grab if I were strapped for time. This one tells me just how charged up each battery is (in thirty-three percent increments).What I especially love and why I rated this five solid stars is the refresh feature. This charger will drain down a battery and recharge it, which actually prolongs the battery life. If you read the description and wondered what 'memory effect' is, that is the tendency of a battery to cause false readings. Some batteries will be at 100 percent, but display a different number (or display fully charged, but not be). The activation function on this charger will correct that.I tested all of the above features and they work as described. While the world may seem to be moving towards batteries that power phones, tablets and just about everything else, the AA and AAA rechargeable are still very much in use and it you are using them, this is definitely the charger to get.","rating":5},{"comment":"Excellent charger. Nice display. Sample provided for a fair and honest review. Anything that can help save batteries and recycle is good. Worked right out of the box.  Sample provided for a fair and honest review.","rating":5},{"comment":"First, it's a great value for what it is-- let me get that out of the way.I've been a rechargeable battery user for many years-- maybe even earlier than the Rayovac Renewals and even the NiCad batteries. I have never been one to spend a lot of money on the sophisticated chargers that give a digital readout on each cell, but I also don't buy the cheapest chargers. I've typically spent a bit more on the rapid 15 minute chargers and have been generally pleased with those. My last two were Energizer brand.What this has that a good quality rapid charger doesn't have is that it charges each cell independently. If you have  bad one, the others charge anyway. With my rapid charger, if one cell is bad you have to remove it, and it doesn't tell you which one. Often you can just put the hand across and see which one is cold, remove it, and try again. If charging continues more than a second, you've removed it.This one also has the drain & recharge feature that the rapid charger doesn't have.I really like this charger, though it is not a rapid charger, because it has some additional functionality that my rapid charger doesn't. It can step in when I have a battery that won't charge (charging from 0v) and to drain and recharge. That being said there are a couple design features that could use improvement on this model.The LCD is very hard to see unless you are looking at it head-on. I do my charging on the kitchen counter and the wall outlet is between waist and stomach level. At that angle I have to get directly down over in front of it to see the status. The good news is that the light stays blue until it's done, so I don't *have* to investigate every time. The second design thing I had was how the AAA battery fits in the unit.  While the unit has instructions written in very clear English, it doesn't describe that the AAA battery fits in at an angle where the + side tilts out from the body of the charger. Once you learn & discover how this works, it is not an issue, but that needs explained. All of my previous chargers let the AAA fit body-flat against the charging base just like the AA, so this was completely unexpected. I'm surprised I didn't break the charger during this discovery\/trial stage.Overall, I was really pleased with the charger. If it were a rapid charger as well, it would really elate me, but short of that it has some functionality that my rapid charger doesn't have, I can live with the LCD angle issue and after learning that the AAA tilts out, it's a pretty solid and functional kit. I'd have no concerns buying this charger for my dad as a gift.By a lot of patient hours, days and years of reviewing, I found myself in the top reviewers on Amazon.

DELL had a sale for $200.00 for this model, and we could not pass up the opportunity. All in all, this is an excellent laptop for kids or very basic laptop for a family.PROS:1. CHIP: Intel Celeron (dual core). This is a latest Celeron chip (N2830, Bay Trail - M) you will have. Being a dual core can handle most of the demands easily. Because it is a Bay Trail chip, it is quiet and not heavy on your resources. It is so quiet, you hardly hear the fan at all. So for your Web browsing, emails, YouTube viewing, MS Office, some gaming, and every day chores, this is a great basic laptop.2. BUILD. The black matte finish is not fancy but functional. Simple but sturdy. The keyboard has no flex, and comes with chiclet keyboard that is well designed and generously spaced. The screen is bright and resolution is normal for this price range.3. PRICE. Price differs from store to store, but if you get it in right time, you might get it for around $200.00. Even $250 is a good price. To give you a comparison: various Chromebooks are priced in this range but with less functions and memories. Additionally, you CANNOT install any Windows programs (such as, MS Office, etc), so while Chromebooks have their proper place, for those who need basic laptop for general use, this laptop might be a better fit in this price range.4. OS. Windows 8.1 is far, far better than Windows 8.0. If you already have 8.0, then you should update\/upgrade it to 8.1. I love using it, and my kids love the tiles. PLUS, I love 8.1's Family Safety feature. I can control how much my kids can be on the computer and what days. Additionally you can also filter what kind of web they are browsing. MS also sends you (the parent) weekly report on the kids use of the computer. Love this feature! Easy to set up and monitor.CONS:1. No optical Drive (DVD\/CD). But nowadays, this is not really needed anymore. But for those who need it, you might have to consider other models.2. No Bluetooth. The box says, \"Bluetooth\" but this is misprint. This model does NOT have Bluetooth.3. Only 2 USB (2.0) ports. I was hoping that it had another USB port.Despite the cons, considering its price, this is an excellent entry laptop for kids and those who just want sturdy, dependable laptop for every day general use.

I spoke to the representative for a short while and she too saw it was still under warranty.

A fully functional windows 8.1 15.6&#34; laptop costing in the low $200s is mind blowing. Part of the $ savings derives from the lack of an optical drive or touch screen.There isn't much to say. I've had it for about 2 weeks, so I can't judge durability. The laptop is made from cheap plastic, but the screen is nice, the keyboard feels sturdy and comfortable, you have a full numeric keypad. The only negative is the trackpad, which is usable but not good. We prefer to use a mouse instead.We only use it for basics, like web browsing, Office, printing, sending email. It's certainly fast enough for all that. It connects to the wifi network quickly, and web browsing is fine.I bought it from Dell and it came with a 1year home repair warranty.

But, it makes a good second back up laptop for me.  I'm using it to write this review right now.  I ordered mine from dell, at the time it was cheaper than amazon, and dell had them in stock.  I did remove the hard drive and replaced it with an SSD I had laying around which helped speed it up considerably.  It is a bit laggy at times, but overall it is usable and better than I would have expected for this price range.Here are the pros as I see them:-The price, the price, the price-The weight is much lighter than my I7 high end laptop-Battery lasts 5-7.5 hours depending on use, many Windows laptops in this price range only last 3 hours so this is a huge advantage.-The battery is user replaceable, which you can't take for granted anymore in a laptop.  Press two buttons and it pops right out!-Many laptops recently make it very hard to get access to the RAM and Harddrive for upgrades.  Several dells require you to completely disassemble the entire laptop to get to the hard drive including removing the screen, motherboard, track pad etc.  Which is a huge pet peave of mine.  This laptop has an access panel on the bottom to access the RAM and HD which is great!-A large 15.6 inch screen for a great price-This CPU doesn't run hot at all and has decent performance for the price.-It runs so cool it doesn't even have a fan at all!-Keyboard has a number pad, many don't in this price range.-Keyboard feels nice and doesn't feel too cheap, we will see with time though how it holds up.-Trackpad works good, buttons are loud when clicked though.-Nice to have a Windows laptop for this price, I like chromebooks but I can't connect to my at home Samba server from a chromebook so I gravitate to Windows.Cons:-There are the obvious ones like no USB 3, no Bluetooth, no wired ethernet, no CD\/DVD Drive.  But in this price range I'm ok with that.  I have an external USB CD\/DVD that I used to install Office on it so that wasn't an issue for me.-Windows 8.1, is better than 8.0 but if you have never used it before there is a learning curve for sure compared to Windows 7\/Vista-Not blazing fast but you can't expect that from any pc in this price range.-Case feels cheap, it creaks and groans when I pick it up by a corner.-The quality of the video is pretty low, but once again it is usable for watching youtube, netflix videos, etc.  Just is less sharp than my high end laptop and can be a tad laggy occasionally.Would I recommend this???  Depends on your needs.  If you are on a tight budget and are a light PC user who wants to use it just for basic web surfing, Word Processing, and light youtube\/netflix watching this will work fine for most peopleIf you are a high end, heavy user, I'd only use this as a backup laptop.  I would not be happy with this as my primary laptop personally since I'm a very heavy user.If you are a gamer, you of course know enough to not even look at this laptop as an option.Upgrade possibilities:  If you know what you are doing upgrading the hard drive to an SSD will help it feel more useable.  Also, I have not done so yet, but my understanding is that you can upgrade this to 8GB of ram which could help too.  It only has one slot for ram so you will have to remove the stock 4gb and replace it with an 8GB.  Make sure to get the DDR3L (The L stands for low voltage).  You want the 1.35 volt not 1.5 it may work with the 1.5 but will run hotter and use more battery.  The laptop comes with 1333mhz ram, but I think 1600mhz will work and run faster.  Take this with a grain of salt as have not tried it yet, but I believe the following RAM will work, and this is the type I plan to try upgrading to someday.http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kingston-Technology-1600MHz-PC3-12800-KVR16LS11\/dp\/B00CQ35HBQ\/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1402328644&sr;=8-2&keywords;=8GB+DDR3+1600MHz+sodimm+DDR3LUpdate 6\/23\/14: I did buy and install the 8gb of Ram above.  It works great, but it does down clock the ram to 1333mhz as the CPU won't handle 1600mhz speeds.  But, the 1600mhz 1.35v ram does work great in here.  It feels even snappier now.  Between the SSD I installed and the 8gb of ram this computer is very usable and fairly snappy for most tasks.  The only time I see the video and cpu lagging a bit is if I am on a webpage with heavy adobe flash usage on it.  But, right now I have two browsers open and about 30 browser tabs open with now slowdown.  I'm still quite happy with this laptop for the money.

It is a fully functional system with a bright easy to read screen, that is perfect for web browsing, checking email, watching movies download to the hard drive and has fired right up even after sitting in my hot car for most of the day.It is a bit sluggish with high performance software and that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Overall, a really great system and one that will serve you well.  I suggest this a starter system for middle school age children that have the discipline to care for such items but don't need the high power and extras of a more expensive system.Outstanding value!","rating":4},{"comment":"Modern laptops are becoming more powerful all the time. More RAM and hard drive space along with faster CPUs make many of them true desktop replacement PCs, and there seems to be no end to the enhancements in sight.But not everyone needs the fastest, most powerful laptop on the block. If you just need a laptop that does a good job at surfing the Internet, checking email, watching Youtube videos and making simple edits to photos, a good budget model should serve you quite well.The Dell Inspiron i3531-1200BK is a 15.6 inch laptop that will do everything mentioned above, and more. While it won&#8217;t be setting any speed records, it&#8217;s plenty fast enough and powerful enough to do what the average Internet user needs for a budget laptop to do.It comes with an Intel Celeron N2830 CPU, 4GB of RAM (expandable to 8GB), a 500 GB hard drive, 802.11bgn Wi-Fi support and a built-in webcam. Another nice feature is a numeric keypad which is something of a rarity among budget laptops. Add in the average 6.5 hour battery life and you can see that this is a pretty capable machine for the money!Of course at just $250 there are bound to be a few tradeoffs to consider, and that&#8217;s certainly the case here. For example, there is no optical drive for installing software from disc, watching DVDs or listening to CDs. But few people do those things with laptops anymore anyway, and if you need to you can always plug in an inexpensive external USB optical drive.The video quality provided by this laptop isn&#8217;t the sharpest around, but most users will find it quite adequate for watching Internet videos and such.Overall, this is a good entry-level budget laptop. The price just can&#8217;t be beat, and unless you need a laptop for gaming or running resource-intensive software such as Adobe Photoshop, I think you&#8217;ll find it to be a very viable option for your basic Internet and general purpose computing needs.","rating":5},{"comment":"The overall functionality of this laptop is great.  Being able to flip it open and start typing like a normal laptop is very productive.  Once the work is done, flip the screen all the way back and browse the interweb with a flick of the finger.  It really is the best of both worlds.In the styling departiment it is just decent.  Besides the flip screen there are no innovative features.  The weight is just slightly heavier then I'd would like, but it won't kill your hand if you are using it as a tablet.  Their 'windows' button on the screen is kind of annoying cause it is right where I'd put my hand.  The silver finish seems to be prone to scratching, just a few weeks has produced several small scratches just sitting on my desk.  The hinge system seems robust so that will be good in the long run.  The rubber feet on the bottom are leaving marks on the back of the screen when flipped into tablet mode.For being a small laptop, it is still easy to type on.There does seem to be some software build issues straight out the box.  After the initial large burst of updates the laptop was running very slow.  Eventually it cleared, but I have noticed other instances of slow down.  It seems to have mostly cleared up after 3 weeks.The touchscreen works great.  It has great accuracy even around the edges.  I've used other tablets that seem to not be able to read touches around the edges, which is really annoying when you are trying to close a program.  It is pretty responsive but no where near as quick as an iPad.  To be fair, I haven't seen any Windows tablets match the speed and accuracy of an iPad.The mouse touchpad is another weak point.  It is at times too sensitive and then at other times not responsive.  I also had some instances where using the touchscreen and then using the touchpad somehow 'broke' the touchpad functionality.  I was not able to click or scroll using the touchpad, only could move the cursor.  Rebooting fixed the problem.Overall it is a good little laptop, I wouldn't use it for AAA games, but for doing a little work and a little play it packs a big punch.Side note, check out the Lenovo Yoga for a strong contender in this market.","rating":3},{"comment":"Pros:&#8226; Folds and bends without issue&#8226; Automatically disables keyboard very quickly when you fold it upside down for use as a tablet&#8226; Lightweight, slim, maneuverable and not cumbersome&#8226; Pretty good performance for such a small laptop&#8226; Great battery life&#8226; Fast startup and shutdown times&#8226; Speakers are surprisingly good qualityCons:&#8226; Corners of the touch screen have given me issues in terms of sensitivity and recognizing when I click the corner.

I'm glad Intel changed the name from Atom to Pentium because of the previous stigma attached to the slow Atom CPUs. The CPU in this one is now an out-of-order design and has competent graphics. The one thing I did do is upgrade to an SSD. This REALLY makes the thing feel much faster. Battery life is phenomenal as well. There are a few little issues. The keyboard is a little 'flexy' when typing, but not unusable by any means. The touchpad will sometimes just not work. I've found that this is the keyboard and touchpad locking software for when the screen is flipped. If you flip the screen over and back, it will fix the touch pad. I've also disabled the built in Synaptics gestures and installed 2-finger-scroll. Its much better and more consistent than the Synaptics control panel. I'm thinking of upgrading to 8GB of RAM, but haven't yet decided as I haven't had any slow down with the workload I put on the machine. Overall, its pretty good, not great. If the touchpad could be fixed, I'd give it 5 stars for sure.As a side note, if Dell offered one of these with a Haswell i3 for $100-150 more, I'd plunk that down without hesitation. I'm not looking for an i7 quadcore or anything, but just not a 'budget' machine. However, until laptop OEMs realize that small doesn't need to be low end or ultra high end, I'll be fine with this one.","rating":4},{"comment":"If you want a fast tablet experience, then get a tablet.If you want a fast light weight laptop with a real OS, then buy an ultrabook.If you'd like both but only have enough money for a tablet... then this is an EXCELLENT compromise.The build quality excellent. It's strong & light and works in a number of different ways... Laptop style, flat, back bend for video playback, or as a tablet. In case you were wondering, yes the keyboard is exposed on the back when in the tablet configuration, but the keys are disabled once the screen is flipped around, plus they're recessed so they aren't really in the way. The battery life has been very good I've gotten at least 6 hours of life if not more. The Windows 8.1 OS is reasonable for tablet use and the touchscreen works well with it. And while it doesn't come across as zippy, It loads fast enough that I don't get video lag or ever feel like I'm waiting on it either. It does seem to run faster when plugged in. So if you're doing anything intensive, it's not a bad idea to plug in.The only cons I can think of are the lack of dedicated F keys (they're shared with the number row), and I've had one small hiccup with the trackpad in Chrome (fixed with a reboot). Other than that it hasn't locked up or acted unexpectedly.Overall, if money is tight any you need the laptop for work\/school but would like to occasionally flip it back and just consume content then this is a great deal.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Dell Inspiron i3147-3750sLV 11.6 inch 2 in 1 Convertible Touchscreen Laptop hybrid is a decent choice for basic computing needs. It incorporates the versatility of a laptop with the ease of use and convenience of a tablet. The best feature is the touch screen which is very responsive, but the track pad sometimes lags and is not as responsive. The screen is very clear, with vibrant colors and good off angle viewing. The construction of the hybrid good and solid. It does not feel cheap, even considering it's low cost. This product would be best used for web browsing, office applications, and light gaming.","rating":3},{"comment":"I wasn't sure what to expect with this because I have another laptop with similar specs but a different Intel processor and different brand and it seems to give me those high usage warnings frequently, especially when multi-tasking and\/or watching videos and movies.  I am so pleased to say that I have had zero issues with this one so this processor and setup must do the trick.  It works like a dream! BTW, this is an Intel Pentium N3530 2.16 Ghz.  At the bottom of the page w\/comparable specs, it shows an Intel Celeron.I haven't really had a huge desire for a tablet because I just thought I prefer the laptop style and I figured this would just be cumbersome, but I was wrong about this too.  This is a very small laptop but a large tablet and it is so easily mobile.  It's very lightweight and just flipping it all the way open and folding the keyboard back is so simple.  It makes it so portable and you just pull up the virtual keyboard on the screen and all works perfectly.  The screen adjusts to whether you are holding vertically or horizontally just as it does on a tablet.The display, sound and webcam are fantastic too.  I've had issues with sound recently on laptops so I'm so glad I hear well on this one.  With such a small laptop I wasn't sure but it works great and the screen resolution is pristine.  The whole computer feels quality even though lightweight.  When I pulled it out of the box and it was so compact and light I was a bit hesitant and unsure.  Give it just a little time. Once you get used to it I think you will be so pleasantly surprised.Finally, I will admit I've owned a few Dell laptops over the years and was less than impressed. However, I got a Dell desktop a few months back and it is fantastic and have had no issues with it.  And just since I've had this one, I like it more and more the longer I have it. So, I think they may have turned a corner on any issues they've had.  I know I have with any that I've had with them.  Great, quality products and enthusiastically recommend this computer, especially if you have to tote a laptop around frequently but don't want an open tablet as I didn't.UPDATE: I've had this computer for several weeks and have still had no error messages or high usage warnings.  I noticed that there was a 3 star review on here that said it is basic and the trackpad isn't responsive.  I want to say that my trackpad is very responsive. Because this is such a small laptop it may take some getting used to - pad itself is large.  Also, for this price point and with these specs, this computer performs amazingly well. I can watch movies or livestream while performing other tasks and have no problems at all.  No, it's not for heavy gamers, but I think most of them would not search for these specs and dimensions. I find myself taking this from room to room all throughout the day because it's so portable. Still enthusiastically 5 stars for me!I've had a couple of questions about the keyboard...it is pretty small because it is a small computer and, thus, a little harder to type on.  I definitely find it easier to type on the larger keyboards and miss that.  However, I would lose the easy portability if they made it any larger and I wouldn't want that.","rating":5},{"comment":"Love it.just like the bigger ones with all the l&#34;lights, knobs and whistles&#34; but in miniature size with 11 hour battery.","rating":5},{"comment":"Set up was indeed a breeze - 8 mins after breaking open the box I was up and running.

I've also had one from Foscam and feel this Belkin is a step up. Set up is fairly easy and the integration with a Belkin wireless router is a plus. Not sure how having a non-Belkin router affects your performance. The resolution is good at 720p, 1080p would be better but there are tradeoffs to make. As it is the 720p is good enough for my use. The best plus of this is the ease of accessing and viewing the video from an iPhone. It's never been easy with my Foscam and the third party apps are just not that good from what I've tried. That's the key feature for me: being able to view video remotely. This Belkin does the trick and so far so good. Hope this review helps a little in making your decision.","rating":4},{"comment":"I've been through several WiFi cameras lately, and the Belkin has certainly proven to be one of the better options. Image quality is good, and the camera itself is small, stable and unobtrusive.Out of the box, it's easy to setup - you can be up and running in just a few minutes if you follow the instructions closely. It's small enough that you can mount it anywhere, and the swiveling base gives you a lot of freedom in positioning. It communicates over your WiFi network - be sure you have good signal strength in the area you want to monitor - and like a lot of these devices, the connection flows out from the device to a manufacturer's website...although you might legitimately be concerned about privacy on the Belkin site, this means you don't need to open firewall ports. In my opinion, this is a better bet from a security point of view.Image quality is perhaps slightly above average for this type of product. You can argue that 720p is hi-def, but to me, the limiting factor is the degree of compression applied to the signal. A reasonable home-grade 720p camcorder, for example, would record at something around 10-12 megabits per second, but the Belkin is only a small fraction of this - and that's where the image quality suffers. True, most people wouldn't want 10-12 megabits of their Internet bandwidth consumed by a camera, so there are valid tradeoffs to be made - but don't expect DVD quality images just because it's labeled &#34;HD&#34;. Still, if your goal is to monitor on a smartphone, then you probably don't need any more than what the Belkin delivers.Speaking of remote viewing, the Belkin iOS app is okay, though a bit rough in spots. Still, it's pretty much everything you need to look in on your camera, and unlike some manufacturers, it's totally free to use. That is, unless you sign up for Cloud video storage - essentially a DVR in the cloud.I couldn't get the Belkin to work reliably with my home automation system (Micasa Verde Vera 3). There is a plug-in for Belkin WeMo devices, but it didn't seem to be able to discover the camera, and even when I configured it by hand, it never worked.Bottom line is that if you want a basic, inexpensive video monitor that's simple to setup and low cost, the Belkin is worth a look.","rating":4},{"comment":"The latest version of this camera does a lot of things right that previous versions failed at.First of all, the 720p video quality - both at night with the auto-enabled IR and during the day - is clear and sharp. Moreso, the wide-angle lens has a great field of vision.The software - on iOS - is fine. It's just not great. There isn't a lot you can do and - one of the biggest issues I have with the camera itself - there is no rotation like FoSCam and many other cameras feature.I will say, if you are a WeMo household, like we are, the software automatically recognized the camera and lets you do a number of cool things, including triggering any other WeMo operations with motion. It's well done, nicely integrated - but unfortunately the WeMo software operates completely separate from the camera software itself - clearly, this needs better integration (WeMo can create a rule, but to 'watch' the camera, the app opens the other app, and you have to manually switch back). It works, but its not elegant.The audio - both in and out - is fine, and about the same as comparable cams out there. Not great, but it works.Of course, recording offsite is an additional fee, but so is the case with competitors.Bottomline, there isn't much NOT to like about the camera; if only the software was a bit better integrated with WeMo, and the native cam software was a little more elegant. I really miss a motor for rotation, but otherwise, it's a great little camera. Not enough to differentiate from competitors products however, unless you do utilize WeMo in your house already.Setup was easy once - and it took several tries - the wireless signal from the cam was found.","rating":4},{"comment":"some excellent reviews on this product, and I agree with the valid points of fellow vine members.  The HD rez, makes a diference, specaillyif viewing on larger than phone displays...and even on phone size displays, u can zoom deeper.  Set up much improved IMO vs. their previous models... as others have mentioned, movement would be nice, but that is not what Belkin is after.  Foscam seems to have captured the movement cameras...  overall, for the price, a very nice camera, even if u are now Wemos ready, which I am not...","rating":5},{"comment":"There's a lot to like but I'm feeling very frustrated because I'm sure this camera can be so much more.I set it up on my iPhone 5 and it was as about as easy as setting up a couple of Belkin WeMo wall plugs that I also have installed. Nice that the camera shows up not only on the NetCam app but also on the WeMo app. Quality of picture is great, as far as I'm concerned and voice is OK. I have it set up by the front door and like that it sends me an e-mail everything it detects motion. Then I can go to the app and potentially see what's going on.Here's a list of some of my frustrations. Some might just be my stupidity but some aren't. I can't find an app to download to my iPad, which, of course has a much bigger screen. Unlike any other photos or videos on my phone, I can't use the pinch function to zoom, so can't really see much... especially to recognize a face. The camera seems to be of good quality, so zooming should produce results... but the software doesn't seem capable. The menu tells me I can \"select a \"NetCam Cloud+ plan from your camera settings\" but I don't see it. The infrared lights on the camera bounce off my window, so at night all I see is a reflection. I'd put it outside but am afraid it might be stolen.With regard to motion detection, it seems to take a picture mostly once the action is over... delayed? Also, even though I have it on what appears to be the least sensitive setting, it is going off every time a car goes by on the street, rather than only when someone walks up to my front porch. There must be adjustments, but I haven't found them. I'm getting e-mail several times an hour, rather than several times a day.It sure beats stringing wires and I love being able to pull it up on my iPhone but it isn't much of a surveillance camera yet... at least not for me. Maybe one of you geniuses can help me solve my issues. ;)Update: I did get some helpful advice from Belkin. I can now view on my laptop and iPad. Plus, I have another option for setting sensitivity. However, no matter how I set it I am still getting too many notifications with nothing in the frame, which I assume is due to a delay between detecting motion and snapping the picture. Still rates four stars for me.  That's a better four stars than my original rating but still can't go to five.","rating":4},{"comment":"Including this Belkin netcam, I have 3 other netcams from 2 other brands (D-Link 930 and Neewer) and this is by far the best quality and the easiest to set up and use.First of all, installation was the easiest. I just downloaded the app on my iPhone, started it, plugged in the netcam, set up the ID and password and it was all ready. Same thing with my PC. I just logged into the Belkin website, entered my ID and PW and it was ready to go. Took all of 10 minutes to get it done. Compared to installation of the other two brands, this was a breeze.The quality of the picture of this Belkin was also the best. The website experience was also the best and the easiest with Belkin. Both this and Neewer required the installation of some software, but Dlink requires my Java to be running and it's usually off on my PC.Overall, for ease of installation and usage, I give Belkin 5 stars. It look me less than 10 mins to get it running and the quality of the picture was great.","rating":5},{"comment":"While the pictures are outstanding from this, the video quality is terrible, and hardly \"HD\". It may take 720p pictures, but it can't stream HD at full video rates, even when you're on the same LAN as the camera. The video is motion-blurred and stutters horribly unless you intentionally downgrade the video stream to standard definition. This is a shame, because it's clearly an issue with the device not being powerful enough to encode and stream at HD. The sensor itself is quite good, and the still frames from this camera are outstanding.The audio is next to useless, unfortunately, and has constant clicking artifacts, which I assume is the WiFi signal interfering with the poorly designed audio circuitry.To do any motion detection or clip recording--that is, to do anything very useful with this camera--requires a monthly subscription. Furthermore, the motion detection is very poorly engineered, and can't do regions of interest, and I have yet to find a setting which doesn't just trigger dozens of useless movie clips every day just because wind moved a tree.The iOS app is horribly engineered. It constantly hangs, can't record video at anything other than a few frames per second, often produces video that has errors so that the iPhone can't play it back, and forces you to watch a few second animation of Belkin's stupid logo every single bloody time you start it up.Perhaps worst of all: there is no way to operate this camera purely over a LAN. Even if you don't want to use the cloud features, this camera will be in constant communication with Belkin's servers to \"punch a hole\" in your firewall and allow external communication to the device. If they wanted to, anybody at the company Belkin outsources the web application to could view your camera, any time it's powered up. More importantly, anybody that hacked their servers could do so, too. Lord knows what they could do from the camera, since it's basically a small computer in its own right. A good hacker could probably reverse engineer the firmware and reprogram the camera to attack your network from inside your firewall. Basically, this camera is a computer on your local network behind your firewall that a company you shouldn't trust now has permanent access to. I'm not really happy about that. You should be able to turn off the ability for the camera to be reachable by the world beyond your firewall, but that's not possible. As such, this is about the least secure camera you can buy. Is it worse than a drop cam in terms of security? I don't think so, but I wouldn't recommend one of those either. I would recommend a camera that allows you to operate entirely within your LAN, such as a FOSCAM.I've been really disappointed with Belkin's products recently. They seem to be trying to make money off subscriptions, but are forgetting to deliver a quality product off of which to to base them. I don't appreciate being forced into a subscription just to do things that shouldn't require the cloud. As an option, fine, but this product is useless without the cloud, paid or otherwise. What happens when Belkin decides to write off this product, as they did with their terrible baby monitors? How long will they continue to support the servers for this? Without their servers, this device is just a door stop.","rating":3},{"comment":"The image quality of this camera is quite good.  I was looking forward to using this camera to monitor my carport where my car and front door is.  However, there are several issues which makes it almost impossible to use as a motion detector outdoors.  First, you cannot tell the software to exclude certain portions of the image from motion detection, so you can only monitor an area without anything that can move in the wind, such as trees and bushes otherwise you get hundreds of useless video clips.  I am using this camera behind glass, so I cannot use the night vision feature because the lights shine back in the reflection in the glass.  No big deal, since my carport is lit at night.  But after mounting the camera in a place where there were no trees in the image and turning off the night vision lights, the camera was still detecting motion the whole night because the camera constantly tries to adjust to low lighting conditions, so it detects the brightness adjustments that it applies as motion... again, resulting in hundreds of useless clips throughout the night.So, using this camera for outdoor viewing is difficult.  Indoor use is preferred and works a lot better.  Live image quality on my phone and on the website looks great and works surprisingly well.  I really wish this camera did not require premium subscription services for the most useful features though.  There is no reason this camera shouldn't be able to save clips to a location on your network, since it is already connected to it via WiFi.  Also, it would have been a lot better if Belkin allowed you to use Google Drive or Dropbox for storage instead of requiring a separate subscription from Belkin.  As of the time of my review, I haven't even been able to find anything about pricing after the 30-day trial has ended.If you plan on using this camera indoors to monitor video and audio and don't mind a subscription fee, this camera is an excellent choice.  Otherwise, I would consider alternatives.","rating":4},{"comment":"The hardware is fine.  It is a nice little camera with a pretty good IR light for night vision.  The wifi range is good and the picture quality is fine.  It has two way audio that works OK with the app.The big problem I have with this camera is that, although it is a wifi camera, it is locked into the Belkin NetCam and WeMo apps.  It cannot be accessed directly over IP and you cannot access the camera through any third-party apps.  The Belkin apps are terrible.  They often require you to relogin and you cannot keep the window open for more than 5 minutes before it forces you to relogin.  There is no pinch-zoom either.Do yourself a favor and just buy a D-Link 932 - which is essentially the same camera, for 1\/3 the price and open to third party apps.","rating":2},{"comment":"I love Belkin products, so I expected a lot, but I find this camera quite disappointing, both on the hardware level and especially on the software level.The frame rate is wicked slow, is my main disappointment with the hardware.The software has many dimensions of frustration. I think if I'd tried it only on my iPhone, I might have been happy with things, but the web interface was totally wonky. On the iPhone you can create an account and be up and running quickly. On the web only (which I tried first), everything was uber confusing. For example, you can have a Belkin account\/login, but that's not the same thing as having a Belkin\/netcam login. The login page just kept refreshing in Firefox, with no way to proceed to anything. In Safari, I was still having a hard time getting anything to work before I moved over to creating an account and doing setup with the phone. (I don't like typing on the phone, so on my keyboard seemed a better option for me, but the interface just wasn't going to work... probably I lost a lot of patience for this when I was trying Firefox.)Once I had it setup on the phone, I got an error message in my Firefox window that &#34;If you are using Firefox 11.1 or newer, you may experience some unexpected issues. We suggest using a different browser or downgrading your flash.&#34; Um, what? I am using FIrefox 30. So, fine, forget Firefox... but I still could never actually see a picture with Safari, even though I did manage to login and select the camera.On the phone, it barfed out on me once (possibly due to my attempts to use browsers), and I had to reset the camera to get going again.Oh, and when I was getting going, it kept prompting me for firmware updates... I did the update and eventually realized that it was having me install the same update repeatedly.I do kinda like that one of the intended uses is to tell you when there's motion, and that part seems to work well. I turned the notifications on, and have been getting updates.So overall, my big disappointment here is with the software, which is something that Belkin can remedy. I will update the review and the stars if this turns into a product I'd actually like to use.","rating":2},{"comment":"My house has suffered from a break-in in the past, and since then, I've been looking for various ways to protect my home.  One such measure was to get a wireless security camera.  The Belkin NetCam is actually the second cam I've owned, but it's probably the better of the two.One of the biggest positives was how easy it was to set the NetCam up.  Activation is completely wireless (unlike my previous camera, a Foscam) and the included quick start guide made for a fast, easy installation that took less than 10 minutes.  The camera's set up is done via an iOS or Android app, which, while barebones, is easy to use and understand.Speaking of the app, I use the iOS app on my phone, and it works great.  I can view live video, turn the microphone on\/off, and activate the speaker.  The other camera I had used a web-based interface, which wasn't as easy to use, though, admittedly, it did allow for more detailed control.  I prefer the smartphone\/tablet app route, as it makes monitoring my camera much easier.Another positive for me is picture quality.  My previous camera's resolution was 640x480.  This camera's output is 1280x720.  Plus, it has a wide angle lens, so it can capture more of an area (as compared to my old security cam).  This camera also features infrared lights, giving the NetCam night vision.And my final reason for liking the NetCam so much is its compact size.  It's much less conspicuous sitting on my shelf compared to my other camera, which was easily twice as large.As for cons, the Foscam I had had pan and tilt, which means I could remotely control where the camera is aimed.  The Belkin NetCam doesn't feature that.  It's on a swivel arm and once you set it, that's it.  As a security cam or baby monitor, that's usually not a big deal, though, so I'm fine with that.I also don't care for how frequently the camera emails me photos because it detected &#34;motion.&#34;  I don't know what it's picking up on, but I get dozens of email a day, with ZERO real activity.  I can easily foresee a &#34;boy who cried wolf&#34; scenario, where a real problem could go unnoticed until it's too late, because the owner thinks it's just another bogus email.  To be fair, my Foscam suffered from the same problem.That, coupled with the fact that the camera seems late in snapping security photos may render this useless for many.  In my use, the camera is sitting on a shelf facing my front door.  If I set motion detect sensitivity to low, it reduces the number of false alarms, but it either completely misses REAL activity (my entering or leaving) or has blurred or mis-timed photo (my back as I close the door).  If I set it to high, I get a lot more false positives (tons of emails) and it still is hit-and-miss (though it does give me more useable photos).  In this regard, the Foscam was better.  I still suffered from tons of emails, but I had more usable photos.Overall, I'm still happy with this camera and will use it to replace my Foscam.  It fits better in the location I have it, I prefer the field of view the lens gives, and the app makes it much easier to use.  I'd recommend it more as a baby monitor or live feed camera, as opposed to strictly as a security camera, but it does an OK job in that regard, too.  A soft four (maybe 3.5) stars.","rating":4},{"comment":"The good:* Easy to set up with a mobile app. When you power on the camera, it creates its own wi-fi network. You tell your iPhone or Android device to use that network, run the free mobile app, and associate it with your normal wi-fi network and an online account.* Cheap. Wi-fi cameras are really coming down in price, and this is in the middle of the low end price range* Mobile app works well at home and away. It's smart enough to use peer-to-peer if the mobile device and camera are on the same network, and it relays through a third-party service if one is away* Integrates with the WeMo app. It can be used as a motion detector to trigger power on\/off rules on other WeMo devices.* The IR vision actually works. Often these are muddy and unusable on low-end cameras. Here it's decently crisp* 1280x720 resolution (720p) makes the camera quite usable even at a distance of 20-30 feet* Built in microphone works fairly well, even when subjects are 10 feet away* A website is provided for viewing the camera in a regular browser. Flash is all that's required.* The mobile app can save snapshots and video clips directly to the camera roll (tested on iPhone) - the video integration was a nice surpriseThe bad:* No matter what, you're not getting a decent framerate out of this. It looks like 8-10fps despite the listed specs, even when little is changing in the frame. There's also a significant lag (2-3 seconds) that you just won't get rid of with the web view. Less on the mobile app.* Big mobile app annoyance: Every time one switches to the mobile app, it plays a pointless animation. Every. Single. Time. If you toggle between the camera and text messaging for example, you will watch this animation for what feels an eternity. It doesn't even resume the last active camera view, even if only leaving the mobile app for 2 seconds.* Wide-angle view that you can't disable. It works relatively well for up-close objects. But there's significant fish eye on anything even 5 feet away. This is definitely a surveillance camera, not usable for chatting or other such uses.* The built-in two-way audio feature is nearly useless. Audio from the camera to the mobile device works fairly well, but the speaker in the camera is difficult to hear. It has loud midrange and little else, making it sound like a typical drive-through speaker. Don't expect to be able to use this to talk with kids from far away, and it scares the hell out of my cats.* Little adjustability for the motion detection. My cats set off the motion detector constantly, so I can't use it for security or notification about human visitors. Some other cameras allow setting triggers based on the type or amount of motion, while also allow rejecting motion low in the frame to deal with pets.* The website squashes the aspect ratio to 4:3 despite this being a 16:9 aspect camera.* The website disconnects after about half an hour and needs a new login each time. It does not work as a peer-to-peer connection even if on the same network, unlike the mobile app.* There doesn't seem to be any support for third-party camera software, or a way of viewing multiple camera feeds at once without manually opening a bunch of browser windows.Verdict:If you want a cheap temporary surveillance camera that's easy to set up, requires no wires apart from the power cable, and have an existing wi-fi network, this is a decent choice. Don't expect to make good use of this with multi-camera setups, always-on surveillance, two-way communications, or for any other advanced use.Note:I didn't count this as a negative since it's not how most home networks are set up, but I did have some trouble with the wi-fi configuration on a network that had multiple wireless base stations in order to extend range. (An example of this would be multiple Apple Airports, each wired to ethernet, and each configured to broadcast the same SSID and use the same password.) The Belkin app repeatedly failed to configure the network when I would pick the SSID from the network list, where the same SSID was also shown multiple times. Choosing the option to attach it to a \"different network\" and then manually typing the SSID worked. If you have a similar whole-home setup with multiple base stations, this may save you some grief.","rating":3},{"comment":"Overall, I'm pleased with the software and hardware stability of the camera. It's been reliable and I haven't found any major software bugs yet. Setup took me a few minutes using the NetCam app (for iOS) and connecting up to my secured home wi-fi, but the NetCam login works well and I was up seeing images on my iPhone and on my computer's web browser in just a few minutes. Belkin includes basic mounting hardware and a long AC adapter cord, which is handy so you can place the camera wherever you'd like.The picture quality is clear: whether I'm accessing from home or away (and the app still loads the camera pretty quickly, within a few seconds). It does seem to be about 720p quality and there are plenty of easy setting tweaks in the app. Images are shown with about a second delay when you are viewing on a high speed network connection. The app lets you save images\/movies directly to your iOS library. The night vision IR by default is set to automatic - I was impressed by the images in the dark (though black and white, which is a limitation of night vision.)You can also communicate with the audio functions -- which I found surprisingly clear on both ends. By default, the camera sends you email every time motion is detected. I quickly shut this off as I was getting too many false positives. So far I'm not that trusting of the motion detection accuracy. Fortunately, there are options to tweak the motion settings so I'll need to get this just right over time. I haven't tried the WeMo integration (I do have a switch) as I'm waiting to tweak these settings. There's also no remote movement of the camera, but given the wide angle lens, I don't think this is a big deal.There is also the NetCam+ service, may still be in beta, which allows you to store a history of your images. For the price of the camera, this should be included, but yet only found a 30-day trial available to me upon setup and it's not clear what the final price will be. It's obvious that Belkin is trying to imitate theDropcam (DCAM-001-THD) Wi-Fi Wireless Video Monitoring Camera (DCAM-001-THD), which has a similar extended pay service. At least Belkin didn't ask for a credit card for the 30 day trial, but Dropcam offers some limited storage options with their included plan. Without Belkin's plan, there's basically no historical way to go back and see past images. This is main reason I'm docking the camera a star.Note that all my testing of this camera has been indoors and the motion sensing isn't the biggest feature for me, so that is reflecting my somewhat positive review. But for casual in-home use, I've found no problems with the apps or website (unlike other brands) so it gets my general recommendation.","rating":4},{"comment":"This may work really well for you if you are recording indoor and have a good wifi network. The Belkin NetCam App is pretty good. It does have a lot of room for improvement however. I have an iMac and iPhone5 and it took a while to setup. 20 mins or so later I was able to view the cam from my iPhone. The picture quality is pretty good and the sound is only O.K. If this platform continues to evolve and get more refined I can image that it will be very good in the future. It is just that as it is now it takes a bit of time to get into the app and select the right camera and see what is going on. The motion and recording features are the best thing about it. But like the competitors out there they charge a monthly subscription fee for this service. I have a liveline and another PTZ camera that I like better for subscription services. I can pan, tilt and zoom on those. This does work really well for monitoring an entry door and getting snapshots via motion detection. The hardware seems good, hopefully the software will be better soon. Not sure how long this camera will function being left on 24\/7. A couple of years may be all it does with wifi only as its connection.","rating":4},{"comment":"This is a nice, sharp looking little camera. It is very easy to set up and to mount wherever you'd like. Products always are ranked better with me when I have no issues with set up! It is an indoor camera, so I've got mine set up in the living room and have been trying it out while I'm at work. Thought it would be fun to see how often the dog sneaks up on the couch. He does, and it sends me an e-mail alert every time he walks into the living room. The sensitivity is pretty crazy- his tail will barely enter the shot and I'll get an e-mail notification. Or if the air conditioning kicks on and it makes the curtain move a wee bit, I'll get a notification. This is both awesome that it works so well and a little annoying. The audio both in and out works better than I expected and it has a great, clear picture with a wider span of the room than I had anticipated. Overall, really enjoying this camera!","rating":4},{"comment":"If you are going to make an IP camera that only works well with your own app, then PLEASE pay attention to the quality of that app.  There are plenty of cameras out there that work with well designed third-party apps (I've had good luck with Foscam and Lorex).  Belkin, though, insists that you use their apps to set up and manage your cameras, and those apps are clumsy, glitch, and just plain awkward to use.Do yourself a favor before getting this camera: Find the iOS and\/or Android apps that Belkin has created for communicating with this camera.  Take a look at the reviews for those apps.  Then, look up some of the third-party apps that work with cameras from a variety of manufacturers.  There are some great apps out there, none of which will work with Belkin's NetCam.I had an older NetCam (2013 model, I believe), and found it difficult to set up and manage.  I was hoping that this latest version of their camera would come with a better app.  No such luck.  Same clumsy app, with improved camera hardware.To be fair, there are some things I like about the camera:* e-mail notification for motion alert worked very well.  I liked that I could fine-tune the trigger (broad motion, fine motion, repeated motions, and so on)* the image quality was decent because of the HD quality graphics.  However, when set at the highest quality, the video was very choppy.* I like that Belkin will allow you to store captured video on their \"cloud\" automatically, but I was disappointed that this requires a subscription to their service.  Given the cost of this camera, and the fact that I am tied to Belkin's own apps to use it, I would hope that such \"premium\" service would be included.Also, to be fair, I don't have any other WeMo devices installed right now.  Belkin advertises that this works well with those devices (for example, camera motion could be set to trigger your lights to turn on).  I can't speak to how well these features work.In my opinion, Belkin needs to do one of two things: Either create a new app, from the ground up, that is of much better quality than their current app, or \"open up\" the device so that it can be used with existing third-party apps.In the meantime, though, it is hard to recommend this updated NetCam.","rating":2},{"comment":"This Belkin NetCam HD+ camera is an extremely basic camera video quality that is barely 720p - definitely not &#34;HD+&#34;. The basics are all there - IR filter, IR lights, audio and WeMo compatibility. Sadly, the camera itself just isn't that good. When there are comparable products like the many Foscam cameras with active PTZ, 2 Dropcam versions and a variety of Logitech Alert products, there just isn't much room in the market for a mediocre camera like this. The apps are severely lacking, and it requires a &#34;cloud&#34; account just to use, which means it is impossible to setup somewhere without Internet (like a cabin) and use as a local only monitoring camera. Audio is useless, so if you planned to use this at your porch to talk to the mailman, forget it.","rating":3},{"comment":"This camera is fantastic. The setup was very easy. I had a couple of hiccups but it eventually worked. It works great with my iPhone 5. The video quality is excellent. You can even receive emails alerting you that something passed in front of the camera. I turned it off for now because I received about 30 emails in an hour. This camera has a wide angle lens which is very useful. I have a camera from a competing brand and although it works fine, and although it was half the cost, it is also half the quality and the normal lens is very limiting. Place this camera on the end of a big room and you'll see almost everything. This night vision is also excellent. I could see our cat sitting on my favorite chair last night. We'll have to have another talk now that I have proof. You have the option of purchasing memory in the cloud if you want to record view stuff. Lots of great features but the wide angle lens is my favorite.","rating":5},{"comment":"I compared this directly to the Dropcam HD which I setup right next to this.  Both of these camera feed back through company servers and avoid the difficulty I had with earlier ip cameras where you had to modify the software on your modem to open a port.  Only the geeky - est are able to deal with that.While the unit is attractive, it isn't as small and sleek as the dropcam.  The dropcam is black also so it doesn't stand out as much as this white one (depending on your decor.Images are sharp and the image is better in low light conditions.  However, the field of view is significantly less wide angle than the dropcam HD.  I much prefer the dropcam in that regard.  This is likely closer to the regular dropcam.This has good quality mic and speaker.I found the software easy to use.  I like the \"push to talk\" feature in particular.  Neither this unit nor the Dropcam have real time duplexing for the microphone.  On the dropcam, you toggle on the mic and have to quickly turn it off to hear.  On this unit, the mic is only active as long as you are pushing.  I think this makes conversation much easier.I like to watch my dropcam on my computer rather than relying on my cell phone and its batteries.  I have a little window on the edge of my pc screen.  The Belkin only emphasizes use throught the cell phone.  It is hard to find it..but after digging around on the web, I found that you can type in [...] in your browser and it will work.Overall, I am partial to the dropcam but it is just about a tie.","rating":4},{"comment":"Setup was ridiculous it was so easy.  I just love the WeMo products.  This is my third...the other two are simple switches.  They just work.  The setup didn't work exactly as they stated.  I did have a tiny bit of trouble.  But I just kept going, rebooted and everything was working.  The quality of the picture is very good.  I've used it inside and through a window looking outside.  There are not a huge number of settings in the app but that's part of what makes it simple.  And the audio is very impressive on the phone side...better than any camera I have.  The camera side is just okay.With all that why did I give it four starts?  Motion.  It is really bad at displaying motion.  But the farther away the motion is the better it works.  So shooting outside through a window at toward the barnyard works well.  The mounting bracket is a little funky but it works.It's basically a quick, easy camera that is bad at motion","rating":4},{"comment":"I've had the Aukey SuperSpeed for around a week now and have been using it heavily for charging devices\/transferring data from my ever filling laptop's hard drive.The packaging is very simple, nothing wasteful.It has a nice blue LED to let you know it is receiving power and plugged in.Each port is far apart and does not cause any hardships of unplugging the USB cords.The base has 4 rubber feet that helps keep stable on the table.

USB 2.0\/1.1 ports will suffice as well, but won&#8217;t reach the same transfer speeds.&#9654; TestingI tested this product with a benchmarking program called &#8220;CystalDiskMark&#8221; with mySilicon Power Rugged Armor A80. This program tells the speed of storage devices, whether internal or external. During my first test, I accompanied this drive with three other USB flash drives, and received unreliable results (100MB\/s Read, 18MB\/s Write) when my typical results are much higher (100MB\/s Read and Write). For my next test, I used the Silicon Power A80 without any other used ports, and tested highly (111MB\/s Read, 109MB\/s Write). I received results of +11MB\/s Read and +9MB\/s Write from average results. As long as no other USB ports are used, these are above average results.&#9654; Final ThoughtsThis hub is made for users that don&#8217;t use several high powered USB 3.0 devices. As long as those conditions are met, this is definite an excellently constructed hub, performing 9MB\/s above average write speeds. I recommend this product to anyone needing a non-powered USB hub, and give this a 5 star rating.Pros:+ Well crafted from aluminum, well lit, and performed well (9MB\/s above average write speeds).+ Uses vertical ports, allowing much larger USB devices, such as flash drives, being used.Cons:- Doesn&#8217;t use external power, which means several high powered USBs cannot efficiently be used.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.","rating":5},{"comment":"unit arrived on time and packaging was well done and i like the fact that Aukey uses materials that are recyclable which i thought was a great plus. the unit is aluminum and has a great look and feel and nothing flimsy like some other units i have had. unit has 4 usb ports and  one blue LED to notify that the hub is connected to the computer, very simple to use and see that your connected. The port that is used to connect to the computer is on the left hand side while the ports at the top are used to connect peripherals. The bottom also has two non-skid rubber feet at the bottom which i really liked and made unit secure on my table and didn't move around when connecting a hard drive or other usb items.the 2ft usb 3.0 cable provided was plenty of cable but not too much so you don't have extra cable laying all over your workstation and unit itself uses its small size very well also. Package contents: Aukey 4-Port Hub, 2FT USB 3.0 Cable, Instruction Manual. Free lifetime technical support and 18 months warranty. the free technical  support was a nice added touch you dont get with alot of other retailers and one i liked to see. data transfer rates of up to 5Gbps, you'll be able to sync files and interact with your Mac or PC more efficiently than ever; backwards compatibility with USB 2.0 \/ 1.1. overall i loved the simple design and great looking unit and highly recommend this product.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a great way to increase your USB 3.0 ports, while adding USB to your android phone.The hub is made of aluminum, which makes it sturdy but light. In the hand it has a nice feel, the metal body gives it a premium touch. The cord is nice and thick, and just the right length.One of the best features is that it does not require a power adapter, unlike others on the market. All you have to do is plug the hub into any USB 3.0 port. Once plugged into the computer, the driver will automatically install, it is \"Plug & Play\". Now you will be able to transfer data up to 5Gbps. Since having this, I am able to expand my limited number of USB 3.0 ports.This hub will also work in a USB 2.0\/1.1 port, but with decreased speed. You can use the hub everything from a flash drive to an external hard drive, or anything that has a USB port.I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.","rating":5},{"comment":"*PackagingThe Metal hub came in a simple enough package.  Minimalistic and green.  Green in that all materials are recyclable.  Which is a definite plus in my book.*Build Quality\/PerformanceHolding the hub is hand has a very nice\/sturdy feel to it.  Nothing seemed flimsy or cheap.  No excessive bending or creaking when applying pressure on the hub.  Definitely feels like a premium product.It has a very simple\/minimal design to it.  Mostly of aluminum silver metal and a soft white plastic at the bottom.  The aluminum isn't a glossy shiny finish but more of a matte finish.  Which I prefer.  It has one blue LED to notify that the hub is connected to the computer.  The port that is used to connect to the computer is on the left hand side while the ports at the top are used to connect peripherals.  The bottom also has two non-skid rubber feet at the bottom.  Which is great thing as I hate it when hubs or accessories move around when trying to use them.  Simple and elegant enough design.  It definitely has some Apple-ish design cues.It has a very small footprint so it won't take up too much space of your work area.  Huge plus to me and it has no wasted space on it.Comparing the speed of the hub to directly in the usb 3.0 port there were little if any difference in real world testing and according to Crystal disk mark. (see attached photos).  So the hub definitely doesn't bottleneck the usb 3.0 port.Peripheral devices do work on this hub.  There are other hubs that doesn't play well with peripherals such as logitech mice or keyboards.  This hub definitely works with my Logitech MX anywhere mouse and logitech keyboard.*ConclusionFor a simple, non-powered usb 3.0 hub I don't think it can get much better.  Definitely worth buying for a minimal, compact USB 3.0 hub.","rating":5},{"comment":"Aukey continues to amaze me with their great quality products. This aluminum hub is what most business folks like me desire. We want:Well-designed product: This hub has round corners, and very stylish.

Easy to use, just like a normal USB port on the computer but extended out more. It has a 2ft cable so you can get it closer to you. But the 2ft was a little short for me, so I had to buy a extension cable and hook it up but it still works amazing!! Fast Transfer speed, up to 5GBps!! Also the  backwards compatibility with USB 2.0 \/ 1.1 was great too because most of the things that I owe are USB 2.0. It has a LED Indicator that tells you that it is plugged into the computer and working. Has 2 long pads on the bottom of the hub that keeps it from moving around on your desk.

The Desktop computer came equiped generously with one USB 3.0 port on the back. Which is at best inconvenient to move the chasis case around and peer back there with a flashlight and then snake a cable in among the already affixed wires to plug into the lone USB3. Now that various periferals are starting to show up on the market that use the USB3 standard it is terribly inconvenient to gain access to the rear of the desktop case on every occassion I need that USB3 port.With the M3H4 Hub I now have four USB3 ports conveniently placed on the desktop in front of the monitor instantly ready for Whichever session is needed.

Love the illuminated blue LED once the hub is connected to the computer, and the rubber \"feet\" make it stay pretty stable on my desk. As with other products from Aukey, there is also great attention paid to the packaging.If you don't need an active USB port (with its own power connection), then I would definitely recommend this passive hub.Disclaimer: I have been provided with a review unit for the product in order to share a fair and honest review.","rating":5},{"comment":"I was supplied a sample unit for testing and I promised a fair and honest review.

I have been assembling the necessary components for a Raspberry Pi computer that I planned to use to connect my television to the internet. We used a WebTV for more than 15 years and surfing the 'net is frequently much more relaxing from a recliner than at my computer. The main thing with the Raspberry Pi was being able to use my tv as I had used the WebTV. The internet for eMails, ordering from Amazon and eBay, etc. I had planned to purchase a small keyboard but that has limitations. This Logitech reminds me of the WebTV wireless keyboards but with a touchpad added. I will no longer have an excuse not to get my project underway now! Meanwhile, it is serving as a remote control for my tv and dvd player. I like the feel of the keys. As I progress, I'll update this review. One thing you want to be sure to do if you are considering purchasing this smart keyboard is to make sure your intended devices will function with it otherwise you might end up with nothing more than a high-tech remote control.","rating":5},{"comment":"Although compact, the Harmony keyboard has well spaced keys and is easy to type on. The touchpad works better than my couple year old Logitech pad, so they've made improvements there.  I prefer the smaller size and this would be my standard go to keyboard if it only had a keypad.There seems to be room for a keypad if they moved the Harmony logo to the middle and moved the touchpad up with smaller buttons. You'd expect a tv remote to have a group of number keys in one configuration or another. Having a keypad would also allow better placement of multi-function keys.I was able to use the Harmony hub from two rooms away. I didn't need the plug in antenna. There is also an extender for the usb receiver that makes it a little over an inch long. Using the receiver adds an almost imperceptible lag to keystrokes.  Having the Harmony hub  2 rooms away  caused keystrokes to intermittently duplicate or stick. It's best to have the hub as close as possible.The keyboard looks sturdy but there's no protection for the keys if you drop it. There is also no on\/off switch.  You could probably drop it several times with no ill effects except for keys being inadvertently pressed.Logitech pointing devices have a universal receiver. After a certain date only one usb receiver is needed and it will handle any Logitech product.  Harmony is a different division of Logitech and the pointing devices don't work with the Harmony usb receiver.The keyboard comes with two usb receivers so you can set it up with two devices. I couldn't find any way to switch between the devices without unplugging one of the receivers or turning 1 device off. As far as I can tell the first device turned on is the device that is controlled.This is a great product. For me, the keyboard not having a keypad means it will be in the closet more than it will be in use.","rating":5},{"comment":"Easy instructions, great tool. Now controlling every device I have.

I have set it up to control my TV, TiVo, Bluray, WDTV, Soundbar and everything in between! This thing can even be controlled via your iPhone\/iPod!! Setup was easy as pie, It literally took 2 minutes!I've found myself watching more Netflix & Youtube on my smart tv now that I can type fast and it isn't so cumbersome to look something up! Even typing in a show to find on the TiVo takes only a second compared to almost a minute using arrow keys and spelling something out on the traditional remote control!This thing even has a trackpad and mouse clicking buttons so if you're TV has a mouse function like my LG 3D TV does it will even work for that and you will honestly feel like you have a huge computer with full functionality in you're entertainment center! If you watch alot of streaming TV or are looking for the best input device for your media then look no further, This is the greatest thing since sliced bread! Oh who am I kidding, This is even better than sliced bread!!","rating":5},{"comment":"The Smart Keyboard solves a handful of problems well enough that its shortcomings are acutely frustrating.The core of the system is the Harmony Hub. It blasts IR like any other Harmony remote, it pairs with Bluetooth devices such as a PC, a Playstation, or an AppleTV, and it comes with two USB receivers that receive keyboard and mouse signals for devices that support USB input devices.It connects to your Wifi network and syncs with a configuration profile associated with your account on myharmony.com, which you are required to create. The mobile app also syncs with this account, which happens to allow you to control the system from anywhere you have internet access.The mobile app is required to configure the system. It connects directly to the Hub to configure the Hub's wifi connection. Configuration then proceeds online. There is no desktop or web-based interface.The physical keyboard connects to the hub using a Logitech RF protocol.&#34;Hub&#34; describes it nicely. It takes commands from the network or the keyboard, and relays them to whatever device is in use, using whatever interface is best for communicating with that device. It does a good job at this, for the things it is capable of doing.A Smart Remote cannot be paired with the Hub together with a Smart Keyboard. One Hub, one controller. That obvious application is, for now, one of many opportunities open to this system.Setup was fine. A lot of work has gone into the Harmony way of doing things, and it shows. The mobile app is easy enough to use. The first-run wizard gets you to a working system.The wizard forces you to turn devices on and off throughout the process, so it isn't something you can do while actually watching TV. You'll have to set aside some time to do this. If you have a projection display, brace yourself for some jarring and unnecessarily-abusive power cycling on your lamp. And once you've got everything complete and are ready to watch something, everything will be shut off. You'll have to turn everything right back on again to use it. There's probably some good reason for all this.This system uses a variety of approaches to control a variety of tricky components, and the results are accordingly inconsistent. Adjustable delays and repeats are valuable, but adjusting them and testing the results involves a lot of tapping and a lot of waiting. If your device requires multi-step control sequences, Harmony can handle it, but customizing the delays on that device might clobber the hacks that come from the database, and you can't recreate the hacks yourself.Macros are available, but only as sequences of commands attached to keys. Sequences can be mapped only to selected transport, navigation, and F-keys. You can map a sequence to a soft key in an Activity screen, but you have to map the sequence first to a key. Sequence mappings vary by Activity, so you can't make a sequence available across all activities. The range of actions you can use in Sequences is limited to device commands. Sequences cannot send keystrokes or trackpad gestures.In the kit I received from Logitech, the USB receiver labeled &#34;1&#34; responds as receiver 2, and vice-versa. If the units are pre-paired at the factory, these were paired incorrectly. If they are secretly paired during the setup process, I may have screwed it up. Either way, this maddening flaw would have driven me to return the whole system if a forum user hadn't observed the same behavior and shared the findings, and if Logitech support had responded any more quickly about my RMA request. I would like to have sent it back anyway so that their systems would have counted the defect, but Logitech didn't care to be bothered, and by that point, neither really could I.I did, after all, get it working, and I do, in the end, enjoy using it. I like having one device to handle all my components, keyboard and trackpad included. The mobile app is nice. I think my family and my guests can figure it out. I wish I could connect more controllers to it, and I wish I had more control in software. It's very frustrating, because this hardware has everything it needs to do everything most modern living rooms need, if the software were more open and more flexible. Laughably out of the question are web hooks or a scripting language. I just want macros and keystrokes, and some way to tweak the device-specific magic spells. Instead, I have to be careful not to break them.With any luck, this has some forward momentum, and will continue to evolve and improve. This is a great start.","rating":4},{"comment":"I received the Logitech Harmony Keyboard for review via the Amazon Vine program. We immediately fell in love with this product. The Harmony system allows you to control all of your audio and video components from one keyboard instead of multiple remotes.  Even better, you can control everything from the free harmony phone or iPad app. We installed the app on both Android and iOS devices and had the same great results with both operating systems. I thought the set up would be difficult and time consuming, but all I did was enter the brand and model of each component into the phone app, and they all worked without any additional configuring.We are using the device with a television, blue ray, stereo receiver, Apple TV, and cable box.The real power of Harmony is that you can program in an activity like &#34;watch Apple TV&#34;and it allows you to specify which components need to be on and to which settings. So now when I hit one button, on my iPhone or android or the Harmony  keyboard, it powers on the television, stereo, and Apple TV, all with the correct input settings, ready to watch.  The real most powerful component of this product in our home is the hub that communicates with and ties together the components by bluetooth, wifi, and infrared as needed.  I will mainly use the phone app to control everything rather than the keyboard. No more remotes all over the table!","rating":5},{"comment":"This is not my first Logitech Harmony controller, it is by far the best, so there is a steady improvement in the product.  It was very easy to set up, and works very reliably.  A TV and sound system that had previously caused endless grief with previous universal remotes finally worked, but the problem is that it takes almost 30 seconds to turn everything on.  If I use the individual controllers the TV and cable turn on much faster.  It may be because my Samsung sound system takes a while to start up and the controller turns the TV on at the same rate, but it is annoying.  In addition my Sound System and TV osed Samsung's AnyNet feature that allowed them to be turned on simultaneously.  This had to be disabled for the Logitech controller to work.I had never used a keyboard controller before, it actually has some use, but is not a one handed device.  Using the App on my iphone day to day was basically useless in my opinion, though it made setup a breeze.","rating":4},{"comment":"Easy to set up, works great. I don't like that there is not number pad to the right of the keyboard though. Might not be great for gamers in that respect.","rating":4},{"comment":"This could be a really great, convenient item to have, which is why I ordered it.  When searching my DVR or Netflix through my Blu-Ray player, I'm always wishing there was an easier way to type.  Behold, a smart keyboard.  Lo, the smart keyboard works neither with my DVR nor my Blu-Ray player rendering it worthless for me.The &#34;remote control' aspect of it works great.  Set up was easy - downloading the app from the app store, and getting everything connected couldn't have been more simple (make sure you have your wireless password handy, mine happened to be on my phone so that wasn't very handy).  The keyboard does function perfectly to turn on and off the TV or TV and Blu-Ray, etc.  I personally don't need a keyboard sized remote control.I understand that the typing aspect works on:  Smart TVs, Apple TV, ROKU, TiVo, PS3, PS4, Xbox.  But do yourself a favor, and check the list of compatible devices on the Logitech website before ordering.  If your devices don't work with the keyboard, a regular Harmony remote would probably be the better bet.","rating":3},{"comment":"This is an amazing piece of equipment.  I was somewhat intimated when I first received it.  I wasn't sure if I would be able to hook it up. It seemed overwhelming at first.  However, installation was so very simple. I just plugged in the Harmony Hub and connected one of the USB receivers to the back of my Smart TV. I instantly had control of all the functions on the television through this one device. Prior to using this keyboard I had a hand held remote that I would use to surf the internet on the TV.  I found it annoying to have to type in words one letter at a time. With this device, not only can I easily type in the name of the movie or the song  that I'm looking for, I can get on Google Docs, and  write books or anything I need to do.  Being a writer I liked that feature. It's nice to lay on the bed and let my writing skills go wild.I did not hook up Direct TV, even though you can, because I like having a separate remote for that. I did hook up my DVD player, and was able to watch movies at the push of a button. I found the mouse pad on the keyboard easier to control than the remote mouse. One important revelation with this product.  I never have to worry about losing the remote control again. The Technology is amazing.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is an excellent pair of wireless headphones, including a microphone, and seems quite durable for all kinds of sports activities (except maybe swimming) and best of all can be used by those of us who prefer them for desk or laptop computers.The volume controls are easy to work, the sound quality is quite fine, and the batteries hold a charge for hours, (unlike some of our older model phones).The unit also comes with three varied sized ear bud pieces, to accommodate a wide range of ear sizes. My ears are very small, those of my partner are huge. The buds fit both of us.One attractive extra for those who actually buy the item: since the company borrowed the product label from the cetaceans of the same name, for every unit sold it donates $1 to the nonprofit research, education and wildlife conservation Whaleman Foundation. Clearly that in itself is not reason to buy these ear buds, but it's something l'd have appreciated had I purchased the unit rather than obtaining my pair free from Amazon Vine.I like these ear buds very much and recommend them highly.","rating":5},{"comment":"First of all, you have to love a company that uses an image of Bigfoot from the famous Patterson-Gimlin footage as their company logo - that is brilliant! Even better yet, they give you two stickers of their logo when you buy their products.This is my very first pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds, and Outdoor Technologies Orcas Earbuds were very easy to pair with my iPhone. On my initial listen I found them to provide a very pleasant sound without much ear fatigue with extended listening.While the range of the ear buds seems great indoors while the iPhone is on the table, it tends to vary a little while moving about. It seemed to be necessary to put my iPhone in my right pants pocket while going on a walk (I usually keep it on the left), since it appears that the Bluetooth radio is on this side. The charging jack, LED, and multifunction switch are all on this side, so it would make sense that the radio would be there. If I put my iPhone in the left pocket, the signal tended to drop out often, so placement of the device is important. While moving about, the occasional split second drop out will always occur, but that is ok.The \"cans\" of the earbuds stick out a little bit that give them a little more weight than standard wired ones, so sometimes moving about will dislodge them from the ears a little more. A little twist puts them back in place, or, you can use the \"fins\" that Outdoor Technologies supplies to sort of \"lock\" the buds in place in your ear.  I found those to get a little bit uncomfortable after a while, so I tend not to use them. Joggers and runners may find it necessary to use the fins to keep the buds secure - but no pain no gain, right? Outdoor Technologies supplies 3 sizes of silicon tips and two sizes of fins to try and get the fit just right. Most people will wear the Orcas with the cord going behind their neck. Here's a warning for those with a fat neck, when sweaty, the cord gets stuck to your neck and it feels like the earbuds will come out of your ears if you turn your head. This is due to the silicon coating on the wire. I just want to proclaim that it is perfectly acceptable to wear the cord in the front, and I wear them that way most of the time. So, don't be embarrassed to wear them like that.The noise isolation on the Orcas is terrific. I mowed the lawn with these things and barely heard the lawnmower at all. The multifunctional switch allows the user to adjust the volume, pause, skip tracks, answer calls, and even call up Siri.The general sound is just the way I like headphones to be, deep clear bass, clear crisp highs with a well-defined breathy feel to them. While they may not meet the standards of audiophiles, the average listener will not be disappointed by the sound the Orcas put out. For some reason Outdoor Technologies does not provide the frequency response of the Orcas in their documentation or on their website. I'd be curious to see what it is.While I don't usually use a headset while talking on the phone, I tested out the earbuds and found the quality about average - A far cry from the music's sound quality. I even left myself a voicemail to hear how I would sound to other callers and found my voice a little garbled, but understandable. Maybe all headsets sound that way? I don't really know. I usually just use the handset.Overall, the Orcas are a nice product. They sound great, have a great battery life, and can be used for just about any activity without getting tangled up in wires. Oh, and you get a little carry bag with their logo screened on it to take on trips or just store them in.","rating":4},{"comment":"These are pretty cool! The first thing I noticed, however, was how hard it was to see the little blue light that indicated the headphones are 'on'. It's a very teeny little light on the underside of one of the earbuds. It's almost easier to just pop in the headphones, turn them on and wait for the audible beep.I forgot to put in the &#34;fins&#34;, so that probably explains why every time I touched them to adjust the volume, they felt like they were going to fall out. So, yeah. Put the &#34;fins&#34; on\/in. And make sure you select the right size of rubber tips.The sound is good: people can hear me just fine and I can hear them just fine. The only time I had someone complain about the sound quality was when I was calling from my car on the interstate. I think the ambient road noise was a bit much and caused the other person to struggle to hear me. Listening to music was a much better experience - no issues there. Sound is good and the noise cancelling works quite well.I found that taking\/making a call with both earbuds in was very... uncomfortable. Since they are noise-cancelling headphones, it's odd to hear your voice when both of your ears are plugged. So, when I was on calls, I would just put one earbud in and leave the other one dangling.I love that these are relatively &#34;cordless&#34; - meaning, they're not attached to your phone. I chose to wrap them around the back of my head and didn't have any difficulty adjusting the sound. The volume up\/down and &#34;call&#34; button are pretty close together on the cord, so you'll have to feel for them, but the middle &#34;call&#34; button is more raised, so you should be able to make adjustments without struggling too much.Overall, I really like them and they've proved to be a valuable device to have when roaming around the house and yard and making calls. I wouldn't hesistate to recommend these!","rating":4},{"comment":"I am conflicted writing this because right now, these exemplary earbuds aren't working for me.Not because they don't work, they are just not working for me.I have a Samsung Note 2 that pairing with was crazy easy (hold down the button until the light under the right earbud starts flashing intermittent blue and red and that's it!) The sound was super, terrific, handling everything from hiphop to Audible books. There were a few warning signs, I now realize, when the sound quality would dip horrendously low as I walked--yes, just walked, with the phone attached to my belt--almost as if line-of-sight between the phone and the earbuds were required. That's nonsensical, I thought. These things are supposed to be good for at least 30ft!I especially loved the earbuds in the gym (note: when you're squatting with a bar across your shoulders, move the wire to the front!) where freedom of movement was exquisite. The ear fit, secured with the included plastic fins, was secure and  held fast usually although I found it seemed easy for those little black fins to pop off the ear buds so be careful. With three bud sizes, and two sizes of fins, some combination ought to work for the most. In my case, my left ear required a small bud to fit properly while the right went the medium route. Whatever.I was never afraid of sweat, everything's positively encased with a black rubbery veneer and full charging took about an hour or so via the included USB cable. I would have liked a quick way of verifying how much charge there is left because the only warning I had of low power was when it unceremoniously cut off.And then my heart broke. I had to hold the Samsung phone almost to my ear in order for the earbuds to work otherwise the pop-pop sound of a lost Bluetooth connection sounded constantly. I restarted the phone, broke and reset the Bluetooth connection, nothing. To make sure it wasn't the Orcas causing the problem, I connected them to my Dell laptop and the sweetest, strongest sounds flowed through them. Same with my wife's Samsung S5, no problem.And so, they're now lying unused on my bedside table, the dream shattered. So, 0 stars for the Orca earbuds now, but 5 excellent stars for when they worked.(I reached out to Outdoor Technologies and was told to send an email for support. I did, and so far&#8212;2 days&#8212;no replies.)","rating":5},{"comment":"This really is a great idea without all the muss and fuss of wires hanging out of my shirt when I workout and having to keep my iPhone in my shorts pockets or strapped to my arm. Now, I can leave my iPhone over by my bag 30 feet away and not have to mess with falling out of shorts pockets every time I lay down to do an exercise. I forget what the range of these earbuds are(I think it's about 35 ft.) once it's been synced, but even if you're going further than that and you don't want to keep your phone on you all you have to do is lay it down wherever you're going to be exercising.I had no issues syncing my iPhone to these earbuds. They are pretty much a perfect fit for my ears and rather comfortable. Most of the time I don't even know they are in there. Once I have these in my ears I tuck the short cord down the front of my shirt and no more cords in the way. Occasionally I will have to pull the cord up(or reach under my shirt) to adjust the volume. They say these are water resistant and I would say I believe that. I do high intensity 2 hour workouts 4-5 days a week and I'm usually drenched in sweat mid-way through the workout, so considering these cords are planted next to my torso the entire time, being soaked in sweat, I'd say they hold up well to water.The earbuds stay in my ears for the entire duration of my workout without coming out at all. My main gripes(which are small) with these Outdoor Tech Wireless Earbuds is the sound quality and the charge. The sound quality is not bad. In fact, the highs are quite good. But I thought the bass was a bit lacking. The charge is supposed to last 6 hours and that seems a bit off to me because after 5 hours of use they die on me. It is a bit annoying to someone like me, who is a gym rat, to have to charge these every 2 days or so. Fortunately, they recharge in about an hour.Overall, though you can't go wrong with these Outdoor Tech earbuds. They are durable and the sound is solid overall. But best of all is they are ingenious: No more unsightly, annoying wires in your way and no more carrying the phone around in your pocket. I actually hate bringing a phone in the gym, unless I'm going to leave it over by my bag and leave it alone, because if I carry it around with me in my hand or pocket I always want to play around with it, which negates my workout at times. No more of that, now!","rating":4},{"comment":"While the pairing process was simple, and the ability to make calls went smoothly, the sound quality was sub-par. One might expect this level of quality in a $10 headphone.Here's why:-The volume tops out at somewhere in the 80 decibel range, which is not a lot. It would be fine for background listening in a quiet environment, but if you want to listen to music loudly, which many people might, or if you are dealing with lots of background noise, then it's not even remotely adequate.-Does nothing for treble or bass. Everything sounds right around the middle, flattening out most music.-Lacks detail. You don't hear the quieter elements in music, and it does not pick up on individual parts. Fuzzy.I wouldn't buy these. Bluetooth headsets can be very hit or miss. While it was user-friendly, this was mostly a miss.","rating":3},{"comment":"Pros:1. Wireless BT works great. 35 plus feet. I've tested using in another room from my phone about 30 feet with the door closed. Did not drop the signal.2. Noise isolation is very good. Can't hear my kids yelling and the dog barking.3. Quality of sound is very good. Bass is good.5. Charge lasts at least 4 hours from my testing. They will last longer but I have not tested beyond that. They recharge in about an hour or so. Standard USB connector for charging is good. So I can use other cables if need be.4. Fit works very well after getting used to putting them on. They do not fall off during jogging or other high motion exercises.6. BT connects automatically after first setup. My other BT headphones do not and it's an extra painful step that these allow me to skip.Cons:1. Fit gets to be uncomfortable after longer uses. This is acceptable, as these need to be secure in your ear so they don't fall out while moving around or exercising. I would not recommend if you will be using for longer periods of time, as comfort will probably be an issue. Not as much a Con on the product but the type of headphone.2. Profile could be a bit smaller. They sick out a bit far but not any more than other BT headphones I've seen. I would have liked to wear these under my motorcycle helmet but they stick out too far.","rating":5},{"comment":"My first concern when working with bluetooth accessories is whether they pair easy or not. I had no problem pairing these with my iPhone 5C. It worked on the first try. These were also easy to charge on my computer using the provided USB charger. It also says you can use a plugin charger, but it doesn't come with the earbuds.These sound fine. Not exceptional, but good and voice calls are clear. I always think cordless headphones are a little weird because they stick out of the ear a bit, but they aren't really noticeable. I haven't gotten these moist so i don't know how well the sweat proof feature works, but overall these are decent cordless headphones.They come with some extra covers and fins, so they can fit in any ear, and a little case for all of the accessories and the manual. The box says there is a 32 range, but I can only get about 5 feet past my porch and I lose the signal. Maybe the blue tooth has to be unobstructed. I can walk all over my apartment and listen to music with the earbuds, while my phone is on my desk.","rating":5},{"comment":"First off these were an upgrade from my wired &#34;over the ear&#34; style earbuds, I got these primarily to use when I am jogging and I really like them for that, but I've found myself using them more and more like when I'm prepping veggies for dinner and folding laundry etc... anything that requires the use of 2 hands!Some people said that after about 4 hours (BTW, the average time they hold a charge I've found is about 5 hours, not the 6 ) they start hurting their ears, I have never used them that long at one shot but at about 3 hours use I did not feel any discomfort, maybe they are one of those people that the earpiece selection just misses a size best for them and they had to opt for a slightly tighter fit than risk going too loose and having them fall out.Just call me &#34;Goldilocks&#34; with the 3 earpieces, as mine fit &#34;just right&#34;!All the controls are easy to use, they come with the usb charger and they have the ability to pair with a wall charger but it is not included. Most people prefer the usb anyways, but it is nice to have that option for the few that want it.Other than the fact that the mic does not have the option to be turned off, I would say they just about thought of everything! I gave it 4 stars because of that issue. It really bugs me to hear myself, when I get winded after sprinting and am breathing heavy..","rating":4},{"comment":"OK, I was skeptical that these could work well enough that I'd want to use them for more than the evaluation but, to my surprise, they do work that well. In fact, I'm listening to Internet radio playing on an iPad over 30 feet (9 m) away as I write this.This system consists of two earbuds connected by a wire with a tiny control center \/ microphone near the right earbud. If you look at the picture, the heavy area in the connecting wire is the control center \/ microphone.The earbuds come with three different butyl rubber earpieces of different sizes (S, M, L). Unique in my experience to these buds, they also have 'orcas' which are soft 'rubber' fin-like things which fit around the buds. These 'orcas' swivel on the buds allowing you to optionally hook them into the ridges making up your ear.I found these orcas made it possible for me to wear the buds because I'm one of those unfortunates whose ear canals are too shallow to retain buds for more than a few seconds. The slight added retention afforded by he orcas make this system, if not secure in my ear, at least solid enough that I can walk around without the buds dropping out as is the case with all other pure ear buds.Pairing the earbuds was quick and easy. They charge using a supplied USB to USB mini cable but there is no charger included. The controls allow summoning Siri for Apple devices and controlling volume and track for all.The quality of the sound is more than good enough for phone calls.  No, these aren't reference grade buds but they do work well enough to enjoy music ripped at a sample rate of 256 kbps. They are just fine for streaming Internet radio.There are two issues, however. While the orcas are an innovative idea for earbud retention, they aren't nearly as good as over the ear retainers such as many athletic earbud setups use. The orcas only weakly add to the retention meaning the earbud rubber needs to exert pressure on the ear canal for the balance of the retention solution but this pressure grows weary after a few hours use. The over the ear buds, by contrast, can be worn all day without any strain on the ears.The other issue is the microphone which doesn't shut off. So when using these earbuds you are aware of your own breathing and also your voice should you speak while wearing them. The good side of this is that you are aware of sounds around you with the earbuds in due to the mic picking up any and all sounds. I can, for example, hear my typing as I write this while I'd not using earbuds lacking an always on mic.Aside from these minor reservations, and the always on mic may be a feature, these almost weightless earbuds are pleasant and easy to use. Recommended.","rating":4},{"comment":"Everyone who has seen us using these very cool earbuds has remarked on what a fantastic idea they are!  My son has recently gotten into jogging, and before we ever got the chance to review these, commented that the wires for his headphones constantly bugged him during his runs.  He was thrilled to try these.  They are terrific!  We very easily connected to all Bluetooth phones we tried and got a wonderfully clear sound.  They changed quickly and stay charged longer than even advertised.  It charges with a micro-USB, the same thing that non-Apple phones use.These came with three different buds and two different &#34;fins&#34;.  This was great for two different people using these, and also because it took trying a few to find the one that my son liked.All the buttons on these worked well, so you can do things like pause the music to answer calls or go to the next song in your list easily.  The microphone that is built-in worked well.  These even worked for answering Skype voice calls!  The range in the Bluetooth is good.  We tested it at up to 30 feet.Overall, these met our expectations.  A very cool concept, done well!","rating":5},{"comment":"Yes, I know that the product description says that these are earbuds, which they are indeed, but the Orcas by Outdoor Tech performs as well as any headset. It contains a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery and a microphone. It also have manual controls too. And it pairs easily via Bluetooth to any device with this type of connectivity.It comes with a few of sets of different size of ear buds rubber pieces and fins, it took some trial and error to find the right combination for my ears. It's worthy, because the quality of the sound it's pretty good, and the Bluetooth signal is steady.I've been using it with my Smartphone to answer calls and listening to music. It works pretty well, and my only complain is that if I'm sweating, the cord sticks to the back of my neck and it pulls the earbuds down. In the end, I solved it by using a hair pin to attach it to the back of my hair while I'm exercising.I have mixed feelings about the alarming beep it emits every time I stepped out of the Bluetooth signal range. It's good to know I walked too far, but it's also annoying. For instance, when I'm at home, and I walked from a room to another, it starts beeping and I'm sure that the distance between my Smartphone and me wearing the earbuds, it not the maximum range. But since the idea is to have the device connected to it on one's body, this is a minor issue. Knowing the connection is being lost, it's a good feature in general.","rating":4},{"comment":"I've been using these Bluetooth earbuds nearly every day for a month now, and I like them a lot. And while a month certainly isn't a great deal of time, so far they have worked well, and without issue.They come with three sets of different size rubber tips\/pads, and two sets of different size \"fins\" to custom fit them to your ears. I chose to use the middle size rubber tips, and the large fins. For me, this arrangement held them in my ears very securely, even when doing quite a bit of physical activity. I also found them to be quite comfortable, even when I've had them in for three or four hours.Outdoor Tech claims the Bluetooth range is thirty-two feet, and that number is actually pretty accurate. However, they also claim the battery play\/talk time is six hours, and I found that number to be a bit exaggerated. I'm getting much closer to five hours of use on a full charge.I haven't owned a lot of Bluetooth earbuds, but I have listened to quite a few pairs, and of the ones I've listened to and owned, these do sound the best. They sound terrific. Very nice highs, nice midrange, and good bass. They don't sound anywhere near as good as my over-ear Sennheiser HD 650s, and I didn't expect them to, but for on-the-go earbuds, they do sound excellent.As you likely know, these Bluetooth earbuds have a built-in in-line microphone, which gives you the ability to use them for phone calls. However, in my opinion, you should consider that nothing more than a nice bonus feature. The overall quality of that feature is lacking when compared to a traditional Bluetooth headset, and you should use a traditional Bluetooth headset if you're wanting something primarily for phone calls.These Bluetooth earbuds currently cost $100, and at that price I think they're definitely worth considering. There are certainly cheaper Bluetooth earbuds out there, but these earbuds sound terrific, work well, and so far they seem to be handling moisture\/sweat much better than any other Bluetooth earbuds I've owned. Consequently, I do recommend these earbuds. Give them a try. I'm confident you'll be happy with them.If you have any questions about these earbuds, please feel free to ask, and I'll do my very best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful.","rating":4},{"comment":"Aw..  the logo sticker enclosed is a very dull standard &#34;intel&#34; type sticker.

I mean, I kicked the habit, but like a junkie I started reading the articles and I see the higher base clock and smoother power delivery, improved thermal interface material and lower temps and in a dream state, I placed an order. Through the gauzy haze of the evening sky, one dusty footstep succeeding the next, I entered...The Devil's Canyon. Did your lights just flicker too?Next thing I know I have packages arriving and out pops aMSI Z97M,16 GB of Kingston 2400 Mhz RAMa Hyper 212 EVO along with aSanDisk Extreme Pro SSDamong all the rest of it. It may be time to remove that credit card information, so I have to enter it to make a purchase.I spent $1050 using aCooler Master N200 caseand anAntec High Current 620W, case fan and wireless along with what I mentioned earlier, which altogether might be $50 cheaper today, you know how that goes. I already had the video card and I'm skipping the optical drive, I'll go external for storage, not wanting the extra heat.I was overclocking back when we used aquarium pumps and chests full of ice water for cooling our CPU's, strange days, but I haven't been for about a decade, so call me an old newb (on second thought, don't ever call anybody that), but I've tried to catch up with LOTS of research.I wanted to be reasonable and still end up with something that would humiliate the 3.4\/up to 3.9 GHz 4770 plus SSD I'm using with a GTX 660 Ti. That upgrade did little to impress me over Sandy bridge, in all this recent research I've done, I found out that the 4770 only runs 3.7 GHz on all four cores according to Intel. But the 4790K's turbo runs two cores at 4.4 GHz, four cores at 4.2 GHz and all four can be clocked 4.4 or higher, like the four barrel and four speed in a Olds 442. Face it guys, if we could drive our computers to the local drive in, park and open the hood like it was the 1960's, we would.Enough silly nostalgic similes, I want to tell you what happened!I received a recent creation being batch # L419B650 or Malay\/2014\/week 19\/B650. Using it the first day I left it stock and it was weird to be shutting down my computer, but I believe a proper break in requires allowing it to cool and run at operating temperature. Then I did the full burn in and all my heatsinks are sunk.I first used just the auto overclock and it was stable at 4.5 GHz, I didn't expect the top overclock using a mid priced micro and air. I would of used water cooling if needed, but if the temps are better with this chip and they seem to be, then maybe it's not, it is one of it's selling points after all. After just a little adjusting I'm seeing 4.7 GHz on all 4 cores with improved RAM timings and I feel like I got a free NOS kit. That's 500 MHz over stock and a 21% faster clock speed than a 4770 and add in the faster RAM and faster SSD and...BAM, I've kicked it up a notch. Remember that on four cores you're starting at 4.2, not 4.4 GHz. It will run Sandra's burn in over and over and Intel's ETU stress test, so I feel it's stable. It's easier to pass the Intel test.That Intel Extreme Tuning Utility is really something, you can start playing after dinner and the next thing you know, you smell breakfast cooking. You will want to save your profile in the BIOS anyway, but it shows default and your changes highlighted in an easy to see way.I think I might hit 4.8 with some more time, but maybe not, trying is the fun part after all and I've only restarted it 60 or 70 times. The temps are okay at 80 degrees max and I haven't tried anything to lower them yet so I can up the voltage beyond 1.26, my room is a cool 70.5 degrees F. I've found that just re-installing the heatsink a few times might lower them 5 degrees, because the best install is rarely the first try. Maybe I'll try a second fan on that big ol' rad he ate her. The rated max temp on this chip is 72.72 degrees but I'll never stress it for long. It idles at 29 degrees.I almost went with a 4930K\/2011 setup but I'm happy I didn't. Sure, it'll do more arithmetic, but for those chores you should really step up to dual Xeon, this processor is the heart of a relatively inexpensive, high end, everyday desktop\/gaming machine. With the M.2 port on the Z97 boards we may soon see much faster SSD's and that will be another kick in the pants for this system. The Extreme Pro is a very fast SSD though, Extremely.So far, this chip's a winner and thorough annihilation of the pitiful 4770 4-cylinder..ah..core..has surely been accomplished by this old hot rodder\/modder. After reading 20 or more tech site articles (some with multiple chips) they show 4.6 to 4.8 as being the most common clock speeds achieved, with one reaching 4.85 and one 4.9 (as of today) and the individual chip being the most likely factor for it. I've read in forums that about 1 in 5 are reaching 5 GHz, but I haven't seen this at the sites where the overclock is registered for competition. Also from what I'm seeing, it seems like the newer chips, from the batch # are clocking faster, that might be something to investigate because in the past that has happened, today there isn't enough data to form a conclusion though. Another thing that I'm curious about, is that like some online reports I've read I can bump it up higher and it seems fine, but won't boot to Windows. Could the newness of Z97 be the problem and will BIOS and driver updates improve this? My MSI has had two BIOS revisions in 40 days. But keep up the research because there are so many smarter than I.Good luck and remember, every time that you want to scream in frustration....This is FUN!Fast chip and recommended.2. I've tried 1600 MHz Crucial Sport Ballistics RAM (it was in the other machine) and could only get to 4.6 GHz, but I was just curious and didn't spend much time on it. This Kingston RAM is doing well, allowing very aggressive timings at 2400 MHz or a substantial overclock, maybe I'm old school, but I'm tuning the timings. I tried a second cooler fan and have lowered the temps, so I went for 4.8 and reached it, booting and running benchmarks. This took 1.34v on the core and a substantial cache v offset however, which rocketed temps up too high and it appears the CPU is throttling back, thus achieving little to no overall gain using the ITU benchmarking.Backing down to 1.3v and 4.8 on 1 core and 4.2 on the cache brought the temp back down to 84 degrees but that amounts to little gain also, so I didn't bother testing for stability.Sadly, for me it appears that about 4.7 on air is my max. If...or is it when? I switch to water, I'll let you know my progress. I see that the Corsair H100i works in this little case and that'll do the job.3. I think I've squeezed this as best as I can while still on air, I had to think a little outside the box so I thought you might want to know. Maybe I can save you a case of energy drinks.To sum it up, I used the CPU input voltage and limits, core and cache multipliers plus their voltages, plus the reference clock in different combinations all weighed against temps and then I tightened the memory timings. Sounds easy writing it, so why the bleep did it take me another 20 hours?To reach 4.755 GHz stable the multiplier is at 47 on all 4 cores. The base clock is at 101.17 and 4047 GHz, this brought the RAM up to 2428 MHz and forced me to use less aggressive timings. The cache multiplier is at 44x. The core is at 1.33v and max temp is 89 degrees and I'm not seeing any throttling.This is providing the best benchmarks and the computer is booting and acting normal in every way. Now I better reload Win 7 after all those crashes, that of course should go quickly. I'm still considering water but I hope recording my journey helps some of you.","rating":5},{"comment":"I recently purchased this CPU because I was having some video issues on my AMD FX-8350 build. I would get this micro stutter when panning left or right in any of the latest release games or games that require a mid to high range video card to run (Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, Far Cry 3, Metro 2033 etc.) I know my video could handle it as I have a EVGA GTX 780 Ti Super Clocked and I know that beast eats all the latest graphics like they aren't even there so I was a bit concerned why I was getting this stutter. I changed out so many parts it was ridiculous. I finally had enough and changed to this CPU (I used the EVGA Z97 FTW board) and right away that stutter just left as soon as it arrived. Now I'm not saying that AMD is bad by any means, look what's in the next gen consoles, but I sure was tired of fighting with the issue I had and Intel delivered the performance I was hoping for. This was my first Intel build and I have to say I'm a huge fan now. I know its a bit more expensive but it certainly was worth the extra money for it.

I was originally going to stick with my 4770k but Gigabyte released an update to support the 4790k on my GA-Z87-D3HP motherboard and the price was right so I made the upgrade. The higher base clock speed seems to speed up rendering time on projects by 10% to 15% depending on the effects in the timeline. Not extremally amazing, but a somewhat reasonable excuse to use my old 4770k as an upgrade for my gaming rig at home.Currently running it with a CORSAIR Hydro Series H60 and with no overclocking it seems to be running about 6 degrees C cooler than the 4770k at base clock. I did try a little bit of overclocking and pushed core voltage up to a bit over 1.25v and was able to get the clock up to 4.6 GHZ, but that's as brave as I was willing to be with a brand new processor.I'm glad Gigabyte is releasing updates for their Z87 boards, but I don't think the 4790k is a &#34;must have&#34; if you are already running a 4770k. Still a nudge up in clock speed and a drop in operating temp is always a good thing. If you are finally making the upgrade from an old i7-920 or a 2770k, spend a little extra and get the 4790k. If you already have a 4770k in your system, it's only a minor upgrade.

I previously had a 4770k, and it was a terrible overclocker. No matter what I did I couldn't achieve a speed over 4.2ghz. Not the fault of Intel, that's just the way it is with computer components. I was going to wait until Maxwell, at the very earliest, to upgrade again, then Intel released this CPU for pretty much the same cost as the 4770k.

Dunno why Intel bothers releasing with only 5%, I guess there's still plenty of suckers and a few more with 10yo pc's.

It has sensitivity level of 1000 dpi which is perfectly good for average daily use but it may be a little lacking if you use it for serious gaming. 1000 dpi seems low compared to some of the higher sensitivity gaming mouses that I have used but it honestly still feels very responsive so I am not sure that it really matters much.I am using this mouse on my Dell laptop that is running Windows 8.1 and I have had no compatibility issues. I plugged it in and it was working within about 15 seconds. There are no CD's to run or software to install. It's truly plug and play.This mouse looks incredibly cool to say the least. It's oval shaped and almost like half of a big egg. Except it has a mirror finish on it that makes it look very futuristic. It sits nice in your hand and feels very natural. It doesn't have any other buttons on the top except for the left and right button and the scroll wheel on top. This mouse has LED lights inside that light up and illuminate the entire mouse. There are sections of the mouse that lights up bright and then there are sections where the light shines through the mirror finish. By default it will alternate colors but you can lock it on a certain color if you want. There is a button on the bottom that you flip and it will stay on it's current color. The same button will turn it off if you don't want to use the lights.This mouse doesn't have a lot of options but the LED lights and it's physical appearance is awesome. I can almost guarantee that anyone that walks in your house and sees this mouse will comment on how cool it is. It changes colors between various shades of blue, red, green and purple.I went back and forth when trying to decide whether or not this mouse deserves 4 or 5 stars. Again the sensitivity and options are a little lacking but this mouse is really fun to use and watch and I really enjoy using it. I have used a couple other illuminated mouses and they have also looked cool but this one looks even better. I decided that I like it enough to give it 5 stars.Sample provided for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"Besides having a fancy chrome finish, this mouse actually works great.Once in the hand, it fits very comfortably.

It&#8217;s a neat and flashy way of attracting attention and adding some color and vibrancy to your work environment. It would probably be the favorite option with the younger crowd, especially kids and teens.

The mouse is simply plug and play, no drivers CD to mess with and windows installed what it needed in just seconds automatically.The Satechi mouse is designed quite comfortably and feels just like a hand shake, quite ergonomical.  A fun twist for this mouse is the lighting and that the unit can show up to 7 different colors.  You can adjust the mouse to continually cycle through the 7 total colors, only select one color, or turn off the light all by adjusting the switch on the bottom.The mouse has a 1000 dpi sensitivity which is more than acceptable for general computing needs.

It is ergonomically designed & can be used right or left handed. The side grips provide a comfortable grip for your thumb & little finger. Mouse settings (button configuration, double click speed, click lock, etc) can be changed if necessary. I find this mouse to be precise & haven't had any problems with the pointer. The wheel functions as a third button & it can be used to scroll too. This is a wired mouse which I prefer (4.9' cable). I do not like having a battery go dead on me & not having a replacement handy. Besides, in my opinion, a wired mouse is more Eco friendly.I almost forgot to mention that this mouse is fingerprint-resistant.  I don't know how that is accomplished, but it is true. I haven't seen a fingerprint on it  yet. Today I had lotion on my hands, but had to use the mouse. The lotion left some marks, but all in all, the chrome\/silver finish really didn't look too bad...and I'm picky about smudges & prints on shiny surfaces.

It's lighted, practically glows in the dark, and changes colors continuously.  If that's not what you want, no worries.

The ability to have the unit prioritize the 5ghz AC onto one of the radios while leaving the other 5ghz for slower equipment is awesome.The only two complaints I have are: the antennas are somewhat flimsy in construction so be careful moving them, and the firmware doesn't give you the option like on the 7000 to prioritize downstream QoS.Other than that, a great bit of kit","rating":5},{"comment":"Yes !!!!!!! USD 300 seems to be a very big amount for router when you can get most of them at about 40-60 bucks and your friends will swear they work really good and they get very good internet speed with their cheaper routers. They will drag you to buy the cheaper one and get stuck with the Internet speed.BUT DO NOT FALL IN TO THIS TRAP !!!! Get the best router in the market !!!I went against all my friend's suggestions and decoded to get the Nighthawk X6 from Netgear a few weeks back. I would say this is the best router till date. It has so many revolutionary features, which will change the definition of router forever, not to mention the internet speed it provides with its two frequencies and three channels in total. I can assure all you future customers that you wont regret spending your hard earned money on this router.  This router is worth every penny of its price.I liked it so much that I have stopped using my Apple Airport time machine (which I had bought a few months back to use as a router and a backup hard drive for my MacBook pro). It now works as a backup device only. The router has two USB ports and now I can connect another hard drive to it to keep have my collection of movies always available to me, not on my computer's hard drive but readily available when ever I need them.A few of the features of the router, which I love:1. A tri-band WiFi, two of them working at 5GHz give you the fastest internet service, ideal for gaming and online streaming2. S3. One of my favorite feature is the programmable guest network (which can be with or without password) and the best thing is you can program it for a specific duration after which it will be disabled automatically).4. You can access your home network from your office location using a VPN facility-the ultimate requirement in today's era !!5. WiFi signal has implicit and explicit beam forming of signal so that the device being used gets the maximum of the bandwidth of Wi-Fi, thus improving speed further6. Two USB pots, one of them USB3.0 make the data access superfast from the connected devices.7. Included software application \"Genie\" is actually a genie in all senses. You can control your internet using this, update the software, change passwords, activate\/inactivate guest access, apply parental controls, and many more (you can even see what deceives are connected to your WiFi ;)8. 8 Sixe external antennas, which were introduced in previous model and increased in number in this one, increase the signal strength manifold in almost all parts of your home.9. ReadySHARE Vault helps you backup your Windows machine without even you noticing it.A few minor things I didn't like but I am sure they wont hold anyone from buying this gem of a device:1. It occupies a relatively larger space on ground (can't be kept upright) but you can circumvent this by hanging it on a wall)2. The switches on the front are a little difficult to push3. Antennas seems a little fragile (but they wont break until you are in a mood to literally wrestle with the device or you are angry because your favorite team lost the match and you can't blame anyone else !!!).With all said and written, I would say Nighthawk X6 is a next-generation router stuffed with a plethora of unbelievably pleasant features which will amuse gamers and others alike !!! Do not let the price be a hindrance in you getting the best internet speed around your house!!!Go for it !!!EDIT\/DISCLAIMER (July 09, 2014):A few people have revised the question that how could I use it for weeks when it was released a day back. Well, I would like to make it clear that I was invited as a beta tester for this router even before it was released in market. I had already used it for a month. But in the hindsight, I would have bought it even if I had not used it earlier.I would suggest you that if you are serious about buying a quality high performance router, get it from Amazon, use for a few weeks and return it if you do not like (and I am sure it will never come to that !!!). Also, I declare that I am not affiliated to Netgear nor did I get any compensation\/favors from Netgear for this review.","rating":5},{"comment":"I want to like it but I don't. Coming from RT-AC66U, besides a mere range improvement, everything else is a downgrade if my RT-AC66U wasn't dying on me.Pros:Range on 5Ghz improved over RT-AC66U in my house. YMMV.Speed is OKCons:1) Warning to Chromecast users, this router DOES NOT support Chromecast. The router simply refused to connect Chromecast. I thought it was Chromecast but as soon as I connect it to different wireless AP such as DIR-865L and RT-AC66U, it worked. I see there're other users had reported the same issue. In this case, I blame Netgear.2) VPN is poorly implemented. No Android or iOS is a failure.3) Limited guest networks. RT-AC66U allows you to setup 3 Guest networks on each band, up to 6 total combined. R8000 allows 1 guest networks on each band, 3 total.4) QoS, no options to decide which device gets higher priority. There's basically nothing can configure under QoS page.5) No traffic monitor. I cannot see download\/upload speed as I did on RT-AC66U. I just could not find it anywhere.4) Cannot disable WPS completely, although this does not concerns as far as WPS PIN can be turned off.Reliability Update:It's not reliable at all I must say. After updated to latest version firmware - V1.0.0.90_1.0.39. After a day or two, my WAN speed is dragged down to a few meg and latency goes up as high as 250 ms after I ran a few test on speedtest.net. I rebooted the router, the speed restored, 102Mbps\/5.12Mbps, 10 ms latency.","rating":1},{"comment":"Let me get the disclaimer out of the way in saying that this review is based on a beta version that I received through a beta program. With that said do keep in mind that some things may differ from the final retail product but for the most part part things should generally be the same.Ill do my best to keep this review straight to the point. Also keep in mind that my previous highest router was a Netgear WNDR3700 running third party firmware Gargoyle. To make a comparison to this router isn't really fair but its also my only point of reference.DesignYou either love it or you hate it. In my opinion the design looks industrial, futuristic and maybe even over the top with the antennas extended out; it makes me think of a Robotic Spider. The design may not have the universal appeal of the previous R7000 but I like it.Design Pros:-Open vents on top for great airflow and heat dissipation but with this increases the possibility of dust being collected over time  (Keep that router clean) but overall this is worth the trade off.-Ability to switch LEDs ON or OFF-Unit comes in a matte black finish (I like that this finish reduces the look of finger prints, dust, and scratches)-Having all ports on the rear is a plus as it makes wall mounting setup\/cable management easier to deal withDesign Cons:-Router has a large foot print-The antennas when extended do feel delicate and the design is such that the antennas on this unit aren't user replaceable. Same if the unit is wall mounted and you have the antennas projected outward. (Be careful!) This isn't an issue if the unit is set in area out of the way.-When wall mounting the text on the router is upside down but this is a minor quip-Little to no tactile response when pressing the buttons on top of the routerUsability\/PerformanceStraight up - This router performs!!! I've had 10 plus devices connected to this thing at one time at least half of those devices were streaming and or downloading content and this router didn't skip a beat! Top notch performance! Now I have to say for the techies doing heavy torrenting and\/or usenet depending on the setup of those apps you could still negatively affect or impact your network if you choose to max out connections using said apps however again for normal everyday situations this router screams! Also the router has a good feature set. (I love features and functionality which is why install 3rd party firmware on all of my routers) The stock firmware covers the basics well in this respect. Printer\/USB drive sharing is an easy affair to setup. OpenVPN support is included as well. This is a minor gripe but I wish there was better or more advanced QOS options available like throttling a single IP or mac address and creating QOS tiers and such.Pros-High throughput and fast speeds throughout whether downloading\/streaming from the internet or streaming a local network share\/usb drive from your network-Wifi load balancing across the 5GHz radios works well and is seamless-Strong 5GHz range (when comparing my older WNDR3700)-Fast wireless transfer speeds to USB drive connected on USB3 port (I averaged 80-90mbps with an attached 3TB Toshiba External using the 5GHz band)-USB Storage sharing works great in conjuction with DDNS. Easy setup to access\/share files from anywhere on the net.Cons-Slow router setup\/interface. When making changes\/applying settings the router will (for the most part) usually require a reboot. When applying settings this can take about 15sec to apply and most times internet\/wireless connectivity is interrupted in the process.-Lacking advanced QOS featuresI heavily use 3rd party firmware such as DD-WRT or OpenWRT and one strong feature of it,(at least for the most part) is that a user can configure many aspects of router settings, then save settings in one section and move on and configure the next section and so on. Then when the user is ready to commit the changes, they can select to apply the changes and have the settings be applied and router reset if necessary in one go round.Doing this would greatly speed up the router setup and reduce the many router\/connection resets that currently occurs in the setup of the current firmware.Overall ImpressionsAs mentioned before this is a beast of a router! This router is hella fast and the wireless experience, no question is greatly improved from my old router. I have since re-purposed my old WNDR3700 routers as wireless bridges to the R8000 and everything is working great!","rating":4},{"comment":"I should not have assumed my experience would be better than some of the other reviewers but I generally have good luck so I went for it.  Big mistake.  It took a long time to install because it kept finding other routers already on my network that weren't there but I decided to wait it out and it did get installed.  The major problem was the fact that it kept dropping the internet connection.  It would reconnect but with all the different devices I have on my network the interruptions were REALLY annoying.  A second disappointment was the fact that the highly touted range was no better than my old Netgear R6300 router which I'm going back to.","rating":1},{"comment":"Very disappointed with the Nighthawk X6 so far. Wireless range through walls isn't boosted noticeably compared to the prior Netgear router I was using, the Netgear N600. Administration interface is consistent with the N600. The X6 definitely looks cool, but aside from looks, I'm not seeing much here to say that it's worth $300.Even worse, while attempting to download files via Sabnzbd (a file download manager), if I allow the application to download without limitation, it typically maxes out my internet connection (50mbps or ~5-6MB\/s). On my N600, this behavior was handled just fine. On the X6, though, the router will consistently stop functioning completely after a matter of minutes of full connection usage. What's ridiculous about this, is that it's not like I have an amazing internet connection that the router can't handle. This router is supposed to be able to handle gigabit connections, yet it can't even handle 50 megabit...  Once the router fails to function, I can't even access the router control panel, as the network is completely non-functional. The only resolution is to restart the router. This has occurred every time that I've sustained max bandwidth on my internet connection for (at least) several minutes.I'm returning the existing unit to Amazon for a replacement, and I'll give it one more shot. If the replacement has the same behavior, I'll be getting a refund.And just a note, I did contact Netgear support about this issue. Live Chat was useless, as it kept me \"on hold\" waiting for a CSR for ~30 minutes, then told me no one was available. I then called in, got a call center in India apparently (or at least that region). The CSR had poor english, I had to explain the situation multiple times. He had me reset the router settings (which I did), and afterwards, the problem persisted (as expected). His recommendation was an RMA or return to store, for which obviously returning to Amazon is the better option, since Amazon should send me a replacement before I have to send back the original unit.UPDATE (7\/22):I've received a replacement for the Nighthawk X6, from Amazon. I installed the replacement, restored my prior unit's settings to the new unit.I then rebooted my computers (to start fresh), and then started up Sabnzbd on my tower PC.That PC is running wired ethernet to the router. Any other computer on the network is using wifi.With Sabnzbd running, I started up multiple file downloads, each with multiple connections per file, and configured Sabnzbd to download without any limitations (meaning, it was able to use the full capacity of my ISP connection). My internet connection is a home connection that maxes out around 55mbps (around 5-6MB\/s). Once Sabnzbd surpassed 4.5MB\/s, any other open connections on the network shut down\/disconnected (video conference stream, voip audio connection).Additionally, any pages that I attempted to visit or view, any domains I attempted to ping, etc, all failed.I attempted to view various web services that I have enabled on other local network computers, none were accessible. I also attempted to view the router administration page, again it was not accessible.This is entire unacceptable. While my internet connection may be at full capacity, which would understandably cause too much congestion for other data feeds to run consistently over my WAN connection, the fact that the entire network is brought to a standstill (non-functional) suggests something is completely wrong with the router.This has occurred across two pieces of hardware, which suggests to me that the software is where the issue lies (or else there is a solid flaw in the hardware).My usage of the router is exactly how I used the previous router that I had installed, the Netgear N600, which worked flawlessly in this regard (I replaced that router as it's performance started to degrade recently, after ~2 yrs of ownership).I've contacted Netgear as they've requested, with the above updated info. Ball is in their court now.UPDATE (7\/23): Netgear support was pretty much non-existent. Sure, it's easy to get a level-1 CSR that spouts the same generic troubleshooting steps, but good luck getting anyone that understands what they're actually trying to troubleshoot.In my own testing, running Sabnzbd with ~60 open connections at ~3MB\/s is stable-ish on the R8000, but once the download speed is increased to ~3.5-5MB\/s, the network becomes unusable to other machines. There are no log events that would suggest a firewall rule is being triggered (such as NAT filtering, DOS, etc). It seems the router is simply unable to cope with this type of traffic.I'm sending the router back to Amazon for a refund, and will revert to using my old Netgear N600 until I get an alternative router, likely the high-end option from ASUS, as I've heard good things about that brand of router.","rating":1},{"comment":"I have a pretty diverse network -- a couple of MacBook Pros, a Lenovo W520, an HP 8550, a couple of home-built systems, iOS tablets, Android tablets, an old Roku, a new Roku, printers, cell phones, VoIP phones, NAS, and Blu-Ray players. Some are wired. Some are wireless. I'm sure I'm missing other things there.Having been a network engineer well before the 802.11b spec was anything anyone cared about, I was really excited to see Netgear was building a multi-core router that could handle my devices *and* be smart enough to create a &#34;slow lane&#34;. I had been giving some lower-end Cisco gear some consideration, but for my consoles, UPnP was a deal breaker. (Can I add static routes and ACLs for each console and program that expects UPnP to be there? Sure. Do I want to? No.)Out of the box, I was underwhelmed. I don't know what kind of gear people are using that makes the build quality seem &#34;premium&#34; here, but Netgear's own switches are built way better than this router and at a tenth (yes, 1\/10) of the price. I flipped out each antenna, plugged it in, and got to configuring...The initial configuration from my Windows 8 system wanted to poop router and NAS applications on my system. I took a look at the router app, and ended up firing up a browser. The admin page that came up was indistinguishable fromNetgear's N900 router, which I thought was a major disappointment. This is squarely marketed as an enthusiast's router, so I was expecting at least as much functionality as you'd get out of DD-WRT on a throwaway router. Not so with the R8000. The router quickly called home and asked for a firmware update (V1.0.0.74_1.0.31)Once I had it configured, I started moving wireless clients over. About halfway through, I noticed that a couple of devices saw two 5GHz SSID's instead of one. Later testing would show that the router wasn't forcing slow devices to flop over to their own network. If the device could see two SSIDs with the same name, they'd associate with whatever you chose on the device, instead of the router being &#34;smart&#34; and choosing what network to allow association with.Strike one.Later in the evening, I noticed my Macbook Pro stopped passing WAN traffic, but didn't have any trouble hitting LAN traffic. Rebooting the router resolved the problem. And rebooting the router resolved the problem again after four hours. And again...Strike two.My ultra-fast router *should* be pretty impressive when it comes to LAN traffic, right? I mean, my months-old MacBook Pro *should* be able to connect to the network with the fastest throughput, and it *should* be pretty fast to my NAS device, connected to the router via GigE. Well, not so much. The throughput I'm seeing is in the neighborhood of 70 megabits. Even at 30% overhead, I should be seeing almost ten times the throughput I'm getting.Strike three.I noticed that Netgear has recently released V1.0.0.90_1.0.39 firmware, which seems to have addressed the &#34;the WAN just stops working&#34; problem, but has made LAN throughput even worse.Sorry, Netgear. That just won't do. For what this costs, I can buy three routers and run three separate wireless networks for less money, with improved throughput, and improved range.","rating":2},{"comment":"Well, more like a 4.5.  I wanted a router with a bit longer 5ghz range as I had a D6200 in back of my AT&T; uverse, and the 5ghz signal was iffy in my room like 35ft away from the router.  This R8000 seem to be the latest with all the bells and whistles.  They touted long range with 6 antennas.  The -.5 is for the antennas.  For 299 retail you'd expect a little more quality.  You pull the antennas up and they feel like they're just gonna break off, very flexy flimsy feeling, but no problems once they're in place.  Not sure if they are helping or not yet, haven't had time to adjust them, they will stay put at 45 degrees and 90.  The router itself has like a whole line of leds on top which I don't know what they all are for, but it's bright.  You can thankfully turn them off in the setup.  The setup is identical to any other netgear router, so it was easy.  You can keep the 2 - 5ghz signals separate with 2 different ssid's, or combine them which I did using one ssid.  I didn't see much difference either way as the netgear seemed to divide up the online devices between the two, so I just let netgear do it instead of me having to put in a new ssid for half my devices.  So setup, I was up in less then 30 minutes, since I had a netgear already.  I updated the firmware and seems pretty stable.  Well for the 2 days I had it so far, it's been rock steady.  All my devices are at the same IP's so I know it hasn't rebooted as one of my devices is on an access point with dhcp built in and that always changes when the router reboots.  So far it's been pretty good.  All my devices have the 5 wireless bars and connections excellent throughout my smaller house.  I was only getting 2 bars in my bedroom with the D6200, so it's a little better then 2x the D6200.  I haven't tested my tablet outside, but that will be the next test.  I will post any negatives I find as I work with this, but so far it's a straight forward design and tried and true setup interface that's pretty easy to setup.  If you have an RG3800 and need info on how,  post a msg, i'll try to explain it.  Oh and I was connecting at low 200's Mbps with an AC1200 adapter,  but now it's always 650Mbps and above in my room,  any closer and it always connects at the AC1200 speed which is 867Mbps.  And the rest you can get from specs online, basically on\/off button, usb 2 and 3,  4 Ethernet gigabit ports, 1 wan.Update: So far had it about a week and it's been working great.  I have my security cams forwarded with upnp on with no problems now.  Everything is working as it should.  I was a linksys fan, but this is working great for me.  Oh and it does have guest access too, but i have mine all turned off, two SSID's is plenty enough.  will put a network hard drive on next, will report if i have any difficulties.","rating":5},{"comment":"I know how to set up a network.  Done it more times than I can count, for myself and family members.  I thought this new version of what is purported to be the best router available would possibly solve some of the range problems I have experienced in my house.No such luck.  I plugged it in, followed the installation instructions and let the genie update the firmware.  My brand new network was clearly visible on all of my devices, but nothing would connect to it.  I finally got the laptop connected, but the connection dropped mysteriously a few minutes later.  The router's power button was blinking, which according to the manual means a problem with the firmware.  So I backed off and manually re-installed the original firmware from their website.  The light was still blinking. I say all of this to make it clear that I am not a newbie.  I know what I am doing.I spent 30 minutes on hold at the Netgear tech support number, which suggests I am not the only one having trouble.  Sadly, after that 30 minute wait, the phone call was terminated with no warning, just BLIP and they hung up on me.  Kind of like the router's network connections.  So I never did get to talk to a customer service rep.This is going back to Amazon today.  I might try it again after Netgear cleans up some of the problems, but for now in my opinion it is not worth the trouble, or the price.","rating":1},{"comment":"Drops connections, definitely needs firmware update.. but hey shouldn't they have tested this thing COMPLETELY before being released??  Nope no one ever does.  This is the first Netgear router I have bought in years.  I still remember when I bought a Netgear maybe about 6-7 years ago.  It was fast, but always needed to be rebooted.  I gave up.  Then Apple came out with all their new products. Sorry guys, but Apple is successful because their products work,  are tested before being released and are easy to work with.  I was debating before buying this router, could it actually beat the time capsule ac router?  Well, when it works its fast.  When it works.  There are slow downs, dropped connections, I hate it how my ipad kept switching from the 5ghz to the 2.4 ghz signal.  Then it stopped working until I hate to turn the wifi off and on.  It probably took me 6 hours today to realize that back to my old time capsule.  At least it works fine.","rating":3},{"comment":"Out of the box:  Wao factor with six dedicated movable antennas that you can position inside the unit or outside to increase coverage. Gigabit ports and USB 2 and USB 3 ports. Great!  Now I can connect the printer and an external hard drive and share them with all of my devices.Installation: Seamless if you have used Netgear Gennie software before and easy even if you have not. The manual was concise enough not to intimidate and invite actual reading.First day: Wao you have 3 radios that you can customize with either the same network name and password or make 3 separate networks with different names and passwords. You can duplicate that with guest networks for each radio for a total of six possible network names and passwords. I used WPA2 AES WiFi security with a 16 character password. No problems there.First week: Speed: I have 20+ bandwidth hungry devices.  2 Rokus, 3 game consoles, 5 laptops, 4 iPads, 2 iphones, TVs, receivers, cable boxes with sling, etc. I tested the router having 4 devices stream HD movies at the same time. Impressive performance. It consumed most of my 25 Mbps Comcast cable modem bandwidth but all movies played without skipping or buffering in HD.  Not bad!  The router was a bit hot after that test so place it in a well vented high area with nothing on top of it with the antennas up.First month:  I love it.  I can now cut the lawn in my backyard while streaming iTunes radio!  I have coverage in all parts of my home and beyond without extenders that cut performance.

Needless to say this router is a huge and much needed improvement.  I noticed that on all of my computers, tablets, and smart phones that the internet pages load faster.  Apps that use a lot of bandwidth such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Flixster all load faster and adjust to HD quality streaming way faster than with my old router.  I also noticed that performance remains outstanding even when we are using three demanding apps at the same time (wife and I watching Netflix and Amazon Prime, and the kids watching Netflix on the TV.I have to admit that I was very hesitant to purchase this router after reading a lot of negative reviews of the router's performance, especially with the 5Ghz channels.  I am here to tell you now that with the latest firmware update, these problems are gone.  The first thing I did when I installed the router was update the firmware immediately.  From the first minute I started using the router I have had zero issues.  There have been no problems connecting to the router with my PC (Windows 8.1 Pro), any of my tablets (Apple iPad 4, Amazon Kindle HDX, Samsung Galaxy Tab S), or our smart phones (Samsung Galaxy S5 & Note 3).So without further ado, here are my lists of Pros and Cons:PROs1) Simultaneous Tri-band Wi-Fi works as advertised - no issues with network load when multiple users are online2) Excellent wireless range - the beam forming technology really works well and ensures the strongest signal by adjusting the frequency management accordingly with the surrounding environment3) Build quality of the router is second to none, though it is a bit larger than previous routers that I've owned4) The NETGEAR website is easy to navigate and both software manual and latest firmware are easy to find under the Support section5) The NETGEAR technical support team has surprised a lot of customers by aggressively addressing the early release technical issues this router had and have successfully fixed most if not all of the problems.CONs1) Price is high at $300, but there is currently no competition for this class of WiFi router...yet...Asus will be releasing their next-gen routers soon, so expect NETGEAR to drop the price on the X6 a bit to remain competitive with Asus!2) Does not support next-generation MU-MIMO technology.  There are rumors that NETGEAR may release a firmware update that will allow for MU-MIMO like capability, but don't hold your breath.  This router does not have the necessary hardware to officially support MU-MIMO technology (i.e. Qualcomm QCA 9980 and QCA 9982).Bottom line, if you want an excellent upgrade to your aging 802.11g or 802.11n router, now is the time to jump in and get this awesome router.  You will not be disappointed...unless that is if you have a thin wallet or really 'need' MU-MIMO  :-D","rating":5},{"comment":"Wow. after YEARS of fighting weak Wifi (really, YEARS).  Spending stupid amounts of money on repeaters and becoming a near expert on antenna tech, I had given up on my house.  I had two bids in hand for a couple thousand bucks to hard wire in enough Cat 6 points to ensure high bandwidth to SEVERAL access points to supply signal to the different levels and locations I need Internet.  (The House ain't that grand, just several levels and I work at home and move around a lot.  It also has some mystery materials that seem resistant to signal.)Today FedEx brought me salvation.  The easiest, most bullet-proof set-up that I've ever used.  30 minutes start to finish to change out an old installation and be writing this review on hi band AC.  Here's the best part.  I am sittiing RIGHT NOW at the furtherest point in my house from the router with LESS THAN 5% (waaay less) fall off from HARDWIRED speed UP AND DOWN and I am using a lap top with no augmentation.  (That means that I don't have a little USB dongle on my laptop to boast single.)  Specifically, my download speed is over 55 and my upload is over 12 (Mbps).  Now your area may have greater or less speed than mine but my AT THE PLUG speed on ethernet is less than 5% higher tested in realtime.So, to tell you the truth.  I have always hated Netgear.  When a client put in one of their low end routers months ago, I groaned.  Now, I'm here to say the R8000 (AKA AC3200) - JUST SCREAMS.  And it is equally MAC friendly, has a nice iphone app and serves as an iTunes server.I think it will be a while before anything beats this.  Wow.

This WiFi adapter has such a huge antenna on it that I think you could receive Wii in deep space. The total length of the antenna is about 18 inches long and is about a quarter inch wide at the tip and about an inch and a half wide at the bottom.First of all I want to clarify exactly how you use this adapter for those that may be unsure. I originally thought that this was like the typical WiFi range extender that you hook up and it boost your entire WiFi network. This adapter is connected to your computer and boosts the reception for that computer. It serves a very different purpose than I originally thought it would but it's still very useful, just in a different way. A Wii extender boosts your entire WiFi signal a little bit. This adapter boosts the range on one device very significantly.I have been using this adapter on my gaming laptop that is running Windows 8.1. Installation was a breeze and only took about a minute. It comes with a mini disk and you need to run setup and install the drivers. Once that is done you can plug it in and get started. From my living room my laptop usually has 5 bars and can pick up not only our connection but about ten of our neighbors WiFi signals. When I plug this adapter into my laptop it still has five bars but it can also pick up about 40 different connections around our house. When I take my laptop upstairs my signal is reduced drastically from 5 bars to 1 or 2 bars. My internet speed is greatly reduced upstairs as well. When I plug this adapter into my laptop upstairs it brings my bars back to 5 and my internet speed back to around what it is downstairs.Based on my experience it seems like this adapter will give you 3 or 4 times your normal range. That is very impressive and can come in really handy at times. There are times when we travel and utilize WiFi signals at hotels, airports and various different internet hot spots. These type of connections are notoriously slow and weak. This adapter is a awesome little tool for times like these. It includes a mounting bracket and cable ties if you wish to mount it but I just carry it around. It fits in the front pocket of my laptop bag and can be carried around. The price of this adapter is very reasonable for the quality of the hardware and it's strong performance. I would highly recommend this adapter, especially for the frequent traveler that carries a laptop.Sample provided for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"TheBlurex Wireless-N USB Adapterhas made it much easier to get a wireless signal to my computer in the basement.

Prior to using this adapter, I was lucky to get 1 bar of signal and that would constantly drop.  Now I have 5 full bars since this antenna is on the same level as my router, really fantastic.Setup was really easy and since this adapter runs on wireless N, it performs much better than the b\/g adapter that my computer came standard with.

I found this product to be a good solution both indoors and outdoors. Of note, Blurex appears to be an up and coming manufacturer\/distributor and I have been fairly impressed with most of their products so far (though its website leaves a lot to be desired and no online support is provided at this time).The product arrived packaged very well.  The build quality of the antenna is substantial.  The USB cable does not promote signal loss over its length.  Setup is generally easy and I experienced no issues. In my environment, I ran it from a Windows 7 computer (about 3 years old) to the outer edge of our back porch.  Windows 7 automtaically installed the drivers.  This placement extended the range throughout our entire backyard with very solid signal strength that was consistent. The mounting hardware was more than sufficient for my needs, though in some situations you may want\/need to make minor adjustments.It is important to note that unlike traditional range extenders, this product, via USB, plugs directly into a computer and extends the wireless range of that device and any devices supported by that device. I can see this being a very useful product for over the road truck drivers who may access wi-fi at truck stops on the road and they need to lock in a more solid connection.  It will also be of significant benefit to those putting on events at hotels or convention centers in which you want to establish a solid connection.

To pull in a weak signal, this adapter really works! 4.5 stars (rounded to 5).BACKGROUND:  To test this adapter, we used a new model Acer laptop in our home's n-network.  Our wifi signal varies depending where you are in our home (or if you're outside our home; we have thick, hurricane impact windows and doors).  When the Acer laptop was receiving a 1-, 2- or 3-bar signal, switching to this Wifi adapter bumped up the signal strength 2 bars!  I don't know the actual dB measure of what a 5-bar meter is on a laptop, but I do know that more bars = stronger signal.  Using this wifi adapter seriously surprised me at what a difference it made.WHAT WE LIKED:- It works!  It noticeably improved the signal reception of our home's wifi signal.  It actually impressed my college son who helped test this antenna for me.- It was a cinch to install under Windows 8.  It was plug-n-play all the way, with no drivers to install.- Windows 8 lets us pick which adapter to use to select to the available networks.WHAT WE WISHED IT HAD:- Our network is dual-band, so we have a 5Ghz band that we typically use.  This antenna only works with the 2.4Ghz.  2.4Ghz has more interference than 5Ghz, which is why we opt for the 5Ghz band.  Also, the 5Ghz band would benefit from an adapter like this, because its range degrades quickly the further you move away from the router.CONCLUSION:  Excellent product if you can deal with the large antenna size and 2.4Ghz band of your n-network!

It also came with a lanyard that connects to one corner, thereby you can hold it by the rope or hang it on your bag.Quick specs:- 1,000 mAH lithium battery- Charging time is about 3-4 hours- 100Hz-20Khz frequency response- 4 ohm, 3W speaker- Bluetooth V2.1+EDRA sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is a very cute speaker. Just as shown, packaging is first class. The things is very rugged, I splashed water and worked great. Excellent in outdoors, and bathrooms, No need to worry if water splashes during shaving etc. Sound quality is excellent. Sample received in exchange of a fair and honest review.","rating":5},{"comment":"It is pretty good for what it is, a small, single-speaker Bluetooth speaker.  It can get quite loud, but the sound quality is not great.  Obviously the louder you get the more harsh it sounds, though not necessarily distorted.  Being only 1 speaker you don't get the stereo effect of a Jambox or one of its asssociated copycats.  I find generally sound on those is superior, as well as the volume.  But of course they are more bulky.The utterly ridiculous voice that screams \"Waiting for Bluetoos co-nection\" (not a typo) is so annoying.  It is loud, it is obviously spoken (poorly) by a non-English speaker.  It seems this is common on these cheaper made in China speakers.  I truly fail to see how this is better than just a beep, an LED, or nothing at all.  It is just annoying.  I would probably give it an extra star if I could turn that off.-----------------------------------------------UPDATE - 7\/9\/14:The manufacturer reached out and said they were fixing my complaint about the voice prompt and would send me a replacement unit. True to my original review, I said that would add a star, and therefore I have revised my rating to 4 stars to do so. I also consider that excellent customer service from the manufacturer, so that would factor positively into my decision to buy this product.","rating":4},{"comment":"The instructions that came with this item were obviously not written by someone who speaks English. In fact, we had a good laugh reading them out loud! They were almost no help.Despite that, the speaker paired easily with my iPhone. Can't comment on the &#34;splash proof&#34; feature, as I'm not taking any chances with that aspect.  The sound is ok.","rating":4},{"comment":"The Omaker M3 is a nice, well designed portable Bluetooth (and can be wired) speaker. It also allows for NFC connection if your phone has this capability.The audio quality is not bad for a portable speaker that is light on price like this one, and one that offers splash proof-ness on top of this. If you are an audiophile, you will once again want to skip this speaker. Frequency response is 100 Hz to 20 KHz. This means you potentially lose a lot of the low end. In practice, the lows from this are good enough, but not deep, thumping if that's your thing. It's acceptable for the portability and being splash proof.Pairing the M3 to my phone was bang on simple, and the added voice prompts let you know exactly what the speaker is doing while pairing or waiting to pair. That is a nice addition.I listened to a variety of music on the speaker, and find more vocal heavy recordings sound pretty close to fantastic. Rock sounds good and rap, well, you miss a lot of the thump with the speaker so I'm not sure you would want the M3 for rap.The speaker includes volume up\/down functions and can act as a speaker phone if you so desire. Calls quality is good - better than using the phone itself for sound quality and volume.The manual is serviceable, but as with a lot of these less than expensive Chinese made goods, sold by Chinese companies, there are some issues with the language used. It's not as bad as say, Google Translate from Chinese to English, but it isn't what I would call English from a native speaker. It all makes sense (well, mostly), but it's just not English as we are accustomed. Thankfully you don't really need the manual if you know how to pair BT devices.Recommended.","rating":5},{"comment":"This speaker works really well.  I was pleasantly suprised at how well the NFC function worked in getting the speaker paired and going in no time.  The sound quality is great on par with other quality competitors.  I haven't gotten this thing wet, but I'm sure it will take a good splash as everything looks to seal properly. I would buy another one if the amazing deal I got for it comes around again.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Omaker M3 is a compact square shaped Bluetooth enabled external speaker, that delivers decent sound quality, for a unit with just a single speaker.  It's most notable feature might be that it is water resistant, and because of its square shape and flat sides, is very stable, and not easily tipped over.Like most external speakers, this device can be connected via Bluetooth, or hard wired using a standard 1\/8\" audio cord.  A micro-USB port for recharging, and a line in jack, reside behind a removable rubber strip.  Powered by rechargeable batteries, the rated life of the speakers is eight hours.Controls are elementary, consisting of four buttons.  Besides the power button, a second button raises the volume, while a third lowers it.  When linked to your phone, a fourth button allows you to take a call.  Covered by rubber panels, the buttons are a little difficult to operate, and you sometimes have to press them very hard.  The symbols on them are a bit hard to make out, so I used a marker pen to fill in the depressions on the symbols.Lightweight and easy to direct sound where you want it, this speaker produces a decent level of sound without distorting too much, but it just isn't capable of providing sound for a large space.  If you're looking for a speaker that delivers high volumes, this is not it.When turned on, the speaker quickly connects with any Bluetooth device that it has been previously paired with.  The unit has a number of prerecorded audible notifications, spoken by a female voice with a slight Asian accent.  They include \"Waiting for a Bluetooth connection\", and \"Bluetooth successfully connected\".  This quirky feature is something that other external speakers manufactured in Asia have.The people at Omaker provided a sample for evaluation.  Being weather resistant, having a low profile, and being compact and easy to carry, are probably this speaker's strongest attributes.  Acessories include an audio patch cord, micro-USB cord, and a detachable lanyard.","rating":4},{"comment":"For the $20 I paid, no concerns.  Was looking for a cheapie I could throw in my golf bag so I can stream tunes while on the course.  Rugged, good size (small) but the sound is completely acceptable.

Anyways, if they come back for $20 again, jump on it.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Sabrent CR-CCU3 Card reader is a great little USB 3.0 Card reader (backwards compatible with USB 2.0).

The USB cord is built into the unit so you don't have to carry around an extra cord, it folds over into a storage slot in the bottom and is about 2 inches long.  On the top of the unit is a semi transparent door that flips up to reveal a storage area for 1 CF card, 1 SD card, and 1 micro SD Card, all the cards fit into it snugly so when you turn it over the cards don't fall out.This would be a great accessory for a camera bag or laptop bag for photographers.

The first time that I plugged it in the drivers had to load but that only took about 30 seconds and it has worked well since then.It's basically a tiny box that is about 3 inches wide by 2 inches long by 3\/4 of an inch tall.

It transferred data smoothly and was easily recognized by my Windows computer. There does seem to be an issue with the unit's bonding, so where the top and bottom of the unit come together it is loose on one side. I would also be cautious with the cover for the storage area - bend it too far back and it would break.

The cable easily stores into the unit making it easier to store.The top of the unit has a flip door and underneath there is room for one each SD, Micro-SD and CF cards.  In terms of data transfer, I understand I am always limited to the data transfer capabilities built-in to the card i'm using, however at USB 3.0 Speeds, this card reader is built to work with the latest and greatest cards currently on the market.Overall, I really like this card reader.[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]","rating":5},{"comment":"The Sabrent 3-slot flash memory card reader is surprisingly compact at about 3 in. x 2 in. x 1\/2 in., so it can function an all-in-one card reader solution for use at home or when travelling.

It is USB-powered, plug & play, and no drivers are needed, so it is simple and completely non-aggravating to use.  There is an LED indicator for power and activity.It ships in a plastic clamshell which does provide excellent protection, but frustration-free packaging would be an improvement.  Otherwise, I have no complaints about this fast and reliable flash card reader.A sample was provided for evaluation and review.","rating":5},{"comment":"I'll refrain from reciting the specs and also disclose that I was unable to measure the actual transfer speeds of my review sample using USB 3.0. The reason for that is I did test it using a 8GB thumb drive and an OTG connector to my Galaxy Note 3 phone, but 8GB was not a sufficiently large transfer to accurately time.What I did do is plug it into my old ThinkPad T61 running Windows XP and mounted some of my old memory cards. I could read all of them and that is one of the reasons why I rated this reader so highly. Another reason is the size. It easily fits in a shirt pocket and has a short, flat pigtail with USB that fold under and snaps into the casing.Another thing I love is all of the slots are precision fit. Bit the final thing that won me over and inspired me to give it five stars is the top lid opens with cutouts for CF, SD\/MMC and micro SD card storage.Although the product specs only mention that this is backward compatible with USB 2.0, it is also compatible with 1.1 compliant devices. That means that it will work on most legacy devices with the most common legacy cards.If you have a large collection of older card media from cameras, phones and other devices this is an inexpensive way to transfer the files to a computer for further back-up.","rating":5},{"comment":"There are smaller card readers out there, but they also only read one or two types of cards.  This one reads all the standard card types, including the large CF type that are used in DSLRs.  So far, I haven't had any issues or needed to load special drivers.  I like the use of the small cord, which allows it to plug in without covering up nearby ports.  It even includes a card holder!  Overall, a good companion if you carry cameras or gadgets that use multiple card types.Thank you to Sabrent for the review unit.","rating":5},{"comment":"Everything is integrated here.  Cable included and has its own storage for extra  memory cards.  This works via USB 3.0 (of course backward compatible with earlier USB standards).  It can read 3 types of cards, TF (or microSD), SD and compact flash.  The semi-transparent lid lifts open to expose the storage.  One each for each type of mem card.  It closes with a snap so it won't open unless you lift it up with your nail.Not the fastest reader out there but not the slowest neither.  A great compact portable reader as you don't have to bring an extra cable with you.Cons:One minor con, the card storage doesn't hug\/hold the cards (they are just laying freely on its respective spaces) so they are loose and may fall off if the lid  accidentally opens.","rating":5},{"comment":"A fast little card-reader with a storage compartment and a captive cable.Good fit for my SDHC cards. I like how the card sticks out (no spring-loading). I have some media-card hubs (like in my Dell monitors) where the card has to be inserted deeply into the slot, and if the spring loaded eject mechanism doesn't work, you need pliers to pull the card out-- not fun.I really like the short captive cable and ability to store one card of each kind inside the lid (a nice place to keep spares). And that the unit is powered by the USB bus, no additional power cable needed. There's a small blue LED signaling both power and activity.I tried the reader out (so far) on Windows 7 (USB3), MacOS (USB3) and FreeBSD (USB2) using a Transcend 16GB SDHC. On both FreeBSD and Win7, I got steady 14.5MB\/s write speeds (likely bound by the card, rather than the reader). MacOS on a 2013 Macbook Pro was mysteriously much slower, but I didn't have a chance to diagnose why.[ A sample was provided to me for review. ]This sort of card-reader is useful to anybody with multiple portable gadgets-- sooner or later you'll need to get data off a device that's broken, or when the battery is dead, or want to do a 32GB transfer and not wait for USB2 on your device, or maybe the cable is missing, or you need to zero out the memory card before giving it away... for all of those scenarios, a card reader like this one is very useful.

It's wired straight into the body and it's made from that plastic that starts to turn white when it's under stress. Even right out of the box there's a bit of white starting to show up at the bend.

This one is a hit!  It was able to transfer data even from my oldest cards, and at the 3.0 speed it promised.  I especially liked how the usb cable simply folds over and locks into the unit making it small, very lightweight, and easy to travel with.  Any other readers have always had long cords I've had to wrap around and they come loose and end up with spaghetti cords in my case.  This one stays the small puck it starts out with.  Bright white labels are perfect for quickly finding the correct slot, and the storage under the lid lets me keep one of each size if I like an extra or blank one handy.

Way to go Sabrent, coming up with innovative products for us.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Sabrent USB 3 card reader is a very nice reader. In terms of connection, just plug the USB cable (attached to the device) to your computer. If you want USB 3 speeds, you MUST plug this into a USB 3 capable port. If you plug into a USB 2 port it will still function, however it will only run at USB 2 speeds for all devices.That being said, the majority of memory cards I have tap out in terms of speed whether I am using the internal card reader on my XPS 8500 or this external reader. In this case, the card reader speed is not the constraint, my memory cards are.The reader is quite light and us easily portable. I use it with my Surface Pro 3 now to add the ability to copy files from my camera's memory cards to my Surface Pro 3. It works beautifully.I don't like the packaging, as it is that nasty clam shell plastic that's difficult to open. I don't know why Sabrent chooses this packing as it's really geared towards anti-theft. Since Sabrent really only sells on-line that I can see, I don't think theft is an issue.Despite the packaging, this card reader is a great deal. It offers multiple card options (SD\/MMC, MicroSD and CF) and is highly portable.Recommended.I received a free sample for review purposes from Sabrent.","rating":5},{"comment":"Sabrent provided a sample of this USB 3.0 card reader for evaluation, but unfortunately I can't recommend it very highly.  The reader has a short integral USB cord, and ports for compact flash (CF), SD, and micro SD cards.  Beneath a plastic a flip up cover, is a compartment with dedicated storage spaces for one CF, one SD, and one micro SD card.When you insert a micro SD card into the reader, it smoothly and securely clicks into place, and the chances of it accidentally falling out are remote.  For the SD card slot, the card slides in  about 0.4\", and there is no positive \"click\".  The card may not fall out, but I would feel more comfortable, if it went in a little deeper.Unfortunately, there are some significant issues with the CF card slot.  There are guides that are intended to slide into the slots on the sides of the CF cards, but they are too short and don't extend far enough to do a very good job.  It isn't that easy to slide a CF card into the reader, and have it mate smoothly with the 50 pins.  When the pins do not align properly with the holes in the CF card, damage can occur to the contact points.  If a pin is bent, you might be able to straighten it out, but if a pin is broken, replacement is probably your only option.After I inserted a couple of different CF cards, I took a look at the pins, and a couple of them were already out of alignment, and one was severely bent.  After just a few attempts, the reader was no longer useable.  This is pretty much a deal breaker, as I can't recommend any reader that might damage a card.Based on past experience, Sabrent usually does a better job of design than this.  Unfortunately, 2 out of 3 isn't a passing grade.  That may seem harsh, but if your high priced CF card is ruined, you may not be in a very forgiving mood.","rating":2},{"comment":"Great hub for carrying around if you don't need USB 3.0 and a 4 port hub will do. I was impressed with how small and lightweight this hub is. It's simple and it just works.Note that it is just a basic hub, there aren't even any LED lights on it. Also, since there is no external power connector, you wouldn't want to plug in a bunch of high-power devices... but for low power USB devices like mice and keyboards, it works great.I would recommend this device when portability is a top concern, USB 3.0 is not needed, and you won't be plugging in &#34;high-power&#34; USB devices.NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"This USB hub has 4 ports on it so you can expand how many devices you can connect to your computer.

If you computer doesn't have a built-in wireless adapter or Bluetooth functionality then you make have a USB dongle for those as well. Needless to say that all these toys utilize USB so you need enough ports to support them.Some important things to note about this USB hub is that it's plug and play and only takes a few seconds to get working with it. It has worked perfectly for me since I started using it. It supports USB 2.0 but not the most recent USB 3.0 technology. If you transfer a lot of files to a external hard drive then you will notice the slower speed but not when connecting a mouse or any other similar devices like that. The average user probably wouldn't notice.The really cool thing about this USB hub is it's incredibly small size. If you take it on the road with you then you will appreciate the micro size of this hub. It's by far the smallest USB hub that I have ever seen and can easily fit into any pocket.

But a hub it is.Dimensions of the body are about 3 7\/8 inches long by slightly over a half inch thick. It takes up very little space for road warriors and travelers, and if you are using a micro OTG connector for your phone or tablet like this one -Micro USB OTG Host Cable to USB 2.0 Adapter- this hib is the perfect way to expand it.I was concerned that this would not really support four devices simultaneously so I plugged it into my ThinkPad T61 running Windows XP. I populated the four ports with a mouse, a keyboard, my digital camera and my Galaxy Note 3 phone. I was especially eager to see if the phone balked because it's finicky about what gets plugged into it when it comes to synching and transferring. No problem with any of the devices (in fact I am writing this review using the external keyboard). I was able to read the camera's memory card with Windows Explorer while transferring a dummy file from my phone.  I did not test any of the claimed transfer speeds.Bottom line: this is small, convenient and works on my old laptop without a hitch. It may be only USB 2.0, but it's plenty fast for my needs.

I tested the speed of a thumb drive with and without the hub and found that it did not slow down transfers.  It is not powered, so it won't be able to handle multiple power draining devices like hard drives, but it isn't intended to be used near a wall outlet anyway.

Four ports in something that looks like I broke off a piece of Kit Kat.  I can't believe they can shrink it that small.It's got a short cord and is bus powered.  That means it uses the power on the USB port.  If you have devices that draw a lot of power, it might overwhelm the hub.  I have a card reader, Bluetooth dongle, microphone, and fingerprint reader attached to it right now and it handles those all at once just fine.  The only thing that it doesn't play nice with is my Logitech Universal Receiver.  That thing is very finicky, so I'm not surprised.I love the portability factor.  It doesn't take up any space and hardly weighs a thing.  That makes it ideal for laptops and netbooks.  I'm using it right now for my Windows 7 PC, but for desktops, I prefer something with a longer cord.This product was provided for review by Sabrent.","rating":5},{"comment":"Seems like computers these days never have enough USB ports, and more and more accessories need one to plug into. Hence, I was glad to get the chance to try this product.I was impressed with how small and compact it is. I like the short connection wire as it allows it to sit nicely on top of the computer without a large dangling wire.This is a perfect accessory for the Raspberry Pi microcontroller. If you have played with the Pi you know that it has only two USB ports, and you need to plug in a keyboard, mouse, and wireless dongle. So, before you even get going you need three USB ports and have only two. I really like using this unit because it is so small and companct, and makes the perfect companion to the Raspberry pi.","rating":5},{"comment":"As usual I received this unit free for purposes of review.  Despite that kindness I give my candid feedback below.* This hub is TINY.  By a factor of 3 it's the smallest I've seen.* Despite that small size, the ports leave plenty of room for cords to be plugged in.  No cramping here.* Obviously, this is a USB 2.0 Hub so don't expect awesome speed from it.* From a charging perspective, there was a measured 20% loss in output when comparing the raw USB charging output with the output through the hub when only one device was connected.  This may or may not be important to you but it's worth noting.In summary, given the pricepoint I find exceptionally little to complain about in this tiny device.","rating":5},{"comment":"Timely delivery.

This product is so small and lightweight, I've added it to the laptop case and replaced a larger, heavier one I travel with.  This hub was able to charge cellphone (galaxy - 3 different models), while having the mouse dongle, and plugged into the printer.  Loving it!  It also was able to transfer data and files between laptop and thumb drives without any problems.  I used the hub with the Sabrent 3.0 Card Reader, transferred photos off my SD and micro SD card with no trouble.  No CD, no drivers to download, just plug and use, couldn't be simpler.  After reading the warning about not charging the ipad, I was concerned about it charging the Kindle Fire HDX, but I plugged it in and it charged.  Plus!!  For the price, this is just about perfect.","rating":5},{"comment":"Trying to add extra USB 2 ports to a portable computer? Be it a tablet, laptop or other USB capable device, then the Sabrent 4 port hub, with it's light weight and easy portability is a great option for sure.I plugged this into my Surface Pro 3 and it was recognized immediately, no drivers needed. I've since plugged it into an older Surface Pro and my Windows 8.1 Dell XPS. The experience was the same. I then plugged it into my Windows 7 work laptop. No problems there either.Transfer speed is no better or worse than other USB 2 hubs.Just keep in mind, if you plug this into a USB 3 port, it will only work as fast as the slowest part, so in this case it will run as a USB2 hub because that's what it is.I can't stress how light this is. The ability to add 4 ports to my Surface Pro 3, so I can charge multiple devices from the SP 3, adds to the utility of it. Would it be great to be USB 3? Sure, but for me, it's not needed at all.Great device, easy to use and great portability.Recommended.I received a free sample for review purposes from Sabrent.","rating":5},{"comment":"Amazing price. I use this to recharge all my electronics at night in the same spot. I love, love, love that it does not have an LED light. Others I have used do and the light is so bright it lights up the whole room.Simplicity with this is the beauty of it, small, sleek, and powerful.","rating":5},{"comment":"It seems like there are more and more USB devices I need to use with my computer. Just today, I had a USB mouse, a label printer and a Bluetooth adapter plugged into my laptop. That took up all 3 of my USB ports and left no room for my external portable USB speaker. And my Surface Pro only has one USB port! That's why I was delighted to have the opportunity to review this slim, bar-style USB hub.I was surprised to see just how slim and lightweight this hub is! That's a big plus when traveling with my Surface Pro because this will fit into my small carrying case. It plugs into a USB port and gives you three additional ports for a total of 4 ports from one. It doesn't need an external power supply and there are no drivers to install because it's plug and play. The drivers are installed the first time you plug it in.I plugged in 4 different USB devices and all ports worked perfectly however, I did get a message on my Kindle screen that it was plugged into a low power port and therefor wouldn't charge while in use and would charge slowly when not in use. Because the power from one USB port is divided into 4 ports, you should assume that it won't charge any device very quickly, but the devices can be used while plugged into this hub.Although this is USB 2.0 rather than the faster USB 3.0, it will still work in a USB 3.0 port - just not at USB 3.0 speeds.NOTE: Anyone with a computer will find this to be very handy and even though I was provided a sample of this hub for reviewing purposes, I liked it so much I just ordered 3 more for other family members.","rating":5},{"comment":"If USB 2.0 isn't an issue, and you're looking for a compact portable hub, that isn't very expensive, take a look at Sabrent 4 port USB 2.0 hub.  The base with the USB ports is quite small, only 3.8\" long.  The 9 inch connecting cord, is long enough to be convenient for using with a laptop.This device is great for taking on trips, because it provides a measure of versatility, and doesn't take up a lot of space.  The hub can be used for both power and data, although transfer speeds might not be the greatest.A sample was provided for evaluation, and I feel that this product's near 5 star aggregate rating, is well deserved.","rating":5},{"comment":"This is an interesting device in that it is like a Bluetooth receiver for playing audio but instead it uses WiFi and DLNA and AirPlay.You power it via a USB power source (like a power bank, PC USB port, or USB charger) and it creates a wireless WiFi network that you then connect your device to. You can then send audio to it through DLNA or AirPlay. It's quite small and lightweight, and has no built-in rechargeable battery. The USB power cable on the device is only a little over 3 inches and when not plugged into power the cable can be kept plugged into a port on the receiver itself, which is handy for storage and when it's not in use.The big \"pro\" is that the quality is better because it is not compressed like Bluetooth. It sounds great with my Sony professional headphones (the same jack that you plug the headphones into is also a 3.5mm line out jack). The downside is that it's a bit more hassle to disconnect from your normal WiFi network and connect to the device's WiFi network (which took awhile to show up on my iPad mini)... and when you do this you'll lose your WiFi Internet connection (but see the UPDATE below) so you won't be able to stream from the Internet if you rely on WiFi to do so.So it does what it says and quality is impressive and so is the size and portability of the device. If the WiFi connection method works well for you then I think you will be quite happy with the device. If you don't need the best sound quality then you may be better off with a simpler Bluetooth receiver (I would recommend one with aptX).By the way, there are two small LEDs on the device - a blue one labeled \"Audio\" and a red one labeled \"WiFi\".UPDATE 2014-07-09: I found out that you can connect this device to the Internet by connecting to its own WiFi network and then using a browser to go to the IP address on the bottom of the unit (mine was 192.168.168.1) and connecting to a wireless network. When you then connect to the Sabrent's WiFi network you will have Internet access. Unfortunately AirPlay doesn't seem to work on Internet connected WiFi network - you still have to connect to the Sabrent's own WiFi network... but the receiver does remember the network if you unplug it then plug it back in.NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"This little device is a circular WiFi receiver with a USB cable attached. The main purpose of this device is to utilize the AirPlay feature that is built-in to apple products like an iPhone or iPad to stream music without wireless. This gives you a better range than Bluetooth technology that is limited to about 25-30 feet. I have many devices that utilize Bluetooth and I like the technology and it's very convenient but after about 20 feet the audio will start to break up. In addition you have to have a Bluetooth compatible device. With this device you can connect it to any device that has a audio jack. That gives you some additional options on what types of devices you can use it on. The only catch is that you have to have the USB receiver plugged into a powered USB port. Unfortunately that limits the possibilities of when and where you can use it. The one way you can get around that is by plugging into a portable battery pack. If you do that then you can take it anywhere.Set up was a breeze you just connect to it like connecting to a new Wifi connection. Once that is done then you simply have to open Pandora or iTunes or whatever music program it is that you use, hit the AirPlay button and select the one that says Sabrent. Then instead of sending the music to your iPhone or iPad internal speaker it will transmit it to your Sabrent WiFi receiver. The sound quality and range is good and so complaints as far as that goes. My only comment is that its just a little more hassle than Bluetooth and most of the newer products are already Bluetooth compatible. This WiFi receiver does exactly what it's supposed to do but I would only suggest it for those that wish to stream music to a device that isn't Bluetooth compatible.Sample provided for review.","rating":4},{"comment":"The world is going wireless and Sabrent wants you to join the public without spending too much money in the process. This very product is very similar to the Duo Bluetooth Receiver by CoolStream and it's ironic that they both showed up in the same time frame. It's the Geek God showing me a sign of comparing them to see which one is better for you and I - the average consumer.The little gadget that I want to share with you guys and girls today is the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver (WF-RADU). There's a lot to talk about something so small and very affordable. Let's get started, shall we?What's in the Box?Sabrent is known for packing their products very well to ensure that it will arrive at your house safe and still in one piece. Other competitors should take note and step up their packing game due to the fact that the customer will judge a product first on it's impression. Anyways, you will receive the:- Sabrent Wi-Fi Audio Receiver (WF-RADU)- User Manual- Customer Support InformationThey didn't include a lot mainly because this little gadget works with hardly anything extra.Where Does the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Exceed?Unlike it's competitor, CoolStream, this little gadget plays audio via your home Internet connection rather than Bluetooth. This means that more of your devices are able to play audio to a pair of wired speakers that can now become wireless with the simply addition of this little gadget by Sabrent.This means you can use your smartphone, tablet, Windows, and Mac computer mainly because the audio that is played to the little gadget is via AirPlay. Sabrent has even taken note that Apple has this pre-configured in their iDevices (i.e. iPod touch, iPhone, and iPad) as well as making sure that Android users has this benefit, too. On the other hand, Windows users are out of luck but that's a whole different story.Due to the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver playing music via the connection of Wi-Fi I have noticed that the signal was a lot stronger than Bluetooth. My Internet speed is pretty fast and the connection is solid no matter if I used a smartphone or a tablet.Where Does the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Lack?AirPlay is known for playing multimedia from iOS devices and since the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver depends on this it kind of kick some people in the butt. Basically, those users, like myself, that own a Windows Phone won't have the luxury to use this little gadget like those that own an iDevice or\/and Android device. I will continue to search for apps that use AirPlay for Windows Phone until then this isn't a recommended product for Windows Phone users.Besides the lacking support for Windows Phone users I also see a BIG difference from their main competitor, CoolStream, which is that there's no built-in battery. The Duo Bluetooth Receiver from CoolStream offers a built-in 8-hour battery while the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver requires you to plug it into a USB port (i.e. Computer, Wall Outlet, etc.).How the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Fit in my Life?Personally, I don't see myself using this gadget mainly because the lack of support for Windows Phone as well as being required to plug it into a USB port just to power it. I do have the option to bring a portable battery charger but that's a bit much and I don't see myself having a big interest with it.I believe that this gadget fits better for a user that have a pair of speakers that are not in use but are near an outlet or\/and computer and want them to use them again with the help of the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver. Basically, they will be able to control the audio in their home from anywhere inside and outside of their house.Why Should You Purchase this for Yourself?Do I recommend it? Well, yes and no; those that own an iOS and Android device should consider picking one up for themselves very soon but those that own a Windows Phone should wait until support is given either from Sabrent or an app in the Windows Store.","rating":4},{"comment":"SABRENT has created a small, lightweight receiver that transforms any powered speaker or stereo receiver into an AirPlay-enabled system. It is a WiFi receiver so any of your devices set to use WiFi can use this. The instructions on the video included on the Amazon page are clear and easy to follow. It is not simply a plug and play device, but with a bit of patience putting it into use is relatively simple. The sound of course depends on the speakers you are using, but that is not a factor in this receiver. The most useful application seems to be for cars, but anywhere a WiFi bridge is needed. best suited for vehicles in my opinion, but is certainly not limited to that use. I gave it five stars because it works exactly per the product description's claims and is a breeze to install (my own fumbling notwithstanding.)As the package insert states, `Better than Bluetooth - AirPlay is lossless (no audio compression), has better range, no pairing limitations and supports multi-users; anyone can play DJ. Will work seamlessly with your existing Bluetooth hands-free setup (music will pause for incoming\/outgoing calls and resume when call ends).' Grady Harp, July 14","rating":5},{"comment":"This audio receiver provides a novel approach to wireless audio transmission, using WiFi rather than bluetooth. This item plugs in to any USB outlet for its power source. Once plugged in it can be linked to a wireless audio transmission source such as an iPad\/iPhone or Android phone\/tablet.  For this connection to be made you need to go into your phone\/tablet WiFi settings and choose the Sabrent device from the available WiFi connections that appear. Then, you can use DLNA or Airplay supporting apps to play the audio and the audio should stream wirelessly to the receiver, which will play the sound through a headphone or speaker that you connect to the 3.5 mm output jack on the Sabrent receiver. When I tested this following the included instructions it worked smoothly. The sound quality is very good, better than bluetooth since the WiFi doesn't compress the audio. The drawback is that you can't have your device connected to any Internet WiFi source while it's connecting to the WiFi audio receiver. This item is also limited by the USB only power and the short length of the USB cable that folds in to the receiver. This could be used in your home as well as in a car where the vehicle has a 3.5mm auxiliary audio input jack and a USB plugin. This is a nice alternative to have available for wireless audio transmission from select devices. This receiver has red and blue LED indicator lights to show the presence of the WiFi connection and the audio transmission. Perhaps in the future this will be upgraded to offer more options, such as supporting other devices and offering a bluetooth connection for streaming audio from a webstream. It currently comes with a 1 year warranty and tech support in case you have trouble setting it up.

This device is basically used to convert a non-wireless device of any kind (home stereo or powered speakers) to wireless play, providing you've also got a smart device.I followed the instructions and got it to work immediately. First of all, this device needs a power source. I used a power bank, so I plugged the attached USB cord into a power bank. Now that it's powered, it sends out a wifi signal. I used an iPhone, found the wifi signal and connected it. Next step is to plug in your audio system, either speakers or home audio (AUX in via 3.5mm audio cable, not included). Lastly use AirPlay, an app you can download to play, and you can have music played from your smart device.Though I used iOS, it also supposed Android devices and DLNA.

I used this system with a 3.5mm to RCA adapter cable to accomplish my goal and it has worked brilliantly.  One thing to keep in mind, you will need to keep this unit powered via a USB port, but for me that is simple enough.Setup to your sound output system is as easy as connecting the cable, connecting your device to the Sabrent will follow similar setup to that of connecting a device to a wireless network.  After plugging in the system and letting it boot up, on your Wi-Fi enabled device (phone, tablet, etc) search for the Sabrent_A1AE network and connect.  After successful connection, you can now play music wirelessly to your sound system.  I'm considering getting a second unit for the car because of how smart this setup is.  What makes this unit `better' than Bluetooth receivers is that Wi-Fi can offer better quality sound transfer and has a greater range than the max of 30ft you can get from a typical Bluetooth receiver.Overall, a solid performer and offers a unique solution to improve upon the myriad of Bluetooth receivers on the market today.[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]","rating":5},{"comment":"This little WiFi receiver is a niche device, designed to use with Apple AirPlay.

I tried this out with two Android apps that provide AirPlay capabilities and neither worked (they wereiMediaShare PersonalandAirBuddy). That is not the fault of this device, though. Since it works perfectly with a real Apple device the apps were the problem.Do be aware that you need to connect to this receiver via WiFi. For home use you have to choose between this or your router,  but for in your vehicle that should not be a problem. You can connect the output to any powered speaker or sound system using the 3.5mm jack. If your powered speaker employs RCA jacks you can use an adapter like anSF Cable, 12 feet 3.5mm Stereo Male to Two RCA Male Splitter Cable.Bottom line: this is a relatively small and lightweight receiver that can transform any powered speaker or stereo receiver into an AirPlay-enabled system.

I suspect something similar to how wireless memory cards like Eye-Fi does its dirty job.  First thing you do to connect is to plug this thing to a USB power source, it could be your PC, a wall AC adapter, car adapter or a portable battery pack.  It will start broadcast signal so go to your device's setting and go to WiFi. You will see it as SABRENT_a340.  The good thing is that it pops up immediately unlike Bluetooth that you wait for a few seconds before you can see it, sometimes you wonder if it is working or not.  One last thing is to press Airplay and connect to SABRENT_a340. You can then connect a 3.5mm cable to play it through a speaker or straight to your earphone\/headphones.  It would be nice if a 3.5mm cable is included in the box but it is not so you have to provide your own.Pros:- It doubles the range of Bluetooth.  I can play music 50-60 feet away from the receiver.- Built-in USB cableCons:- It doesn't have a built-in internal battery so you can use it without the need of being constantly plugged to a power source.  I have Bluetooth receivers that are smaller than can run for hours from its internal battery.- You cannot browse the internet while connected paired to the receiver.- You cannot play iTunes radio or any music stored in the cloud- Thin audio.

If the phone stays put, then everything is fine. Probably the buffer being empty. (This is driving)- There is a lag of about a second in the audio. So if you are listening to Apple \/ Google maps, your directions will be a second later, but usually 1 second doesn't make much of a difference.- I wish the name of the Wifi could be modified.

Once I realized what it was asking for it was ludicrously easy to setup.* Instructions are sufficient and get you where you need to go quickly and easily.* Unit is compact and works beautifully* The only thing that confuses me is the use case for this item in the first place.  So the device emits a wifi network signal.  You connect your iPhone to that network and you can use Apple's AirPlay to transmit audio.  Great!  The only problem for me is that all my audio is streamed from the net.  Which I just had to disconnect from in order to connect to the wifi provided by the speaker.

I trialed this receiver with both android and I-devices.  Both operating systems worked just as stated.  The first audio receiver would never keep the wifi on long enough to connect.  With a call to support, and lots of patience on their end as I worked through several troubleshooting efforts, a new receiver was on it's way.  The replacement worked perfectly the first time right out of the box.  I tried to use the receiver in numerous situations, with a variety of devices (old and new), and never had a moment of trouble.  The sound never lagged, dropped, or weakened.  I did find I lost the signal from the cellphone when a call came in, but I find that happens with some apps and not a real issue for me at all.  Being able to add wifi to technology I never thought could be connected has opened so many options to me.  I believe this product is even better sound quality than the Bluetooth speaker I used previously.  The Bluetooth would lag or weaken and that never happened with the Sabrent receiver.  I can comfortably give this 5 stars as the device works just as stated, and the support was excellent when the first device did not work.  Many times I've purchased something and gotten little or no support - but that is not the case with Sabrent!  Their friendly, knowledgeable and patient support staff willingly worked with me, and treated me with respect which many companies fail to do.

Here's why.1. A bluetooth pairing is effortless to set up. This requires much more effort. I like things as simple as possible.2. I use a wireless bluetooth receiver connected to the AUX port in my car. That receiver has an internal battery that will last about 12 hours, so I don't have to keep it connected to a USB port. No USB power source is required (except when I need to recharge it), as is true of this product. One less piece of equipment.3. Bluetooth works on a wide variety of devices while Airplay is proprietary to Apple. I have my share of Apple devices--iPhone, iPad, Macbook and Apple TV so I am very familiar with it. One of the main &#34;selling points&#34; of Airplay is lossless audio. Without getting into the technical differences between Airplay and Bluetooth, let me say that unless you're talking about something like a home theatre system, as a practical matter I don't think there's a perceptible difference in the sound. One review says that bluetooth is &#34;tinny&#34;--but not on my car stereo system or on a host of wireless bluetooth speakers that I use.Bottom line: This works, but for me is not any better than a bluetooth receiver, which is a lot simpler and easier to use, and also works effortlessly on non Apple devices without having to download any extra apps.","rating":3},{"comment":"Want to add wireless audio streaming to your home theater or home stereo that has 3.5mm input? Maybe you want to stream music in your car from your Android or iPhone? This little beauty adds wireless capability to a wireless-incapable device with ease.The only caveat is that it needs a USB power connection to run. This is good if you have a spare charger and a spare power outlet, bad if you don't. It's not a big deal to work around, but it is something you will want to keep in mind.Connecting to the device is easy. Just plug it into power, let it power on. Connect the 3.5mm output to your audio setup with a 3.5mm input. On your phone or Wi-Fi enabled audio player, turn on Wi-Fi. Search for the Sabrent_A1AE and connect. Now fire up your music app, such as Music on the iPhone, and play away. Well, make sure your stereo is powered up and on the right input (or car stereo or surround receiver and so on).The nice thing about this is that it uses Wi-Fi. This means it doesn't have the compression issues you might hear or experience on a Bluetooth connection.Another option you can use is to create fake wireless headphones. This is kind of a joke of an option, as you need a power source, but if you want to cope with it, this can be done. I tried plugging this into one of the myriad of &#34;power banks&#34; I have. It powers up and allows you to connect. Once connected, plug in headphones and now you have headphones that are receiving wireless audio over a completely wired connection on the receiving end. It works, but not really what this seems to have been designed for.Another caveat you might have is that with the way the device is designed, you can't really have more than one of these in the house and connected at one time. The problem is that they all use the same wireless network name and static IP address, meaning you will never be sure which you are connecting to. Trial and error I guess. As I don't have the need for this, it's not a big deal for me, but for some it might be a deal breaker.Works well, sounds good and is easy to configure.Recommended.I received a free sample for review purposes from Sabrent.","rating":5},{"comment":"I've never seen something quite like this before... The Sabrent Wifi Audio Receiver is an interesting wifi-enabled receiver that gives you the ability to use your home network to play music from your mobile devices without having to be tethered to the actual iPad\/iPhone\/iPod. In the right situation, this could be very convenient.Set-up for the basic usage is simple. You plug the receiver into a USB port or charger, and that activates the wifi signal. The 3.5mm plug can be used with a set of headphones or an external speaker to pick up the music being streamed. Since I was using it with my iPad, I went into Settings and found the wifi signal that was being broadcast, and connected to it. From there, I could use AirPlay to stream my downloaded music to the speaker\/headphones. I was surprised at how easy it was to use without any significant configuration.The downside of the design is that you need to connect your mobile device's wifi target to the Sabrent wifi signal, which means you won't be connected to your regular wifi for surfing or other uses. This limits you to what you can do while you're streaming music. Ideally you'd probably have your iPhone streaming to the receiver while using your iPad for surfing or other uses.Since you have to commit your device to the Sabrent signal, this isn't the &#34;perfect&#34; solution to streaming music to speakers. If you need\/want to do music\/surfing at the same time, maybe bluetooth would be better. But this is an interesting concept, and it's a device I plan on playing around with further.Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free","rating":4},{"comment":"...all part of the package that comes with a premium-priced portable Bluetooth speaker.The market is crowded with portable Bluetooth speakers. Many will deliver acceptable sound for most users, and even ardent audiophiles understand the limitations of physics as personal portable music relies on both a lossy format (.mp3) additionally impacted by the compression of Bluetooth audio streaming, all delivered to a small piece of hardware. But if you want to part with a few more dollars and up your overall wireless portable music experience, the features and sound quality of this speaker go a long way towards justifying its position at the higher end of speakers working in the same domain.Starting with what matters most: the sound. The SR20 offers the best sound I've heard from a wireless speaker...period. Whether acoustic, amplified, orchestral...whatever, the dual amps inside this speaker (which are no doubt responsible for driving its weight to more than 4.5 pounds) provide clear separation of frequencies (one drives bass, the other drives mid and high range frequencies). The speaker also contains two pieces of enhancement technology. The questionably named \"Roar\" button increases both volume and spatial\/presence effects in a pleasing way (and the the expense of battery life). Also available is  \"Terra Bass\" function, which provides specialized bass treatment at lower volume levels (old timers will remember \"loudness\" buttons on systems from the dark ages).Bluetooth pairing was effortless with both an Android phone and an iPod Nano. The SR20 will pair with two devices simultaneously. Pause the content on one, start the content on the other and it instantly switches programming sources.This speaker is a also a digital music player via a microSD card. While it did not like the default file system directly imported from my Windows machine, once I reloaded the files outside of directory structure, it immediately recognized and played them. If you have a microSD card, this device also doubles as a voice recorder (saving files to the card in .wav files) for both spoken voice and phone calls. If your phone is the source of your music, it automatically pauses music and you can take your call via the speaker (assuming you want to share).Additional features include a bedtime mode (auto shutoff after 15 or 30 minutes) and an \"alert\" function that will intermittently increase the sound level, presumably to keep you from nodding off at your desk. It also has what might be the oddest function ever...a built in siren.Creative deserves extra credit for including outstanding user documentation. Both the quick start guide and more detailed user guides are nicely illustrated, well organized and understandably written.You can also integrate this speaker to be an output device from both Mac and PC computers via the included USB port. If your laptop has the sound quality of most laptops...the goodness of this idea is obvious.Keeping it one step from perfection was the puzzling decision to place many of the function buttons on the rear panel of the speaker. This is not an issue when you are controlling content from a connected device, but is rather annoying when playing from the SD card and you decide the time has come to skip forward or back. Overall, this is a minor gripe for a speaker that delivers major performance.Note: this item provided for review purposes.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Blaster's latest was sent to me as a 'for review' unit. Of course, they never hinted that a positive review as expected in return.The point of the attached imperfect video (sorry, had to take off for our vacation so I could only afford one take) should, I hope, help those interested decide which of the leading 'big sound' portable speakers they'd prefer, the 'competition' beingBose SoundLink Bluetooth Speaker III. Speaking for myself, while both are 'good', I found the Blaster's sound a lot more organic, so to speak. It's louder and more powerful too even on this recording, made with its 'roar' enhancement off.I hope the first part of the video puts to rest the charge advanced by some professional reviewer that the Roar bass is weak. It's not. But I'm not going to say words. Just listen and decide.Now, for what the video's image and sound don't show and still in a Blaster vs. Bose comparison mode, the Roar is smaller and lighter which is a good thing given that its sound is fuller and louder. It also lays down flat vs. Bose's stand up operating mode so the Blaster is more stable. The Blaster seems to be selling for a better price at the time I'm writing this.It also comes with lots of features, and I'm sure I'm going to miss some of them:- Long battery life: should last for about 8 hours, according to specs.- Charges either off its proprietary solution or, slowly, off a computer through the USB port.- Bluetooth: of course. The video was playing off a Bluetooth pairing with a Chromebook playing Pandora. It supports various pairing modes, including one that would allow TWO phones.- Phone support, no surprise there, with most functions implemented through tapping one button.- NFC (Near Field Communication): if your phone has it, you can play stuff off your phone by simply placing it near the Blaster.- Voice recorder: yes, it does that. The built-in mic will capture your voice and record it to a MicroSD card.- MicroSD playback: allows random play (my favorite) or sequential with the ability to skip to the next song or folder\/album- Panic alarm: don't know who will ever think of pushing the panic alarm button on the Blaster rather than screaming 'Help' in a panic situation but... well... it's there.- Charger mode: believe it or not, you can use the Blaster to charge your phone through a USB portLike I said, I suspect I might have missed a feature or 2 but, in the end, what really counts in an external speaker is sound quality, portability, ease of operation and price and on all of the above Blaster's Roar is outstanding.Oh, of course, I forgot to mention the Roar button. It's what you use if you want to expand the sound to 'fill the room'. It works and it does seem to spread the sound around.P.S. My review mentions an attached video. I am attaching one but my experience with Amazon is that it sometimes takes them a day or 2 to post the video part so, please check later if the video is not there when you are reading this.","rating":5},{"comment":"Imagine having a speaker that can be connected via Bluetooth or NFC, via USB to a desktop PC or laptop, play music files from micro SD cards and even use it to answer calls and record conversations. How about allowing all your friends to share the Bluetooth connectivity.Those are just some a few of the great features. The Creative Blaster Roar has a built-in rechargeable battery. This means you can take it anywhere with you. Take it to the beach, the pool or be the best DJ at your friend&#8217;s party. Need more loudness&#8230;activate the ROAR feature and raise the loudness bar by another level. Don&#8217;t forget about the bass for those that want to feel their music with the TERA Bass feature. Activate both the ROAR and TERA Bass and immerse yourself in rich deep sounding tones.There is an alarm\/siren, sleep mode and the unit will even charge your smartphone. I keep wondering where the mini television is hidden. This machine is truly one-of-a &#8211;kind and incredible to say the least.The design itself was given special attention. It lies down instead of up so the sound can be distributed uniformly. This also allows the bass and mid-ranges to sit low to cause less vibration and more stability.Once you hear the speaker in action, you will truly realize how much creativity and ingenuity went into designing this speaker.Review sample.","rating":5},{"comment":"Received this this week and couldn't be happier.  Read all the reviews and believe what you read.  Well, the excellent one's for sure because this item is well worth the money.  (Did it get any bad reviews?) Not much more to add except you won't be disappointed.","rating":5},{"comment":"Wow...that's about all I have to say.  Having no prior experience with BT speakers before now, I had relatively low expectations despite the glowing reviews.As one of the few reviewers who has actually purchased the speaker and thus has a bit of skin in the game, I can say that I am wholly pleased with this bluetooth speaker.  The overall performance and fidelity is exceptional and exceeds my expectations.While it won't be replacing my floor standing wired speakers, I can see where a pair of these set up in stereo format would create a very pleasing system suitable for many uses.Though I purchased the unit primarily for porch and deck duty, it sounds great in the kitchen and library as well.Thus far I've enjoyed music from disparate artists such as Charles Mingus, Donald Fagen, Simply Red, Lyle Lovett and Red Garland among others. They all sound great.None of my devices feature NFC but thus far I have had no difficulty mating the \"Roar\" with an iPhone, iPad, Kindle HDX and a Chromebook.I won't use many of the features provided on the \"Roar\" but for pure music enjoyment alone it is worth the asking price, imho.Highly recommended from a reasonably critical and picky listener.","rating":5},{"comment":"I've been a long time Creative customer since back in the Sound Blaster sound card days.  I've tried out a lot of wireless Bluetooth speakers and this one is near the best. And it's the cheapest out of all the best that I've tried. And the features are in abundance and it really shows that Creative knows how to do things right. It's just a really nice design with a lot of features that are super useful.The one feature I love and stands out is something I've never seen before, being able to record phone calls. I'm somebody who often wants to record a phone call especially when I'm calling customer service with a problem or complaint. A: because part of me wants to have a record of what we talked about for my own review. B: part of me was uploaded to YouTube if they treat me like a piece of trash. But I've never seen this option on a Bluetooth speaker before and it's just such a great thing to have. And records to your microSD card so that you can remove it and import it into your computer. It simply does the really shows creative put a lot of thought into how we might want to use the speaker.Another feature I find compelling and again a very unique feature for wireless speakers, multiple devices at once. With low-end speakers it's really annoying to have to keep pairing your device when you want to take over command. Special my friends are over and were sharing tunes. What's nice about the Sound Blaster Roar is that you can have more than one user paired at the same time to the speaker. Again another thing that shows Creative with the real thought into what the users want.The sound of the Roar is spectacular maybe not as good as the Bose speaker system I've used before but still pretty good by comparison. Definitely a great speaker you want to take it to a party\/cookout\/beach. It really does put out a lot of sound for a small portable device. It's rather impressive to see what Creative has crammed into such a small device.  A feature I did not get to try out is being able to run two speakers at the same time. To me you want to have sound usually spread across the room and running two speakers in parallel definitely will help saturate the area.What is NFC? Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones and similar devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no more than a few inches.  I don't have NFC on any of my devices so I couldn't test it but I can't wait to get one because pairing via Bluetooth can be a pain in the butt. I'll test it out hopefully when the new iPhone emerges in the fall. But if it works as described as I'm imagining it does I can see myself using it all the time.So in conclusion I love this speaker. And it under $150 at the time of writing this review I think it stacks up against more expensive units by Sony and Boise and it has features that many of them lack. And this is perfect for cookouts with friends or trips to the beach really any time you want to have access to some musical entertainment.Thanks for reading!PS I really think a standout feature of this is the ability to record phone conversations.  This is something I wanted to do for so long and this provides an easy way to get it done.","rating":5},{"comment":"Update 14 July 2014: they have a white paper at creative.com\/roar\/whitepaper.pdfI have no doubt this is where I will put my money. 5 stars! ROAR!!!It is pointless to write another thumbs up review like what the overwhelming majority have done.Thus, for those who would like to look at its cons and how the cons may affect some, here they are:1) No audio volume indicator. It will be good to have some form of LED or even display.2) Too many features can confuse or up the learning curve. Some people just want the features simple, just do it.3) MicroSD Card support is only up to 32GB. If you have higher capacity, it may not work. My tiny 1GB card works.4) MicroSD Card needs to be formatted to FAT\/FAT32. If you by chance have a NTFS one, it may not work.5) MicroSD Card playback lacks controls. You can play, pause, skip to next song, skip to next folder (by pressing and hold the forward button), random\/continous play and that's all.You cannot fast foward play a song and so on. And yes, the buttons at the back are for controlling the card playback, not bluetooth. And you cannot use Bluetooth to control the card playback.Since the buttons are at the back, you could accidentally press back when you wanted to press forward.6) MicroSD Card playback does not support gapless. I know Windows Media Player since day 1 has support for it, same for a certain fruit company's products. My LG phone cannot play gapless too. If you need lossless audio, I am only in luck with wav. My WMA lossless does not work. My mp3 or wma 320kbps works.7) MicroSD Card playback is based on date\/time the file is copied. FIFO. You cannot create a playlist. If you think you want to get this as a full featured jukebox, you might be disappointed. If you don't understand what is FIFO just use bluetooth.8) Bluetooth range is ok, but not always satisfying your expectations. My experience is the range is less than my wireless keyboard\/mouse. If you are in an area full of bluetooth and wifi signals, good luck. If you keep on thinking about why the price is half of the competitor and why it is made in China, you may start losing confidence.9) If you looking at voice recording at 16bit 48kHz, you may want to ask Creative tech support how it could be done.10) Microphone to answer phone call is really ok, just ok only. A tad soft. If you have Soundblaster Axx 200, you will know what is the benchmark.11) To optimally and efficiently charge the roar, you will need to use the supplied AC charger, not any generic 5V 1A.12) Micro USB port is not very strong, just like Nexus 7 (2012). Take care if you plug in and out using USB cable daily.13) The device is a little heavy compared to speakers like Soundblaster Axx 200. If you are neither strong nor careful, let me know the drop test result. I have yet to.14) It is a rectangular box like device that occupies a large footprint compared to speakers like Soundblaster Axx 200. If you prefer a tiny footprint, do not get the Roar. To achieve optimal audio results, you may have to try positioning it near a wall, at a corner of the room and so on.15) Since it can connect to the desktop\/laptop, you might think it can allow you to enjoy SBX effects on your favorite cans. There is no audio jack out. For gamers, there is no scout mode. Finally, changing SBX effects is not available through Android\/iOS app.16) If you connect it to AC power and up the volume, you may find it louder than without AC power.17) If you find it too bassy, you might want to send it back for a refund. I have 2 suggestions. If you just want good mids\/highs, small footprint\/lighter\/more features, better mic, get Soundblaster Axx 200. If you want to set it to neutral, connect to desktop\/laptop, download SBX software (SoundBlaster Control Panel) and tune it.18) If you think it can outperform your 5.1 system\/expensive soundbar, you will find its lack of stereo separation a regret. Solution is buy another Roar with the mega stereo cable to link up for wider soundstage. Note that the mega stereo cable is not an ordinary jack. It is slightly modified.19) The 6000mAh battery is non-removable, not user replaceable unless you are prepared to do soldering. My old Nokia feature phone battery is still working fine. Try to avoid draining the battery to zero too often, this can help to lengthen battery lifespan.20) The 5V 1A output can hardly charge large tablets. If you think of buying this just as a powerbank, think twice. After struggling to fully charge my LG Optimus Pro G (3140mah), it can hardly roar. Meow it goes.21) Battery life is ok, just plain ok. Nowhere near Soundblaster Axx 200. When battery life is low, it cannot output loud enough. You may want to buy a huge capacity powerbank for this.22) It is mainly dark gray in color. No other colors available including the accessories.23) Like any bluetooth device, you may have a device that is not willing to pair with it or you like to hear sudden pause in your music\/audio.24) Like my Soundblaster Axx 200, you may have a certain laptop\/desktop that somehow refuse to interact well with the Roar even after reinstall, reset, change micro USB cable and so on. Oh yes, older USB cables may not work well.25) It is not waterproof. The large horizontal top increases the probability of water invading the drivers.26) My Efergy power monitoring socket finds it consume more power during charging than Soundblaster Axx 200. 2 amplifiers means more power needed. To be fair, it still consumes less power than most 2.1 systems.27) No built-in FM tuner. So many features and yet this is missing. It was the standard in all Creative mp3 players (once upon a time...).20) No frequency response given. Doesn't matter. Certain frequencies are inaudible to humans. Give me a frequency response curve with SNR, that's better. You have a new fan and wants to know its rpm. I prefer to personally experience the wind (coverage, distance, timer, remote control) and noise from it during a hot afternoon.29) Creative is trying to make a comeback. Well, compared to some other brand that can sell very well even with twice this price, this brand still has some way to go. In fact, the Roar that you are getting today is like Roar 1.1 (some features added recently). I will not rule out a Roar 2 coming within a year that functions as a full jukebox too.I will update once I encounter new flaws.Last updated on 11 Jul 2014 :)","rating":5},{"comment":"I've had my hands on a lot of speakers over the years. I've always wanted that high end sound but could never afford the kind of speaker that produced it. I've come close with some shelf speakers but nothing ever came close to that concert hall sound at an affordable price. Until now. Sound Blaster has thought about just about everything that makes the listening experience amazing and easy.Sound: What can I say. It is AMAZING! It has two speakers in the front for high frequency sound (highs), a high excursion driver on top for bass and mid range sound, and two passive radiators on each side to enhance bass levels and widen the soundstage. What all that means is that it is so full and rich that it sounds like it is coming from a speaker grouping that is hundreds of dollars and much bigger. The technology inside is incredible.There are features built-in that make the sound even better when you need it. On top of the Sound Blaster is a ROAR button. That adds a super boost to the sound levels. Perfect for when you need to increase intensity without turning the volume way up and making it distort. Then there is a tera bass button. This is great for adding a little extra thump to your sound. I've been streaming radio and music of all kinds. The sound carries nicely to fill a room (the farther away the better sometimes) and I can hear it clearly across the house.Features: There are two ways to charge this, via the wall plug and USB. It seems to last a long time on one charge which means that portability is great. It has multiple inputs for music\/sound. There is an audio jack (and audio cable - provided), a micro SD card, USB input, and bluetooth. It also will reconnect via NFC (near field communication) if you have already connected via bluetooth to your device. Just a tap from your phone to the corner of the speaker and it will auto connect.It has the ability to record as well. While I haven't tried this feature, it could be used to record a bedtime story for a child. This is great because it has a sleep function where it will slowly lower the volume for 15 or 30 minutes until it turns off.It has a built in alarm (not sure why but if you are camping or stuck somewhere and in need of a loud noise...) again, I haven't tried this out. I don't want to alarm the neighbors!Lots of features, amazing sound, compact size. And it comes with a carry case as well! This is well worth the investment.I was provided a unit for evaluation, testing and review.","rating":5},{"comment":"I'm a \"get it out of the box and just plug and go\" kind of guy and know that a lot of other people are also. Everything worked great (e.g., Bluetooth pairing) but I made the mistake of setting this speaker up on its side rather than as illustrated. Oddly, it still worked great especially on a hardwood table. But it is designed to sit horizontally. You've been warned!Sound quality: This speaker has some of the best dynamics I've heard from almost ANY speaker, with the only thing in question being its volume. Yes, it can still get hugely loud, but don't expect to have dance hall booming bass, especially in large rooms. That's not a drawback, in my book, rather it's a description of most portable speakers' capabilities. The most comparable speaker I've used prior to the Sound Blaster Roar would be theSony SRSX5which is similarly priced, but with a lot less features. If the specific features of the Sound Blaster Roar aren't needed, you might want to look into the SRSX5. Both can boom, but don't expect to use either in a club setting.Features: More than you'll likely ever need, but enough to have a ton of fun with. Some of the early reviews mention things that are no longer available (e.g., the mode that generates random sounds to keep you awake). Some features work better than others (ask in the comments and I can go in depth on individual features). I really like the ability to use this as a boombox by inserting a micro-SD card with your personalized playlist. Like other units with this feature, you don't have a lot of control, mostly just skipping forward or backwards. But, just make different playlists for different chips and you have your updated version of the 70's era cassette tape boom boxes.The ability to record incoming cell calls is VERY cool if you have that need and have found how difficult it can be to record cell calls. Just insert a chip, and when an incoming call comes in press the record button and you're set (all legal issues for your state on recording conversations are on you). Recording voice from the built-in microphone is just as easy. The microphone picked up my voice easily, as well as ambient noise from the kitchen about 20 feet away.Super fun unit with lots of bells and whistles; sound (if you don't need huge volume) is top of the line. 5 out of 5 stars.Sample received for review.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Creative Sound Blaster Roar puts out impressive audio for something so small, and not just impressive in volume, but in quality and in user customization, as well.There are two 1.5 inch high frequency drivers facing forward and a 2.5 in. midrange\/bass driver directed upwards with bass ports on each end for a very deep and wide soundstage for a one-piece stereo speaker.  There are two dedicated amplifiers to support the very accurate and even sound reproduction.  There is no distortion even at higher volumes.However, the sound can be easily customized.  If a bass emphasis is desired, there are two buttons to adjust bass and the effect of overall intensity.  The TERA bass button increases bass dynamically at lower to moderate volumes and in rooms with poor acoustics.  The ROAR button boosts overall loudness and creates a more open sound and is very enjoyable even at close range.  These functions can be activated separately or simultaneously.Further customization is supported by the Sound Blaster Control Panel software when connected by USB cable to a computer.  The software provides nine preset profiles for music, films, and gaming, and these profile settings can be calibrated to taste.  It's a complete sound control panel but in software form.Bluetooth 4.0 with AptX and AAC codecs connects painlessly as \"SB Roar SR20A\" and will also support NFC connections.  Wired connections can be made to a computer either with the included USB cable or to any audio device with a 3.5 mm jack with an included audio cable.  Another option is using a microSD card to play MP3, WAV, and WMA files.  There is a built-in microphone that works well for calling and teleconferencing.  Other fun features include random loud sounds mode, bedtime mode, siren, and voice recorder.The large-capacity 6,000 mAh lithium-ion battery provides seven to eight hours of listening at normal volumes over Bluetooth and there is a 1 A USB port for charging small electronic devices, such as a paired smartphone.It ships in a nice frustration-free box that can be used for storage and includes a user guide.  It has a one year warranty.  Accessories available include aproprietary cablefor pairing and amesh carrying bagwith a shoulder strap and hand loop for portable use.It is difficult to compare the Sound Blaster Roar to other portable speakers because it is a big step up in audio quality and features from anything I have seen in its price range, making it an excellent choice for daily use as a primary personal speaker, especially where space is limited, as well as for portable use.  It is very handsome sitting on my desk and looks and feels much more expensive than it is.Creative provided a Sound Blaster Roar for evaluation and review.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Sound Blaster Roar is one of the most perfectly designed portable Bluetooth speaker system with so many extras, it tough to know where to begin. Creative has included so many cool extra functions I realized that I'll never have to have another portable stereo Bluetooth speaker again.These are some of the features that just blew me away.It pairs quickly with the push of a button.The sound is perfect. Absolutely. When I did maximize my phones volume and the Sound Blaster Roar, there was a bit of distortion, but I find this to be a good feature. It gives you the limit of its sound capability - and it is high. There are five drivers powered by two completely separate amplifiers! The bass is very strong and distinct with a built-in subwoofer. The bass comes out the sides and top, the mid-range shouts from the top along with some treble and the highs\/treble comes out through two stereo speakers in the front. There is the &#34;ROAR&#34; button which is a booster. Your highs really become pronounced and the bass is slightly louder. The increase in clarity is what really stood out. It's almost overkill.It also works as a speakerphone, which is not unusual but the sound is perfect.There is a miscroSD card slot to store music and it can play MP3, WAV and WMA files. You can probably actually store more music on the card than on your Bluetooth device (32 GB). You can plug this into your PC directly and connect it over the USB and work it as a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). You can play music and charge it at the same time, saving battery power.There is a USB port that will charge a Smartphone, but this drains battery power, unless your unit is plugged into a power source. Easy enough!There is a siren\/alarm that is activated by switching the speaker to the &#34;ARM&#34; control. This is part of the overkill, but someone will love this.There is a microphone if you want to record conversations or music\/podcasts. To be honest, the sound recording quality of music is not that great, but calls come through great.The &#34;Roar&#34; is like a brick in size (2.2&#34; X 7.9&#34; X 4.5&#34;) and has a high-tech design of black and silver grills with easy to see and use buttons. It weighs about 2.5 pounds but there is a carrying pouch that wraps tightly around it so you don't have to remove it to enjoy sound\/music (not included).The functions buttons are all on the top including, Power, Bluetooth\/Call Answer\/End, Volume Up\/Down, and the powerful Roar mode. There is also a three-LED battery indicator light (small green lights) and lights for the Bluetooth and Roar mode.Around the back of the unit gives you a power port for a 3.5mm AUX input (adapter included). This is where the USB port exists for charging and the built-in 6,000mAh battery. This gives you up to eight hours of music, but if you play the Sound Blaster loudly, you will use the power up more quickly. Also, 6,000mAh alone will charge an average Smartphone about 2.5-3 times, so plug it in while charging your smartphone. There is also a small Play\/Pause and Forward\/Back buttons for songs along with a Record button and a microphone mute for sound recording. Did I mention the Loud Sounds switch, the Alarm arming switch or the Alarm button? It really is a welcome assortment of overkill.If you are going to spend the money for the Sound Blaster Roar, you will get your money's worth. The amount of functions and the audio performance are so well designed and constructed, I don't think anything else is out there that comes close. I am really impressed with this device. It's about time a company designed and produced a great multi-function Bluetooth speaker system that is actually affordable and worth every penny!Product supplied for a fair and honest review.","rating":5},{"comment":"The names Creative Labs and Sound Blaster are legendary among computer enthusiasts because they brought sound and especially music to computers. Early personal computers had no sound other than what was provided by a quarter-sized speaker only capable of making strange beeps and clicks people associated with old computers.The Sound Blaster quickly became the standard for adding high quality sound to the PC, first with an internal card and later using the USB connection. Sound Blaster is still THE name in PC audio cards with their high-end X-Fi Titanium product that they say can create three dimensional (3D) sound so accurate that gamers can locate their opponents by sound before they can even be seen.And now there is the Creative Sound Blaster Roar SR20A which redefines the simple Bluetooth speaker with five drivers including a built-in subwoofer. Power well beyond its modest size, the quality sound that sends music pumping out in seemingly every direction, filling surprisingly large areas with screaming highs and thumping bass, the speaker also has a number of well-executed, unexpected capabilities.I first heard about this speaker when a friend returned from the Consumer Electronic Show (CES) in Vegas last January. He said there was always a large crowd gathered around the Creative Labs booth where the new Roar was being demonstrated. He was impressed by what he saw and heard, but even after his slightly embarrassing gushing, I had no idea of all of the speaker's functions. After finally having one in my hands, and here is the list of everything it can do.Wireless speakerI use the Bluetooth 3.0 connection to play tunes from my iPod, tablet and laptop. The Bluetooth is seriously enhanced on the Roar, with 3 different Link Security (LS) modes controlled by a switch on the back,: connect two devices at once (LS mode 2, the default) and play one at a time, restrict to previously pared devices only (LS mode 1), or allow any device to grab control from the current device (LS OFF mode).It also supports near field communication (NFC) so you can connect by tapping the music player on the Roar. For conventional Bluetooth pairing, press the large tactile silicon button closest to the middle of the top of the unit (the multi-function button) and hold until the normally yellow light turns white and begins to blink. A voice says \"Pairing mode, waiting for a device to connect.\"The other buttons on the top are plus and minus to control volume, the Roar button, and the power button. The Bluetooth is very powerful, connecting instantly to my iPod from 15 feet away and staying connected even when I took the iPod into another room. Bluetooth modes supported are: A2DP (Wireless Stereo Bluetooth), AVRCP (Bluetooth Remote Control), and HFP (Hands Free Profile) for phone use - see below.Hands-free phoneWhen the phone rings while connected to the speaker using Bluetooth, pressing the multi-function button will answer the call, with the caller's voice clearly heard on the speaker. The Roar's built-in microphone is sensitive enough to conduct a phone conversation while several feet away. Pressing the record button during the call will create an audio file copy of the call in the Voice folder of the MicroSD card. Holding the multi-function button down for two seconds or more when the phone rings, causes the call to be ignored.Electric guitar practice amplifierPlug the guitar into the AUX IN port and play through the Roar. I have only been able to do this before with other speakers by first connecting the guitar to another device (the iRig from IK Multimedia) and then to an iPod, and then to the speaker. Plugging directly into the Roar I can be playing in seconds without worrying about the daisy chain of devices hanging out of my guitar. The sound was excellent and plenty loud to work as a practice amp at home or on the road.Portable file storageConnected the Roar to a PC through the USB connection, and copied files to the MicroSD card inserted in the Roar. MicroSD class 4 and above cards are supported with capacities up to 32 gigabytes (GB) when formatted as FAT16\/32 drives.Portable music playerUsing the MicroSD card created above, the Roar is a portable music player, using the controls on the back to skip forward or backward, play the WMA, WAV, and MP3 music song files randomly, or repeating them depending on the switch setting.Battery ChargerI charged my iPod and phone to full strength using the built-in 6,000 mAh (milliamp hours) battery through the DC OUT USB connection on the back of the Roar. One of the three battery strength lights on the Roar went out after the charging was complete, indicating that about 30% of the battery power had been used.Sleep or stay-awake aidPlayed music all day, switching between Bluetooth and MicroSD, then went to sleep with the Roar gradually reducing the volume and turning itself off. I also tried the stay awake feature that plays loud voices to startle you awake, which was annoying, but effective.Alarm SirenSwitching the alarm switch from Off to Arm and pressing the Alarm button starts a loud undulating siren. Not quite as loud as a true home alarm siren, it is still plenty ear-splitting. Slide the switch back to off to stop it. If you got lost in the forest, this would help rescuers find you quickly.Computer Audio SystemConnected the Roar with USB to a Windows PC with no speakers or audio drivers, and loaded the SoundBlaster control panel software from the website. The SoundBlaster control panel includes the SBX Pro Studio which enables the creation of sound templates that can be loaded on the Roar to tailor the sound to different sources and environments.There are 9 pre-made templates that will probably suit most needs without creating new templates. Templates are loaded to the Roar by clicking or touching them, it is as simple as that. My favorite for both music and video viewing is the Stadium Surround that uses special effects to trick your ears into hearing spacious surround sound that I find really enhances the experience.The other 8 provided templates are SBX Default, Warm Sound, Smart Volume, Dynamic Boost, Night Sound, Clear Dialog, Clear Comms, and Cinematic Action. Without the Roar, sometimes it is difficult, even with the volume cranked all the way up, to hear dialog and music from videos playing on my laptop. With it, there is enough headroom to blow the roof off.Sound EnhancementsPressing the Roar button acts as a loudness enhancer when maximum power is desired, such as in noisy environments. Using this feature seemed to significantly boost the bass and vocal range of the speaker. The manufacturer also recommends plugging in the power adapter which also provides extra volume compared to battery mode operation.There is also a \"Tera Bass\" mode that, if desired, boosts the bass levels at lower volumes. It is activated by pressing the Alarm button on the back of the unit while the music is playing. While the bass did seem slightly over emphasized using this feature, I liked it, though that is purely subjective, dependent upon the user and type of music being played.AccessoriesA Mega Stereo Cable is available, allowing two Roar speakers to be used together, with the Master left speaker controlling the right speaker as a slave. And, a mesh carrying case permits the speaker to be easily transported and the mesh panels permit it to be played without removing the case or muffling the sound.The Roar has joined my cell phone, iPod, and PC as essential technical devices used throughout the day. The quality, seemingly endless features and reasonable price make this device beyond impressive. Opportunities are continually presenting themselves to put it to use to improve the experience of whatever activity is occupying my time. There is no going back.Review unit provided by Creative without obligation.","rating":5},{"comment":"I am not an acoustical expert nor a musician or a DJ. But I know what sounds good to my ears. And this speaker sounds fantastic! I've listened to popular, R&B and jazz and all of them sounded great! The highs were crisp and the lows were clear. The other features worked great too. When using my phone text messages and phone calls worked flawlessly. I've yet to use all of the features since I've only had the product a few days but I expect them to work great as well. I usually wait a few months before reviewing a product but with this being new I thought I would write one to give those on the fence an objective opinion. If you purchase this you won't be disappointed. But if anything changes I'll follow up this review.","rating":5},{"comment":"Very impressive. Loud, clear and audiophile quality. Worth the $150.","rating":5},{"comment":"[Please read this review for full details and watch the updated video for an illustration of the various audio modes]After having owned and listened to more portable Bluetooth speakers than I can count, it's hard to put a finger on what sounds \"good\" vs. what sounds \"impressive\". I have speakers all over my house so I never have to carry one with me, and I'm trying to learn which ones sound best in which rooms and for which types of music. I own a specialty speaker all-in-one that is not in the size\/price category of Bose, Jawbone, Creative or any of the ones that can fit on the palm of your hand that I keep it in my den and for an all-in-one unit the sound it produces is just magical. It's 20x larger than the Roar and 3x the price but the Roar sounds amazingly good in direct comparison. The size of the Roar, by the way, is only 2.2\" x 7.9\" x 4.5\" and weighs just 2.5 lbs.Let's get the suspense out of the way ... the Sound Blaster Roar not only causes you to drop your jaw in disbelief, it is also very listenable over the long term with practically any music genre. Due to the driver arrangement, the width and depth of the soundstage when listening in a typical interior room and side-by-side with a Bose Wave radio is virtually identical. In fact I like it better than any of the other palm-size speakers I have tried, and yes that does include Bose. So much so that as of now this is the one that will travel with me to make boring hotel rooms come alive with music or videos played on my iPad sound more like I'm listening to them on my home surround system.There's no need to dwell how good this speaker sounds, the only way you will really know how it sounds is to listen to one live in-person using the music you like, at the volume you like, in the room you will use it the most. If it pleases you, it is the right choice for you. If you don't like the sound, it's time to return it and move on. There is simply no other way to know if this is the right choice for you.So, how about other things like how well it is constructed, controls, battery life, etc?Let's start with first impressions. There are certain products that are appropriately to referred to as \"crafted\" rather than manufactured, like a Bentley, a Rolex or a finely tailored suit. They stand out in their design from other products of their genre. That is the first impression of the Roar, it looks and feels much more expensive than it is. It is knock-dead beautiful. Most of the inputs\/outputs, switches and levers on the Roar are gathered together at the back of the unit where they would not normally be seen.The controls are well-labeled however and very unlike Bose are not all monolithically and monochromatically lined up and hard to read. They are in fact class-leading in the ease in which a new user can quickly learn to operate the speaker without an instruction manual.But don't throw that instruction manual away just yet. While the basic controls are easy to figure out, some of the functions they perform are a little more obscure. Like being able to record sound from its built-in microphone to a micro SD card or performing as a high-quality speakerphone (whose audio can also be recorded). You can also set it to be able to accept sound from two different Bluetooth devices at once and instantly switch back and forth between them. Of course, you can't play both simultaneously. There's also the ability to set a sleep mode that gradually reduces the output volume as a user falls asleep.As you read the various reviews about the Roar you will see references to two very unusual functions (usually accompanied by a snicker). One is the Life Saver mode which was intended to play random odd sounds to help keep you awake. I say \"was\" because that feature has been replaced on the brand-new release model of the Roar, which is now the SR20A, with a new function called Link Security which has 3 modes. The first gives you a private Bluetooth connection so no one else has access to your Roar. The second allows you to share Bluetooth access only with your friends. And the third is a \"free for all\" mode where anyone can tune in and play jams on your Roar. This seems to be something teachers will appreciate ... they can let classmates share their input into one sound system or activate the private mode so only they have access.The other new feature of the new Roar SR20A (sold after July 4, 2014) is Terra Bass, which shares the siren button. The Terra Bass button intelligently boosts bass when audio levels are low in a way similar to the loudness switch on some stereo amplifiers. Terra Bass and the Roar button can be used independently or together. If you activate them at high volume levels the result is impressive but sounds over-processed in a way similar to the Bose Mini. Unlike with the Bose, however, with this speaker the effect can be turned off. Not to worry, the siren button is still there, and can be turned on\/off with a slide switch. Educators\/business trainers\/meeting leaders will like the Roar as a portable and very loud device to amplify the output of video\/data projectors. Because of the multi-input capability they can also run music during the break and even call the attendees back together using the loud siren button.The Roar breaks from the mold in terms of its overall design in that it is intended to lay flat like a cigar box. That has some intended yet unusual positive consequences one of which is with the subwoofer pressing the unit downward it does not have a tendency to \"walk\", in other words many of the other similar speakers, when playing at high volume, will creep backward. Yes, I've actually have one fall off of a table.The Roar has a total of five drivers and two amplifiers. A large central active excursion driver and its associated two passive radiators on each end powered by its own amplifier plus two 1.5-inch high-end drivers are powered by another amp. The speakers are aimed in three different directions to fill a room with sound creating a wide and realistic soundstage instead of creating specific sweet-spots. Sound quality, especially the bass frequencies, is very subjective. For that reason it's wise to be wary of reviews that over-dramatize the reviewer's personal impression of the sound of ANY speaker system as being \"the best\" or \"weak bass\" or terms like that. What applies to that particular listener may not, and probably will not, apply to you. The ONLY way to know if you will be able to live with the sound of a speaker is to audition it, either in a store, or preferable at home. If you buy from any reputable vendor they will allow you to return it if you hate the sound. For that reason I strongly recommend that you do not base your final judgment on any review, mine included, but only use them as a guideline.As far as the rest of what you should know - not only does the case look classy, it looks like it is relatively durable. It is constructed in subtle shades of dark gray with contrasting brightly chromed end and non-slip silicone textures including a silicone-padded surface to protect furniture and prevent slipping. The speaker as tested does get about 8 hours on a charge on its 6,000 mAh Li-ion battery.Creative is a reputable company and my dealings with them have been positive; it is possible to get through to real humans. They kindly provided an initial sample release unit for testing, but be assured all opinions are mine. At the price point this speaker, in my opinion, it could compete on an equal footing with brands like Bose, Klipsch and others and frankly I think it could compete with speakers priced at $299 equally well. Instead it is being sold for 25% less than the Bose Mini.I don't believe in comparing speakers by pointing a video camera at them. First off, the built-in microphones in 95% of home video cameras are very  low-fi. Maybe more important than that is that speakers \"emit\" sound in different ways. The Bose Mini for example emits the majority of its sound from the front, if you walk around to the back of the speaker the quality of the sound changes dramatically. The Roar, on the other hand, emits sound from the front, top and both endcaps. Pointing a camcorder at the speaker will only \"hear\" the part of the speaker the camera is pointed at which is nothing at all like what you will experience in a typical listening setting. That being said, the accompanying video is not intended to judge or compare the overall sound quality, but rather to give you the opportunity to hear the difference between the 4 audio modes while listening to the same audio track. For that comparison professional studio microphones were used.Here's a checklist of the features, some of which were not detailed here:1. Currently selling at Amazon for $149.992. Bi-Amplified design3. Roar for instant additional audio power4. Bluetooth with aptX and AAC music streaming5. Digital USB connectivity6. Analog mini plug connectivity7. Integrated WMA\/MP3 player using microSD\/micro SDHC card8. NFC technology9. Multipoint technology to permit simultaneously connecting two Bluetooth devices10. Capable of charging a smartphone as an emergency backup11. Bedtime mode gradually reduces volume as you fall asleep12. Built-in audio recorder13. High quality speakerphone with record capability14. Helpful subtle voice prompts (which can be turned off)15. Downloadable Sound Blaster control panel for PC\/Mac with pre-defined audio profilesIn summary, portable Bluetooth speakers are one of the most popular consumer electronics accessories lately, and there are countless shapes and sizes, some from well-respected manufacturers and many from no-name companies. Some sound great and some sound terrible. Some have an impressive first impression but are not musically pleasant for long-term listening. One of the best known for the past year or so has been the Bose Mini which certainly ticks all the boxes when it comes to design, build quality and impressive sound in a small package. The Sound Blaster Roar is a worthwhile competitor that looks and sounds like it should cost more not less than the Bose. If I had both of them before me and only could keep one and it was agreed that they both sound great I wouldn't hesitate to choose the Roar for at least two reasons ... one, that it is not as directional, making it less picky as far as placement and more definitely suitable for outdoor use. And two, the Roar is just more versatile.[Added a week later] - wanted to share a cool use of the Link Security feature. We had the Roar set up at an outdoor barbecue where each person loaded the songs they wanted to hear using their smartphone. We were able to replicate the concept of those old-time juke boxes where people would insert their money and pick a song or two and then the juke box would play the songs in sequence for the night while you waited for your \"favorite\" to play. Our experience was very similar except as each song ended the next person had to try to \"beat\" the others by being the first to hit Play because Bluetooth can only play from one device at a time (but the Roar can be linked to the whole gang's phones).All things considered I believe Creative has scored a winner and earns a solid 5-star rating.","rating":5},{"comment":"Bluetooth speakers have improved a lot over the past couple of years, but I never thought I'd hear one that sounds this good, especially at this size and price range. This speaker has a solid, substantial look and feel. It has 5 drivers and a built-in subwoofer so it also sounds substantial and solid. The sound fills our kitchen\/family room\/dining area which is around 45' x 24' with bump outs for a dining area and lots of windows and doors, and 10 foot ceilings. Yeah, it's an acoustical nightmare. But the ROAR fills this Great Room with crisp, clear sound and amazing bass. People that walk into the room invariably ask where the sound is coming from and have a hard time believing this little device is ROARing out this amazing sound!I know that Creative has a solid reputation in the area of sound. My very first purchase of a computer add-on 2 weeks after buying my first computer was a Creative Sound Blaster sound card which I installed, with their instructions, having never seen the inside of a computer before. And it worked right away! So I became a loyal customer, installing several of their sound cards over the years. I'm glad they have reinvented the Sound Blaster in some of these new products.This speaker has a bi-amplified design meaning it has dual opposing sound radiators with five drivers. These disperse frequencies forward while the active bass unit disperses midrange sound upward for height while the side firing radiators deliver the bass that fills the room, even a large one like ours which is a real challenge for any speaker system let alone a single speaker such as this. Walking into this room you would never suspect such room filling sound could accomplished by this little device. This not only sounds great &#34;for its size&#34; but for any size. It sounds a whole lot larger than it actually is.Besides it's amazing sound the Sound Blaster Roar has a bunch of other great features. It has a high-quality microphone for clear voice pick up, making useful for speakerphone teleconferencing or just answering your smart phone. It has integrated MicroSD, WMA MP3 players meaning that you can play music directly from a microSD card without having to connect another device. (You can also connect a device with a cable with 3.5m connectors.) It has an integrated voice recorder, with one touch audio recording of voice calls of music directly to a microSD card. If you have an NFC enabled device you can connect it via Bluetooth. You can also connect two Bluetooth enabled devices at the same time. There are lots of link security modes so you can control how Bluetooth devices are able to connect the ROAR.It comes with a plug-in battery charger and provides about eight hours of continuous audio playback. You can also charge your smart phone with it. You can connect via USB to a PC or Mac computer. SoundBlaster Control Panel software is available for free download that will enable advanced audio processing. A lot of thought and engineering went into this speaker and it shows. Quite simply, the best Bluetooth speaker I have heard so far. Two thumbs up!I received a sample of this speaker from Creatve for testing and review.","rating":5},{"comment":"Super sonic speaker system! Can you say that 5 times fast?","rating":5},{"comment":"Disclosure: I received a free sample of this item to review by virtue of being a frequent Amazon reviewer. I rarely accept such invitations, but I did here because frankly, I wanted to know if this was a good bluetooth speaker. The verdict is: YES! The sound features crisp trebles and rich bass sound that comes together for a very pleasant listening experience. We rocked with this for several hours and still had 2 of 3 LEDs going, so the battery seems to be quite good, which is important since for me the whole point of a bluetooth speaker is portability.  My son has reported getting about 8 hours of service out of this speaker on one charge.  This is a terrific speaker for backyard barbecue parties and the like.This unit is beautifully made -- no one can fault the fit-and-finish here. You can play music directly from your computer through this speaker, from a MicroSD card (there is a slot for this) or do what I usually do and stream music from your iPhone or iPad. This little speaker does it all.For the price listed on Amazon this speaker is competitive for best of class. The sound is as good as my Bose Mini, and better than my Jambox. Creative is going to sell a zillion of these at these prices. RJB.","rating":5},{"comment":"My short review:If you have the money to spend on this speaker, don't walk, RUN to the order button and just buy it. This is easily the best sounding portable speaker I have ever heard, and if you pair them it is likely the sound from these two devices will trounce what most normal people usually listen to music on at home.I have heard several Bose options from the higher end BT speaker side, and countless BT speakers from the low end side from all sorts of vendors. This is the first time, in all my testing, that I can say that the price belies the tremendous capability of this speaker.Very highly recommended.Longer review:Creative Labs was the audio darling of the PC sound card world. Their cards were top of the class, providing advanced features and capability that PC gamers and audiophiles craved. Then Intel and others begin including audio components on their motherboards and chip sets, and Creative lost their way. The mighty fell.Thankfully, they have soldiered on, continuing to provide top of the line audio cards and audio capability to computer users, but at a lesser capacity than their heyday. Now they are focusing on other areas of audio, and this speaker is just one of the areas they spent a ton of research and development time\/resources to make it sound nothing short of amazing. And they succeeded, hands down, making me realize how much I miss the old days of PC building...The sound from the Roar Portable Bluetooth Speaker is nothing short of amazing. I received a free sample from Creative for review purposes and wasn't overly excited by the idea of reviewing yet another Bluetooth Speaker. But then it arrived, I opened it and connected it to my computer and... my jaw was on the floor. I have never been this surprised by a BT speaker in my years of reviewing on Amazon.Opening the box, you don't get the \"Apple Ecstasy\" of a premium product opening. To me, that's not a huge deal, but the feeling of wow of unboxing could match the absolute feeling of WOW when you power it on and hear how amazing it sounds.There are a ton of ways to provide audio to the speaker, they include:Bluetooth (you can connect up to 2 devices at a time, though only one will play audio obviously)NFC (if you aren't aware, NFC is just an easier way to connect BT devices that support it)3.5mm inputMicroSD (up to 32 GB capacity only, higher capacity does NOT work, I tried)USB input to your computer as a USB sound card (this offers a ton of control for your audio if you choose this option)Added features:You can charge your phone w\/ the built in battery via USBThere is an \"alarm\" feature for getting people's attentionBluetooth is using BT 3.0, instead of BT 4.0, but don't let that fool you, it still sounds amazing and supports A2DP (can also be used as a speaker phone).The audio out of this single speaker is nothing short of amazing. Highs are high. Lows are low. Mids are mid. It sounds exactly what you should expect from a high quality speaker.Part of why this sounds so amazing is that it utilizes two amplifiers. One amp is focused on lows and mids. The other is focused just on providing accurate highs. At max volume, there is no distortion. And the amount of bass from this, when it is sitting on a flat surface, is quite thumping. There are essentially 3 speakers in the box. Two are 1.5 mm and a single down firing 2.5 mm driver that is designed to pump out bass. The grills on the side are designed to throw the bass around, and filling a room with sound is an easy proposition.When using the Roar, be sure to place it on a flat surface with the power button facing UP. This will ensure audio plays back correctly in terms of audio quality. It CAN play in other configurations, but the problem there is that you really change the acoustics, and in the case or putting the power button facing down, the sound becomes harsh. Most people wouldn't do this, so I'm just mentioning it, just in case.I am, right now, placing an order for a second speaker to use this is true stereo mode. Just the quality from a single speaker is this good, I can only imagine how great it will sound with the stereo feature working.Features:SpeakerphoneVolume up\/downPower on\/offmic input for recording audio to MicroUSB (and a built in mic for speakerphone that can be used to record audio notes and record calls)LS1 and 2, plus the off switch just allow 1 or 2 devices to connect to the speaker, turning this off allows everyone to pair with itTerrabass (also works as the siren button) for more intelligent bass as you turn the volume down, similar to night or midnight mode on a stereo or surround receiverRoar mode turns on a loudness option. You lose audio fidelity with this setting, but in a party setting you won't notice and it will toss sound more fully and completely around the room....Playback time from the battery seems to be in the 6-8 hour range for me. If you connect your phone to charge, and if you are using Bluetooth for connectivity, expect lower battery life. If you are using this at maximum volume, expect the battery life to be lower.Overall:In the end, at the current Amazon price, this speaker's audio quality is impossible to match elsewhere for even $50 more. It is also packed with features. I can't wait for my second speaker to arrive to test this is stereo configuration.Very. Very. Highly recommended.(As stated, I received a free sample from Creative for review purposes, and now I'm purchasing a second)Pros:Great sound for the priceTons of connection and playback optionsLoudness (Roar) button helps fill a packed room with soundGreat build qualityCons:Battery life can take a beatingPlacement certainly helps to ensure proper audio responseWhen using the stereo option (2 Roar speakers together), you can only playback via BT\/NFC, USB to a computer or MicroUSB (disappointing IMO, since I would love to connect this to my AUNE amp with this configuration)For those wondering what I listened to via this speaker (this is over BT and connected to my PC through my AUNE and a 3.5mm cable):Pink Floyd - Wish You Were HereHalo Combat Evolved AnniversaryHalo Combat EvolvedSeveral Mozart piecesDavid Bowie - Space Oddity\/Earthling\/Ziggy Star DustMoody Blues - Days of Future PastHikaru Utada - Various tracksGuns N Roses - Best ofDerek and the Dominoes (Eric Clapton)Lord of the Rings Complete Recordings (various tracks from the 3 sets)UrusenTrans Siberian Orchestra - Dreams of FirefliesCannibal Corpse - various tracksNapalm Death - various tracksEverything sounds great. I prefer my B&W; 683s through my receiver, but from my computer, this is more than good, it's great.EDIT 15\/7\/2014 - I have found that if you have a USB cable connected to your ROAR and you then use the stereo input, you may hear some buzzing interference. I solved this by simply unplugging the USB cable while using the speaker w\/ stereo in.Also, I purchased a second ROAR to test the stereo capability. Unfortunately, the Mega Stereo Cable isn't available from Creative in the US yet. And you can't order from the Singapore site (which has it in stock). I tried a standard 3.5mm to 3.5mm stereo cable, it doesn't work. I tried a Beats audio cable (the Creative picture shows 3 connection points, so I thought maybe a mic cable would work). This didn't work either.EDIT- the Roar \"Mega Stereo Cable\" is now available and I have had the absolute pleasure of hearing 2 Roar speakers roaring in unison. The effect is nothing short of phenomenal. The inner audiophile inside of me is all sorts of tickled and amazed at just how great one speaker sounds, and how much BETTER it sounds with two. Don't get me wrong, you don't NEED 2 Roar speakers to get some fantastic music, but just know that you CAN connect 2 and get sound that will truly knock socks off and give true stereo sound.I am now anxiously awaiting Creative listing the Mega Stereo Cable on their website so I can order it. If the effect isn't awesome, I'm sending the second speaker back and will eat the cost of the Mega Stereo. I'll update my review once I have the ability to test this out.EDIT- I received the Roar Mega Stereo Cable today. I've been listening intently for quite some time and I have to say, just as I edited within the review proper, the sound is absolutely fantastic. Very, very impressive. I wish you could connect analog to the master speaker and have it play, but coming over the USB connection to my PC, and via BT on my phone, I don't hear any issues at all. If you have the means, two Roars are better than one, and one alone is still nothing short of phenomenal.","rating":5},{"comment":"The Creative Sound Blaster Roar has a powerful sound in a relatively small and easily transportable package. Recently I have had the opportunity to test and review many different Bluetooth speakers and there is definitely a wide range in both quality and sound performance. The Sound Blaster Roar is at the top of the list for performance. While I do not consider myself an \"audiophile\" I do love music and listen to music often. One of the problems I have encountered with many of the other units is a significant lack of bass. The Sound Blaster Roar delivers in the bass department and did not disappoint. Additionally, many units have a distorted sound at higher volumes but I did not encounter that with the Roar.Aspects about the Creative Sound Blaster Roar that I like include:+ Stylish+ Excellent build quality and durability+ Very detailed and specific user documentation+ Battery provides up to 8 hours of music before it needs to be recharged+ Small and light enough to easily transport (Comes with a carry case)+ I have not experienced any connectivity problems+ Sound is superb to include bass, treble, low, mid, and hi ranges. The sound is also very clean and distinct with no distortion even at a high volume.+ Set up and connectivity to the Bluetooth was very quick and easy (less than 1 minute)+ Provides a large, deep, and rich sound in a multidirectional manner so that your music fills the room+ Provides a lot of functionality such as: MicroSD card slot for your music, microphone to record conversations, can charge your Smartphone, bedtime mode that gradually fades volume,and moreOverall Assessment:Sound is a very individualized experience and depending on your expectations, hearing, likes\/dislikes, environmental factors, room size, etc. your experience with this unit may be different. For me, I find the Creative Sound Blaster Roar exceptional. Actually this unit performs exceptional at any price point. I have used other Bluetooth speakers in this price range that do not come close to the sound and functionality of this speaker. You may ask, \"Are there better speakers available?\" and the answer is yes but those units will be much more expensive and generally larger. I am confident when I state that you will not find a better speaker at this price. I will be using this unit on a daily basis. While you may not need all the functionality that the Sound Blaster Roar provides you will be more than happy based on the sound alone. Highly recommended.Item provided for review purposes.","rating":5},{"comment":"Move over Bose, JBL and Klipsch! There's a new portable Bluetooth speaker and it's nothing short of amazing what this book-sized speaker sounds like. If you're on the fence this summer in deciding what to get, you need to go ahead and buy the Creative Sound Blaster Roar. It's the best speaker right now on the market. It's big enough to fill a room with sound but still portable enough to take with you to a friend's house, on vacation or business trip. It's looks awesome and sounds amazing. Five out of five stars!Why buy *this* portable Bluetooth speaker?This is what you need to consider when buying a portable speaker these days: Sound volume and fidelity, build materials and construction and (most importantly for your pocketbook) value and price.Here's why I own a Sound Blaster Roar:I set this up in my bedroom and streamed music from Google Play, and I had the Roar set up on my nightstand, behind me. I was immediately impressed with not only the VOLUME of sound, but the actually CLARITY and DEFINITION of what was being played. How can a book-sized speaker fill-up a room and sound so incredibly clear??!?If you're an audio nerd you'll know this is why this speaker is so amazing. If you want to cut though all the marketing hype with other speakers and want to buy the \"best\" portable speaker on the market today, the information below is what you need to compare to other speakers in this class:The Sound Blaster Roar is one of the only portable speakers that uses TWO SEPARATE AMPLIFIERS. One amp in the Sound Blaster Roar is dedicated for high-end frequencies (cymbal crashes, flute sounds and female vocals) and another amp is dedicated to the low-end frequencies (bass guitar, kick drum, thunder sounds.) This is why the ROAR sounds so great! Other battery-powered speakers use a passive system (with only one amp for both high and low end) while the Sound Blaster Roar uses and ACTIVE system that uses two separate amplifiers for some of the best sounding music you'll ever hear.Have you ever heard someone say \"It's like listening to my music for the very first time?\" Well, that's the best way to describe the quality of sounds I was hearing from this speaker. All the instruments and singers were separated in the songs and I could actually hear subtle nuances ( a singer taking a breath, a pick sliding over a guitar sting) I was so impressed that I quit working for a while just to enjoy what I was hearing!There is a \"Roar\" button that acts not only as a loudness button, but also increases the dynamic range of what is being played. It's nice to use when you are at a party or at a place that has a bit of ambient noise. The Roar button helps compensate for the external noise and does a great job without adding any hiss or muddiness to sound. Other speakers don't have this kind of technology, so this is just another great reason as to why I'm such a fan of this speaker.There's a lot of junk on the Amazon masquerading as \"quality-built\" portable speakers. Trust me, I've owned a few zonks. Have you ever picked up something and it just felt cheap and poorly made? The Sound Blaster Roar feels well-built and expensive to the touch. It has a tasteful matte-grey alloy for the speaker grill, with smoked-chrome accents around the side speakers. For sound control, there is a smooth, rubberized button area on the top and around the I\/O ports in the back. The unit has a nice balanced heft to it, but it's not overly heavy or unwieldy to carry around. It really looks nice, and due to neutral coloring of the materials, it looks fine on any counter-top, nightstand, coffee table or executive's desk. It's very well-built.There are also some really cool \"James Bond\" features, which add functionality you just don't get with any other speaker. You might not use them all the time, but they might fall into a category of \"glad to have it and not need it.\"James Bond Add-ons: It has very loud and attention-getting siren function,  it's also a cell phone charger, it has a built-in MP3 player, support for a Micro SD card, AUX IN (1\/8) built-in microphone (for recording) and a Bluetooth feature that lets TWO people control the speaker at one time from two different Bluetooth devices. You can also hook this up (via USB) and use it as your computer's primary speaker system.Believe me when I say this (and I am very selective about quality) there is not a portable speaker on the market today that offers these same features for the price. However, the overwhelming deciding factor for ownership should be sound quality and fidelity, which this speaker delivers!  If you can put your hands on one and hear it, you'll see that this sounds better than other \"premium\" portable speakers out there for 3x the cost. If you are still undecided, look at the other 5 star reviews for this product.If you're on the fence and are looking at other audiophile-grade portable speakers, you just can't pass up the Sound Blaster Roar. I've owned other Creative products (including the AXX) and Creative just keeps raising the bar with products like the Sound Blaster Roar. It's their best speaker to date!","rating":5},{"comment":"Burned these in before listening to them for about 6 hours with my sine waves app.  I've learned from much experience that even the best earphones sound better after a good burn in.  When I finally put them in my ears, I was not disappointed.  The sound on these is really outstanding.  The highs and lows are clear and full.  The bass is punchy without being overwhelming.  The sound is balanced and for me, any type of music I've listened to with these has been stellar.These come with a hard shell case, that I only use to store the extra tips.  The flat, heavily insulated wires don't seem to require any added protection and I can pretty much treat these like they're heavy duty, because they kind of are.  The wires don't tangle and I don't feel like I'm adding too much stress or causing the internal wires any damage.They come with small, medium and large tips along with a bi-flange set and a Tri-flange tip.  For me, the bi-flange is the most comfortable and stays in my ears more securely.You won't be disappointed.--Sample provided-- I have absolutely no obligation to post a review.","rating":5},{"comment":"Some people like DJ style headphones or earbud style headphones. For the audiophile needing a premium experience, you may be interested in the Brainwavz S5 In Ear Headphones.&#9654; Package Contents* Brainwavz S5 In Ear Headphones* Hard Carrying Case* 1 Set Comply Foam tips T-40* 6 Sets Silicon Ear Tips (S, M, L)* 1 Set Silicon Bi-Flange Ear tips* 1 Set Silicon Tri-Flange Ear tips* \" Adapter* Instruction Manual and Warranty Card (24 months Warranty)&#9654; AccessoriesAs other Brainwavz products, these earphones get several accessories that many other earphone brands wouldn't get. The contents come in a very well made hard carrying case, with two pockets, that will protect the earphones and accessories, as long as the damage isn't intentional, such as running your vehicle over it. The silicone tips are either gray or black. I like that this includes several different sized eartips that will work well with any ear size, which translates to sound canceling. This also includes one set of Bi-flange tips and one set of Tri-Flange tips that get optiminal in-ear sound, and foam eartips that tend to become damaged when removing them; no matter how well they improve the product. This also includes the \" adapter for stereos. I love that Brainwavz includes every accessory that you would typically need for a standard set of earphones.&#9654; Specifications* Drivers: Dynamic, 10mm* Rated Impedance: 16 Ohms* Frequency Range: 18 Hz ~ 24 kHz* Sensitivity: 110 dB at 1 mW* Rated Input Power: 20 mW* Cable: 1.3 m Y-cord; Silver-plated* Plug: 3.5mm, gold-plated&#9654; HardwareThe entire length of the earphone wire is 53 inches long. At the base is the gold plated connector, with black rings, that is enclosed by a rubber plastic material. I like that Brainwavz decided to keep the conventional straight connector, as their other connectors are usually at a 125  angle and easily damaged. From the connector, a flat gray rubber wire, 34\" inches to the Y connector, that is approximately 15.75\" inches to the earphones. The earphone casing is metal, although it initially looks like plastic, with the Brainwavz name, the earphones themselves are each tilted inward, probably around 30. These headphones are the successor to the Brainwavz S1, which also had premium sound, and are much lighter than the Brainwavz R3, which are their most expensive headphones. The R3's use more material, which supposedly translates to better sound quality.The earphones are designed to be worn over the ear, giving you the best acoustic experience, but you can choose to wear them directly in your ear. Wearing them over the ear greatly reduce microphonics, which are the vibrations transformed into electrical signals.&#9654; TestingI've tested these headphones for approximately two days, or about 12 hours of listening time, with my Nexus 7 (2013), LG Optimus F6, and Windows 7 PC. I used different genres of music and podcasts to properly gauge the quality of the earphones. The overall sound quality was very clear, and bass was excellent in terms of low, mid, and high bass. You could definitely tell the difference between these and the Brainwavz S1's, but there is little to no difference between these and the Brainwavz R3's. Taking into consideration the weight and size of the R3's, I would purchase these in an instant. During my extended tests, I felt no irritation from the ear tips. I was overall very satisfied by the fit, build, and acoustics of the headphones.&#9654; Final ThoughtsFor the quality and comfort, these headphones are hard to beat, especially for under the $100 range. I personally prefer them over the R3's, which are much more expensive and physically heavier. I would recommend this product to any audiophile needing earphones and give this product a 5 star rating.Pros:+ Clear sound and great bass during testing. I think these are on par with the Brainwavz R3's, a much more expensive earphone.+ Thin, light, and aesthetically pleasing.+ Includes several accessories, which not many other earphone manufacturers make.Cons:- Over the ear styled earphones aren't always for everyone.- Foam tips may become damaged if you take them off.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.","rating":5},{"comment":"I&#8217;m a big fan of the Brainwavz S1 (actually all of their headphones &#8211; have yet to be disappointed with any of their products). The S1 has been my main set for active use (e.g., workouts, runs, etc.) since the flat cable is very durable and resistant to tangles. The S5 keeps all the good features of the S1 and adds to it &#8211; the sound quality is richer and better defined.That&#8217;s not to say the S1 sounds poor &#8211; they are quite good, in fact. But the S5 are better. The highs are better defined and the midrange has more punch to it. The bass comes through clearly without moving into the harsh territory when the volume is pushed (as the S1s can do). The overall sound quality is very pleasing.The build quality seems solid &#8211; as solid as the S1 or better. I love the flat cable! I know that&#8217;s something that is not appreciated by everyone, but for me it&#8217;s been working out wonderfully. Although this (as most other Brainwavz headsets) comes with an excellent hard shell case, I usually tote my earbuds wrapped around my mp3 player in my pocket. Easy to carry; very stressful on the cables and can lead to tangles with round wires. Flat wires, especially those with a thick jacket such as these, survive that abuse with zero problems.The earbuds themselves are more sleekly shaped than the &#8220;can&#8221; style of the S1.Comfort is in line with the customary Brainwavz style, which is to say it&#8217;s outstanding. It comes with a wide range of tips to fit pretty much any ear, plus the Comply foam tips (which are my favorite). If fitted properly you end up with zero ear irritation plus excellent sound isolation and bass response.These are an over-the-ear design much like the S1. I never used that design prior to the S1 and it did take me a little time to get accustomed to it. It became second nature quickly, and the design is a lot more stable when exercising than the conventional in-ear design.These are more expensive than the S1, but you can hear the difference in price. Still, if you&#8217;re looking to keep the cost down a bit, the S1 is an excellent performer as well.Great sound, great comfort, wonderful cable design, and it comes with a solidly made case and lots of eartips. Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]","rating":5},{"comment":"I've used theBrainwavz S1 In Ear Headphones, and they had outstanding audio quality. I didn't know if anything could top the S1 earphones, but Brainwavz has done just that with the S5, I believe. The audio quality is superb, they're as comfortable as any in-ear headphones that I've used, and the manufacturer has spared no attention to detail.Regarding the audio quality, I didn't notice a huge difference compared to the S1 earphones, but to my ears, the bass was more pronounced - not overwhelming but very noticeable, and it sounded great, especially with bass-heavy music. Vocals had great clarity, and instrumentals sounded as rich as I've heard on any earphones.The S5 kit includes a variety of earphone tips, and I can't imagine anyone not being able to find a pair of comfortable tips. In addition to the medium-size silicone tips that came already installed on the earphones, there are several other sizes and styles, including both bi-flange and tri-flange tips, and a set of Comply memory foam tips. With the earphone tips properly inserted in your ears, outside sounds are eliminated or at least heavily attenuated. And if the tips aren't inserted properly, the bass sounds are very weak, so it's important to use the tips that fit your ears the best.Attention to detail is one of the things that make fine products stand out, and with the S5 earphones, those details include a flexible ribbon cable, gold-plated plugs, and a &#34; screw-on stereo adapter plug. And thanks to Brainwavz for a really nice zippered hard case. It's easily the best hard case for a set of in-ear headphones that I've seen.If I had to come up with a complaint, it's a minor one: It's hard to read the &#34;L&#34; and &#34;R&#34; to know which earphone goes in which ear. The letters are on the strain reliefs, and I needed a magnifier to read them.The headphones were provided to me for evaluation and review.","rating":5},{"comment":"Normally when I receive a review sample I can do a thorough evaluation and write a review within two days. This one took longer. The reason is that it took me a while to hear the differences in this model versus theBrainwavz S1 In Ear Headphones, which also impressed me (and I also own).After going through a pile of albums to try to understand what the product description meant by smoother bass I finally found an album that allowed me to hear it:Portrait In Jazz. When Scott LaFaro's bass came in on Autumn Leaves I started switching back and forth between this and the S1, and also hauled out some studio reference monitors. These phones are capable of going down in the 18Hz range for the low end, which is lower than most in ear monitors and phones that are usually in the 20Hz range at the low end. I am not sure my ears can discretely detect the differences between 18 and 20, but I was able to detect nuances that the lower end provided.These also go up a little higher than more phones, which are usually in the 20 KHz range, Again, I am not sure I can truly hear sounds at 24KHz, but there is a discernible difference. I tested that end of the frequency spectrum with a few Ahmad Jamal albums since he tended towards the right side of his pianos.One other thing that took me some getting accustomed to was the over-the-ear way of wearing these. I am use to in-ear or the old fashioned over-the-hear phones and I had to play around with these before I figured out how to place them in my ears perfectly. If you are use to over-the-ear you will probably not experience the learning curve that I did.A few other features that I have come to expect from this brand are here: extra tips of different sizes, a hard case (Brainwavz Hard Earphone Case) and a 1\/4\" adapter. I love the flat, tangle-free cable that is tougher than it feels. And it has an adjuster like a chin strap on a cowboy hat that aids in keeping these firmly in place with the over-the-ear way of wearing them.This is definitely a five star set of phones (according to my way of grading, anyway), and one that I will not hesitate to recommend to fellow musicians. We tend to spend a great deal of time listening to music and these do an excellent job of reproducing it. My advice, though, is to take your time when you first get them because their true power is not immediately apparent. When you do start hearing the difference you will understand why I rated them so highly.","rating":5}]
